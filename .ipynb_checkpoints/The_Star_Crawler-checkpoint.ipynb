      "PETALING JAYA: Sign-ups for the Covid-19 jabs among Malaysians have greatly increased, with spikes of over 1,000% in registrations on certain days.However, there is much catching up to do in some states, with less than half of their population having registered.The country saw huge increases in vaccine registration on the days the opt-in AstraZeneca sign-ups went live, according to The Star's analysis of data by the Special Committee on Covid-19 Vaccine Supply Access Guarantee (JKJAV).The first spike took place on May 2, when over 260,000 AstraZeneca vaccines were on offer to residents in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor.There was a sudden, steep increase of 1,007% when vaccine registrations shot up to 254,458 from the 22,969 registrations just the day before.In the seven days prior to the first round of the AstraZeneca opt-in on May 2, the daily average number of vaccine registration was only 28,113.On May 23, daily registrations bumped up by 87.07% from the day before to 130,321 as the second round of AstraZeneca opt-ins opened up at noon that day.It was opened up to those aged 60 and above living in five states namely Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Johor, Sarawak and Penang, with a total of 1.24 million vaccines available.Another spike was later seen on May 25, the day leading up to when the voluntary AstraZeneca programme would be expanded to those aged 18 to 59.Daily registrations surged by 49.74% from the day prior to 219,258 on May 25.On June 11, vaccine registration rates saw another massive bump, from over 200,000 registrations the day before to a whopping 710,477 sign-ups.Universiti Malaya epidemiologist Prof Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud said that for the spikes in May, the opt-in AstraZeneca registration provided a rational explanation.“This means that many people could not wait for their appointments anymore as they are in the lower priority groups so they went for the AstraZeneca opt-in programme.“The government needs to analyse the data to see if there are any duplicate registrations between the opt-in programme and MySejahtera and also perform detailed analysis by age group and locality.“It can then concentrate on the age groups and areas with low registration rates, and find out the reasons for slow registration and devise plans to deal with this, ” he said, adding that the country needs to target about 300,000 to 500,000 daily doses between now and year-end.In about one month and a half between May 1 and June 15, the number of vaccine registrations grew by an encouraging 20.2% to 13.83 million people.The state which saw the largest percentage increase in vaccine sign-ups was Kuala Lumpur, which had grown by 35.9% to 1,168,192 registrations.This is followed by Selangor (23.4% increase to 3,513,960) and Johor (22.5% to 1,727,211).The states with the lowest growth in sign-up rates were Putrajaya (0.6%), Sabah (8.5%) and Kelantan (16%).The more modest increase in sign-ups is not necessarily a cause for concern as the percentage of Putrajaya's population who have signed up for the jabs is 100%.However, it does indicate that more efforts are needed to boost vaccine registration in certain states that are still seeing a low proportion of their population signing up for jabs.For example, as at June 15, only 24.4% of Sabah’s population signed up for their jabs, while Kelantan still has only 42.3% of its people signed up.Compare this to the 86.6% sign-up rate in Kuala Lumpur and 74% in Selangor.Dr Awang Bulgiba said one way to bolster registrations was for the authorities to identify high-risk individuals with comorbidities, instead of just asking people to voluntarily register.“There are several databases, such as health centre records, which can be used to identify them although they are not necessarily comprehensive and may not contain updated addresses.“They can be matched to the nearest vaccination centre and registration forms can be sent to all registered individuals explaining in simple terms why they need to be vaccinated and how they can sign up, ” he said.Dr Awang Bulgiba said all resources such as health clinics, pop-up centres, and mobile teams need to be deployed.“Outreach programmes can also be done to register and maybe even vaccinate people, as is being done in Kelantan, ” he said, adding that mobile vaccination teams can also be sent out to places of worship or community centres.Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Azmi Mohd Tamil said the low registration rates in certain states could be reflective of the states’ infrastructure and socioeconomic status.“Kelantan and Sabah are the states with lower per capita incomes. Since the registration process requires internet access and devices, this could prove a barrier.“To have a smartphone to register is an enormous obstacle for the B40 groups in Sabah and Kelantan. Indirectly IT literacy is also an obstacle, ” he said.He said in Kelantan, there were also certain leaders who spread false information about the vaccines on their social media channels by deeming it “unIslamic”.Dr Azmi said these people must be engaged with and their arguments need to be countered with facts, \"conveyed in a way they could understand\".In Sabah, he said, having documents to show one’s legal citizenship may also be an issue.“Documents such as birth certificates may not be available, perhaps because births are not registered or documents were sold off for money - so they don’t have a MyKad, which is required at vaccination centres for proof of identity.“There are also issues of illegal papers or fake papers in the interiors of Sabah. Besides poverty, Internet access, lack of infrastructure, there are also issues of proper identity documentation in Sabah, ” he said.Dr Azmi said those with illegal papers need to be assured they will not be arrested or deported after registering for the vaccines.“Since we know Internet access and literacy is a barrier, we need to go back to basics. We have to go down to the ground and register people using alternative pathways.“We must rely on the ‘old methods’ of getting them to come to nearby halls and get them vaccinated. Don’t let technology get in the way, ” he said.Even so, Malaysia needs to nearly double the number of its registration in order to achieve herd immunity.The National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme document states that Malaysia aims to vaccinate at least 23.6 million.As of June 15, about 13.83 million people signed up to receive the vaccines, which means that another 9.77 million people need to sign up to reach the target.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The World Health Organization (WHO) was first alerted on Dec 31,2019, to the presence of several pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, which did not match any other known virus.A week later, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a new virus.The new virus was temporarily named “2019-nCoV.”On Feb 11, the WHO named the disease caused by 2019-nCoV virus as \"Covid-19\", which stands for ‘Corona Virus Disease’.The virus spread rapidly, and exactly a month later on March 11 the United Nations agency responsible for international public health declared a pandemic - the worldwide spread of a new disease.Despite the number of infections, it is important to also note that many people affected by Covid-19 have managed to recover after getting treatment.READ ALSO > Covid-19: Current situation in Malaysia (updated daily)Any outbreak of an infectious disease has a ramping-up period, followed by a peak of intensity, then a decline, giving a bell-shaped curve.The following is a map showing the distribution of Covid-19 cases:\n",

      "Letting GoHow Parents of Young Autistic Adults are Teaching IndependenceBY IVY SOONFor individuals with autism, the journey into adulthood is fraught with difficulties.Fortunately for some, they have parents determined to lead them to independence so they can live with purpose and dignity.One day at a time.....Years ago, Zuraidah Khusaimi thought that was how she would face her son Muzaffar’s autism because otherwise , his challenges were simply too overwhelming.In those early difficult days, she struggled to cope with her son’s autism.“I’d give his sisters crayons and they’d colour.\"But though the days were long, the years were short.Muzaffar is now 22 and Zuraidah and her husband Ahmad Fairuz Ahmad Seth have long recognised that they needed to prepare Muzaffar for the future.He has come a long way and is now able to take on tasks such as baking muffins from scratch with minimal supervision.Although he still doesn’t take too well to changes in routines and disruptions, Muzaffar is usually calm and amiable, and is able to handle social outings and even travelling.He is verbal though not chatty, and able to engage in conversations and occasionally grumble about his workload and obligations.Muzaffar was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder when he was nine.“At that time, we didn’t know much about autism. It was not a known disorder then,” relates Fairuz, a software engineer.They transferred Muzaffar to a school with integrated special classes, and explored various therapies to help him.He was in a government secondary school until he was 18.“His sisters are aware and involved. They include Muzaffar in their activities and outings.\"\"They catch movies together and chat about films they like,” says Fairuz who tries to expose Muzaffar to different experiences.Though they worry about Muzaffar’s future well-being, Fairuz and Zuraidah are not placing the responsibility of looking after him solely on their daughters’ shoulders, and are determined to help Muzaffar be self-reliant and independent.“We don’t believe in keeping him hidden at home,” stresses Fairuz who is a certified tennis coach for individuals with special needs.He is training Muzaffar, aiming for him to compete in tennis at the Paralympics.Muzaffar also plays the drums and goes travelling with his family.“As parents, we want the best for our children. We have always focused more on him because he needed more attention,” says Fairuz who has been proactive in seeking ways to equip Muzaffar for independence.Over the years, they have instilled in Muzaffar the importance of work and being self reliant, and their efforts have instilled in their son discipline and diligence.Although there are private companies that offer employment to young adults with special needs, not all understand or have the capacity to create inclusive working environments.There is a need to also train and educate colleagues and the public so there is acceptance and understanding of the complex difficulties individuals with autism might have in communication and social interactions.There is also always the fear of bullying and abuse as individuals with autism lack social understanding and are somewhat naive.“He sold his muffins at a cafe and also at autism events.\"\"We had orders from family and friends, and it was going well.\"\"We have sold over 4,000 muffins since 2019. But then, the pandemic hit, and we couldn’t sell at the cafe and at events,” relates Fairuz, who introduces his son as an entrepreneur.With more children diagnosed with autism now, there is an urgent need to scale up services they need, says Assoc Prof Dr Hasnah Toran who hasresearched autism in Malaysia for the past two decades.She is most known for her work at the UKM autism lab and used to head Permata Kurnia, a centre that offers services for those with autism.“We need more child psychiatrists to diagnose autism early so that the children can receive early intervention so they can be school ready.\"Government’s health funding goes mostly to tackling heart diseases and cancer, but we need to train more doctors to handle autism. \"\"There are more services available now but they are sporadic and most parents can’t afford early intervention for their children,” says Dr Hasnah who quit her job as a teacher and took a loan to pursue her doctorate in special education in 2002 after her son was diagnosed with autism.Her son is now 25 and Dr Hasnah is also intent on helping him be more independent.She is working to set up a facility for young adults with autism to live on their own and engage in activities such as urban farming.It’s to prepare them to take care of themselves when their parents are no longer around to look after them.With growing awareness of autism, more parents are sending their children for early intervention. But there is a lack of services or employment opportunities for these children as they become older.The biggest obstacle to them gaining and maintaining jobs is the perception that people with special needs are not capable.People with autism want to be accepted and fully included in the workplace, but need support to get there.Apart from sheltered workshops and vocational training in community college, for now it is very much still up to parents to be proactive on helping their autistic children navigate adulthood.Katherine Ho also deems independent living crucial for her son, Jonathan Chia. When he was young, she enrolled him in a government school with integrated special class and got his father to teach him self help skills.Jonathan Chia working on an acrylic art canvas painting project.“Do not waste the formative years of special needs children. \"\"They need to learn self help skills and understand concepts like hygiene.\"\"There are no right or wrong ways of doing things, so don’t make it an issue with your co-parent or teachers.\"\"The priority is always the child’s well being, so set aside the ego,” shares Ho who quit her career in corporate banking to care for Jonathan after he was diagnosed with autism at 3 1/2 years old.Jonathan is now in his mid-20s and is relatively independent.He has self help skills and social understanding but struggles with expressive speech and “is naive”.“We now want to raise awareness on the urgent needs of young adults with autism,” says Ho who has banded with other parents to set up an NGO and a social enterprise to create opportunities for their children to work and be independent.The NGO, Persatuan Kebajikan Sinar Cahaya Istimewa, is based in Kepong, and runs a sheltered workshop where they do handicraft like beading bracelets and packaging sanitiser kits.During this pandemic the young adults working at Persatuan Kebajikan Sinar Cahaya has switched to packing sanitiser kits to earn income.“Our children went through early intervention and pre-vocational training when they were young, and I don’t want all that to go to waste.\"\"This is the next step - preparing for adulthood and independence. We believe in future planning and want to help groom him for the next level,” says Ho who also involves Jonathan’s two siblings in his issues so they are aware of his challenges.But she doesn’t want to impose Jonathan’s care on his siblings and is determined to help him be self-reliant.Despite the challenges brought on by thepandemic which has included shutting down their workshop, Ho and other parents are planning to set up a respite care facility for their young adult children.“We want to train our children to live on their own, so we are setting up a house where they can learn to live independently a few days a week, accompanied by a chaperon and caregiver. There will be a kitchen where they can learn to prepare meals too.“It’s all part of the planning for their future. As parents, we also have to gradually let go,” says Ho.Story: Ivy SoonIllustration: Foo Chern HwanVideo: Shaiful Rizwan Mohd AzharVisualisation and Editing: Sim Leoi LeoiTOPBuilt with Shorthand\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: A total of 5,510,720 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered under the country’s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme as at June 18.The vaccination rate has been rising steadily after getting off to a slow start and on June 17 the number of jabs given daily reached a high of 221,706.The vaccination programme started on Feb 24 with a target of covering at least 80% of the country’s adult population.The following graph shows the percentage of Malaysia's population who have received at least one vaccine dose, versus others in Asean as well as South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and Taiwan.In terms of vaccine registrations, 14,877,336 people have signed up as at June 17.The country recorded a total of 685,204 Covid-19 infections with 615,326 recoveries and 4,276 deaths as at June 18.Among Asean countries, Malaysia currently has the highest cumulative confirmed Covid-19 cases per million people, according to Oxford University's Our World in Data (OWID)website:In terms of Covid-19 deaths per million people among Asean countries, the OWID portal puts Malaysia third behind the Philippines and Indonesia as at June 18, 2021:One of the things health authorities and experts measure when trying to find out where things are headed is the infection’s reproduction number, called R0 (pronounced as “R naught”).The R value refers to the number of people that a person who has the coronavirus will infect.If the R value is 1 for example, it means that on average, one infected person will spread Covid-19 to one other individual.An R value higher than 1 means that the number of cases will increase.However, if the R value goes down - especially below 1 - the disease will eventually stop spreading as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.Malaysia announced its first Covid-19 cases on Jan 25, 2020, involving three tourists who entered via Johor from Singapore on Jan 23.The number of cases then rose to 22 by Feb 16 last year, representing the first wave of cases.The second wave of cases began on Feb 27, 2020, followed by the third wave that began on Sept 20.The following is how the third wave of infections developed in each state and federal territory:\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is fighting its deadliest Covid-19 outbreak since the start of the pandemic amid growing concern about sporadic cases that have come to dominate infections in the country.Sporadic or unlinked transmissions refer to cases that cannot be linked to any cluster. A sharp rise is worrying since it shows that the coronavirus is becoming more entrenched.Many cases recorded in Malaysia used to be linked to clusters, but the situation has changed.Over the past 10 weeks, the percentage of sporadic cases has shot up from 52% in late March to 84.3% in early June, according to the Health Ministry.The number of people who died from a sporadic infection has also surged.An analysis done by The Star found that nearly seven out of 10 infections recorded since the start of the country’s third wave on Sept 20 last year were not directly attributed to a cluster – a possible reflection of a high number of sporadic cases.The analysis was done by counting the number of cases in each of the four broad categories the ministry uses to classify every single infection.Of the 600,407 cases recorded from Sept 20 to June 5, only 32.4% (194,488) were classified as cluster cases. The remaining 67.6% (405,919 cases) fell into the three other categories:A breakdown of the ministry’s figures shows that Selangor has the highest number of cases that were not attributed to clusters (147,250) for the Sept 20 to June 5 period, followed by Sabah (46,629) and Kuala Lumpur (41,334).\"This situation is very worrying, because the majority of new Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 deaths are from sporadic cases,\" Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said in a post on his Facebook page on June 7.He said one factor which is contributing to the trend is the emergence of new, more transmissible and deadly coronavirus variants in the community.As at May 31 this year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has listed four new Variants of Concern (VOC) and six Variants of Interest (VOI).A VOC is a variant of the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus that shows an ability to spread faster, or is more virulent, or which lessens the effectiveness of vaccines.A VOI is a variant suspected to either be more contagious than the original, or causes a more severe infection, or is able escape the protection offered by vaccines. A VOI can become a VOC if more evidence emerges that it does one or more of those things.As at June 4, 2021, a total of 138 infections in Malaysia has been detected from three of the VOCs and three VOIs, including in sporadic cases.Of the 138 infections cause by the new variants, 63 cases (45.7%) were identified as sporadic cases.Sporadic cases identified from close contact screenings were the biggest single source of infections by the Beta (B.1.351) variant, making up 32 of the 104 cases found so far in Malaysia.Malaysia Medical Association president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said poor compliance to the standard operating procedure (SOP), added to unidentified or untested close contacts in earlier Covid-19 cases, may have led to the high number of sporadic cases.\"A significant number of cases are asymptomatic and therefore, with poor SOP compliance when travelling or at the workplace, many would have been unknowingly spread or got infected.\"Over time, the source or index cases would be untraceable or unlinkable,\" he said.While Dr Subramaniam encouraged more extensive contact tracing, he acknowledged the fact that the government's limited manpower and resources may hinder such measures.\"It should also be noted that some people don't use mobile phones but write their names down when registering at restaurants and shops.\"We aren't sure if they are being called and informed in the event there is an outbreak of infections,\" he said, noting that while some may be casual contacts that may not require a swab test, others could unknowingly be under the close contact category.Dr Subramaniam questioned whether those without mobile phones are all truthfully filling out their names and contact details.Apart from speeding up vaccinations, he said the current lockdown should be used as an opportunity to do mass testing.This would help authorities speed up the process of identifying and isolating people who are infected, in line with the WHO's Find Test Trace Isolate and Support (FTTIS) system.\"Individually, we must ensure strict discipline in observing the SOP and avoid or limit contact with people outside the household,\" he said.Dr Subramaniam said the government should consider prioritising vaccinations for the 1.57 million people allowed to be present at work during the lockdown.Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman also agreed that that SOP violations were likely the main contributor to the spread of unlinked Covid-19 cases.She added that in a situation where most individuals do not seriously practise preventive measures, it would be easy for the virus to be transmitted from one person to another.Dr Malina said the higher transmissibility of new variants may also be a reason why the number of sporadic cases is going up.When the third wave started on Sept 20 last year, clusters made up 84.6% of daily cases. By June 1 this year, the figure had fallen to just 14.6%.She said everyone needs to continue practising all recommended public health measures such as washing their hands regularly, wearing masks or double masking, and physical distancing.\"We need to treat other persons who are not family members who stay in the same house as 'positive' until proven otherwise,\" she said, as she advocated for individuals getting vaccinated as scheduled and to practise self-lockdown.Universiti Malaya epidemiologist Prof Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud said the fastest way to tackle the rising number of unlinked infections is to have a total lockdown for two to three months.\"It would mean infections would be confined to just family members and not spread outside the family.\"Having a lockdown with lots of movement and contact between people means unlinked cases will continue to spread,\" he said, adding that vaccination of the community needs to be ramped up so that Covid-19 transmissions can be stopped through herd immunity.Dr Awang Bulgiba said while some may advocate mass testing, it needs to be extensive, done quickly and followed by vaccination to be effective.He urged the government to speed up and combine epidemiological analysis with genomic surveillance to understand the characteristics of newer variants of Covid-19 present in the community.\"If they are different from the ones in 2020, for example, if they affect children more and are more virulent in children, we need to consider vaccinating children too,\" he said.Noting that those below 18 years of age will need to be vaccinated to achieve vaccination for 80% of the population, Dr Awang Bulgiba highlighted that the United States has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 to 18.He said that without faster vaccination rates, the reduction in sporadic cases after two or three months of a strict lockdown may only be temporary.\"If we vaccinate people at an average rate of 300,000 jabs per day, we can cover 80% of the population within the next six months.\"Once this is reached, we should have herd immunity – barring any new variants,\" he said, adding that a sustained reduction in sporadic infections could be seen when about half of the population is vaccinated.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is expected to announce its decision soon on whether children should be included in the country’s Covid-19 immunisation programme.The current plan currently only covers those aged 18 and above, but a growing number of other countries have already started to vaccinate children.The government is currently studying whether Malaysia should follow suit. If the country were to decide to vaccinate its children, what would it involve?According to the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme document, Malaysia currently aims to vaccinate at least 23.6 million people aged 18 and above.Calculations based on the most recent available figures show that vaccinating children aged 12 and above, as several other countries have done, would raise the number vaccinated to at least 26.25 million people.With Malaysia's population currently estimated at 32.77 million according to the Statistic Department's online population clock (www.dosm.gov.my), vaccinating 12- to 17-year-olds could, in theory, help Malaysia reach 80% vaccine coverage.A population vaccination coverage of 80% is often mentioned by experts as a minimum estimate for a country to achieve herd immunity from Covid-19, though there is no exact figure.“Although no one is certain of the percentage of the population required to be vaccinated before we can hinder the spread of Covid-19 in the community, we do know that this will be difficult without vaccinating children,” senior consultant pediatrician Datuk Dr Amar Singh HSS wrote in an article published by the MySinChew news portal.More than three million children in Malaysia aged between 12 and 17 would get vaccinated if the government decides to include the age group.According to the Children Statistics 2020 report, there were an estimated 2.65 million children who are aged 13-17 as of last year (2020).Those aged 7-12 meanwhile total 3.01 million, according to the report released by the department.Selangor had the biggest number of 13- to 17-year-olds as of last year, with about 475,800 followed by Sabah (374,500), Johor (303,400), Sarawak (246,100) and Perak (202,600).Among the countries which have reportedly begun vaccinating children or have approved jabs for children 12 and above are Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, Britain and the United States.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The number of people in Malaysia infected with Covid-19 but who were only taken to hospital after dying of the disease is going up at an alarming rate.In May alone, we saw 123 deaths that the Health Ministry categorises as “brought in dead” (BID). The figure represents 47% of the 261 BID cases recorded in the country this year.Health experts said a detailed study needs to be done to find out why this happening, adding that the trend could be due to two possible factors.The first is that some people infected with Covid-19 did not take their initial symptoms seriously, only to face a rapid deterioration in their medical condition and as a result died before they could be taken to hospital.The second possible reason could be the widespread presence of more virulent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes Covid-19.In any case, the experts said that the worrying trend underscores the importance of people closely monitoring themselves for any possible symptom and sticking to the standard operating procedure (SOP) such as social distancing and wearing masks when out, in order to better protect themselves.As at the end of May, Malaysia has recorded 2,796 Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic reached our shores last year, of which 293 or 10% were classified as BID.The majority of BID cases occurred in Sabah (29%), followed by Selangor (27.6%) and Kuala Lumpur (10.9%).While Sabah had more BID cases last year, this year saw Selangor recording the most number of such cases.In terms of age, most of the BID cases involved patients aged between 60 and 69 (24.2%), followed by those between 50 and 59 (20.5%) and the 70-79 age group (16%). The 30-39 age group made up 8.5% of the overall BID cases in the country.The youngest Covid-19 patient who was brought in dead, in Tawau Hospital on Nov 28,2020, was a four-year-old in Sabah.Most BID cases had a medical history of hypertension and diabetes. However, 31.7% or 93 of the cases did not have any record of medical illness.The Health Ministry said on May 28 that the rising number of BID cases involved three possible scenarios, with the first scenario comprising patients who did not undergo Covid-19 screening despite developing symptoms such as fever and cough.The second scenario involved confirmed Covid-19 patients who were found dead at home before they could be sent to a quarantine centre or hospital.\"Scenario three involves patients who experience the loss of sense of taste and fatigue but did not take these symptoms seriously. The patient only rested at home and after a few days, was found dead,\" the ministry said in a tweet.Universiti Malaya epidemiologist Prof Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud said the rise in Covid-19 patients who are brought in dead to hospitals may be due to several factors, including newer Covid-19 variants which are more virulent, resulting in a more rapid deterioration in the patient’s condition.Another possible reason that the infected person failed to seek proper medical attention quickly enough is that they brushed off their initial symptoms as a common cold or minor cough.\"Other factors may be due medical facilities being far away and not readily accessible, like in remote areas of Sabah and Sarawak,\" he added.In order to ensure infected persons receive the medical attention they need, Dr Awang Bulgiba stressed that a data analysis should be done to determine the type of patients who are likely to deteriorate.\"Factors that can predict disease progression may be modifiable but the correct analysis needs to be carried out to find out what those factors are,\" he said.Dr Awang Bulgiba also proposed that an epidemiological analysis be combined with genomic surveillance to prevent the spread of new undetected variants that will be a threat to the community.“Hardly 0.08% of virus samples are being sent for genome sequencing, ” he said, describing the figure as “dismal.”The medical condition of home-quarantined patients should be monitored more closely through the possible use of mobile applications that would allow the process to be done remotely.Dr Awang Bulgiba urged the government to ramp up vaccination efforts to between 300,000 to 500,000 doses per day.\"With half a million doses per day, the country can achieve herd immunity in just 100 days or within six months if we vaccinate at a rate of 300,000 doses per day.“However, the current rate is far below this number, so this is worrying,\" he added.Commenting on the increasing number of BID cases, Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman said a study involving animals in India has shown that the new coronavirus variant in that country is associated with more severe clinical manifestations.\"We are still studying the clinical data, but I believe the new strains of the virus may play a role in the deterioration of the symptoms,\" she said, adding that there is the possibility of multi-strains infections but should be proven by more research and clinical data.Dr Malina said that among the risk factors of developing severe Covid-19 and deaths are undiagnosed chronic diseases or medical illnesses that can lead to an immunocompromised patient (having an impaired immune system).\"Some of the factors include the person's compliance to put an effort to get and have the prescribed treatment, effort by the caretakers to help monitor the symptoms as well as the general attitude and practice towards SOP compliance,\" she said.She advised those who are infected to closely follow medical advice and to get help from others such as family members, neighbours or friends to keep tabs on them in case their condition worsens.Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy reiterated that delays in seeking medical attention, failure to recognise severe symptoms of Covid-19, and newer variants may have contributed to the rise in BID cases.\"Issues of getting quick access to healthcare especially in the remote interiors in Sabah and Sarawak may also be a factor,\" he said.Dr Subramaniam said proper assessments and monitoring are key to reducing BID cases, with those infected needing to be properly educated on the various Covid-19 categories to know if their symptoms are worsening from mild or moderate to severe.\"The CAC (Covid-19 assessment centre) would need to ensure more thorough assessments and the district health office would need to ensure all patients on home monitoring are checked on regularly.\"The Health Ministry must also be clear on when a patient should seek care at a hospital's emergency department,\" he said, adding that the patient's family or caregiver will need to be on alert to call in for medical attention if symptoms worsen.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Computer science graduate Muadz Halim normally tweets about football and Japanese manga, but when Israel attacked Palestine earlier this month, his focus expanded.The 23-year-old from Perak began to retweet and use pro-Palestine hashtags from early May, at a rate of 80 to 120 times each day.\"I hope that by doing this, I can at least raise awareness among my social media followers that the Palestinians are suffering and that we need to always support and show them solidarity.\"My greatest hope is that Palestine will be free and that there will be no more suffering,” said Muadz, who has racked up a total of 2,707 mentions and retweets on the topic.He is one of an army of local social media users actively spreading awareness on the topic, making Malaysians among the most prolific in the world in terms of expressing support for and solidarity with Palestine online, especially on Twitter.This is among the findings of an analysis by The Star which tracked the popularity of pro-Palestine hashtags among users of the social networking service.Social media monitoring software was used to search for 92 chosen keywords including popular hashtags and phrases that express support for and solidarity with Palestinians or which condemn Israel over its attacks.Most of the keywords were in English, and the majority of the social media posts tracked were on Twitter.The search found 31.26 million mentions by social media users from 193 countries over a one-month period from April 19 to May 19.Of the total, 1.18 million mentions came from Malaysians, making us the second most prolific, behind US-based social media users with 1.24 million mentions.Social media users in Pakistan came in third with 979,175 mentions, followed by people in Egypt (926,593) and India (858,704).Among the most popular hashtags mentioned or retweeted by Malaysians were #freepalestine, #savepalestine, #savesheikhjarrah, #gazaunderattack, #Israelterrorist and #Israelkoyak.Twenty-nine-year-old Syahmi Nazir, who has also been actively supporting Palestine on Twitter, expressed hope that it would help lead to action.Syahmi, who is known as @syahminamon on Twitter, posts five to seven tweets an hour on the issue in his free time, racking up a total 1,874 mentions on the topic since April 19.The 29-year-old entrepreneur who lives in Subang Jaya, Selangor, felt many people still lack an understanding of the extent of suffering in Palestine.\"We need to keep applying pressure and raise awareness until the people in power give Palestinians the basic rights they deserve, and uphold justice.”Student Nurul Aina Zulkarnaen from Terengganu said she spends her free time during the movement control order spreading awareness on the situation in Palestine in the hope that it might bring about positive change.Using the Twitter handle @callmeeyna, the 20-year-old has 1,041 pro-Palestine posts and hashtag retweets over the past month.\"I wish that the Palestinians will get freedom like what we have.“Their children have the right to a bright future and a peaceful life,” she said.Student Farah Aleeysha, who goes by @borahaedef7 on Twitter, said she retweets and posts 200 messages a day to show her support for Palestine, which she says is a sacred land for Muslims.\"Israel is showing its true colours but only a few countries are brave enough to stand up to it.\"By using my voice collectively with others, I can help create awareness on the atrocities and cruelty committed by Israel, and social media is helping us to achieve that,” said the 19-year-old.\n",

      "Suffering In SilenceHow the Pandemic is Affecting the Mental Health of Our ChildrenBY DIYANA PFORDTENNadia, a Form Five student, is the eldest among three siblings.Nadia is a composite character.She is drawn from descriptions by psychiatrists interviewed for this story, who were asked about the children – some as young as eight years old – in need of their help ever since the pandemic started.Adults are not the only people whose lives have been turned upside down by Covid-19.Children are also facing greater anxiety, depression and isolation due to school closures and sudden changes in their daily routines and interactions.Many are unable to cope but don’t know what to do and parents sometimes fail to notice that their children need help.The pandemic’s toll on the mental health of our school going children is a growing problem that parents and everyone in society need to pay more attention to, warn the experts.SOLS Health research and advocacy director Dr Arman Rashid said some of the mental health stressors experienced by children – exam stress, isolation from friends, anxiety about the future - are not unique to the pandemic but are escalated by it.SOLS Health research and advocacy director Dr Arman RashidDr Arman highlighted that the closure of schools means the lack of avenue for children to develop their socio-emotional needs besides fulfilling educational purposes.“Schools serve as an important support system for students with teachers and peers playing a role in their emotional wellbeing.“This important role of schools in the life of children was hampered during the pandemic. As a result, many children feel increasingly lonely, isolated and detached,” he said.Dr Arman pointed out the pandemic has also escalated uncertainty over future educational and employment plans, particularly for older students.“Generally speaking, all children have been affected by the pandemic but even more so for SPM/STPM students and those from B40 (bottom 40%) households,” he said, adding that burnout, exhaustion and anxiety over needing to perform well in exams escalated as students felt inadequately prepared.“The stress is higher for students from B40 families as many cannot get internet access, laptops or mobile devices for online classes, or access to devices. Many are also part of larger class sizes in school,” he said.Dr Arman highlighted that there are long-term implications of the pandemic for both mental health and education of students.“If students continue to face mental health stressors during this period, it can cause short-term and long-term problems in psychosocial functioning and day to day life, including academic performance, relationships, morale and others.“Though all children have been affected by the pandemic, coping is dependent on their own level of resilience and support system around them,” he said.Universiti Malaya Specialist Centre consultant psychiatrist Assoc Prof Dr Amer Siddiq Amer Nordin said he has been receiving a rising number of children between the age of eight to 12 years old who are in need of mental health support since the second movement control order.“Due to the pandemic, these children are learning online and parents who previously had control in terms of gadget time, now have very little control as it is the mandatory way of learning.“Kids are being exposed to higher degree of online time and we know that online time is a risk factor for online issues such as cyberbully,” he said.Universiti Malaya Specialist Centre consultant psychiatrist Assoc Prof Dr Amer Siddiq Amer NordinDr Amer noted that children, who lack understanding of the implication of their action, may resort to writing nasty things, photoshopping or calling names.“Because they were not taught on how to manage social media and have little understanding on how to regulate their emotions, these actions lead them to face emotional issues, mainly stress which then develops into depress mode.“Those without a support system will keep their problems to themselves to the extent that some develop depression and even harm themselves,” he said.Dr Amer highlighted that these children may display physical symptoms such as eating disorder, poor emotional control, deterioration in school performance or showing risk of self-harm.“To address this, parents need to teach their children what emotions are, name them and also validate them,” he said.Parents, added Dr Amer, need to bring their children for professional help if symptoms deteriorate as professional mental assessments can also reveal the child’s condition aggravated due to history of trauma, having divorced parents, medical comorbidities or drug or porn addiction.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), mental health conditions account for 16% of the global burden of disease and injury in people aged 10 to 19 years.“Half of all mental health conditions start by 14 years of age but most cases are undetected and untreated,” it said, adding that globally, depression is one of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents.WHO noted that the consequences of not addressing mental health and psychosocial development for children and adolescents extend to adulthood and limit opportunities for leading fulfilling lives.In Malaysia, the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2019 found that 424,000 children in the country were experiencing mental health problems.Dr Arman, who is also the former project manager of Humankind Buddy Bear, stressed on the need for children to have access to both formal and informal mental health support during the pandemic, including emotional support from teachers, parents and peers.“We must adopt a preventive approach, with parents and caregivers playing an important role in addressing emotional challenges faced by students.“Parents can help foster a supportive and positive environment for emotional expression and help-seeking at home.\"This involves listening and acknowledging feelings of children beyond meeting their physical needs,” he said.Parents and caregivers, said Dr Arman, are best placed to see early warning signs of mental health stressors, including connecting with mental health professionals if there is persistent distress.He also stressed that children also need more proactive involvement and supervision during online learning.“Emotional check-ins with children are very important. Parents need to look out for early warning signs like difficulties in concentration, frequent headaches, fatigue, irritability or sleep disruptions to offer emotional support.“If there are early responses, we can avoid mental health challenges from escalating into long-term conditions in most cases,” he said.If emotional distress persists and children show signs of intense hopelessness, social withdrawal, being overwhelmed, self-harm tendencies or thoughts despite support from parents or caregivers, Dr Arman encouraged parents to seek professional help.Acknowledging the shortage of mental health professionals, especially those specializing in supporting children, he said community stakeholders - parents, teachers, caregivers, social workers and others – need to be equipped with mental health skills and tools.“This has to go beyond general awareness to provide emotional support, assess needs and refer to formal resources if needed. In most cases, early interventions can prevent mental health conditions in the future.\"In the case of counselling, Dr Arman said there needs to be more of a focus on child-centred creative, expressive and play therapies in professional help, in addition to online support like Malaysia’s only child-dedicated helpline during the Covid-19 crisis, Buddy Bear, in helping children handle emotions and coping skills.“This is because children communicate differently than adults. This means we need to provide a range of services catering to children - psychosocial helplines, online platforms, peer support groups and professional help from counsellors and psychologists.“The bottom line is we need more mental health professionals specialising in supporting children,” he said, adding that inclusive access to mental health services is even more important for the B40 group and rural communities.According to data from 2018, there were 410 psychiatrists in our country with a national average of 1.27 psychiatrists per 100,000 population, which is much lower than the WHO's recommended ratio of one psychiatrist per 10,000 population.Dr Arman noted that SOLS Health-Thrive Well has an ongoing programme called Keluarga Akrab Mencapai Impian (KAMI)m which work with PPR communities to engage children and parents at the community level in preventing escalation of mental health challenges, improving relationships and developing emotional resilience.“SOLS Health-Thrive Well, with the support of Yayasan Hasanah and Ministry of Finance, is also offering the Jom Sembang project providing subsidised mental health care, particularly for B40 communities, including children,” he said.An English teacher at a school in Jerantut, who only wanted to be known as Farhan, said students, especially SPM candidates in the school he teaches in, were having a hard time coping with online learning due to poor internet connectivity.“We could only conduct lessons via WhatsApp where I would send pictures and voice note to explain the lesson.“Even then, only a few students would respond to the lessons and out of 20 children, only around four students would participate in the lessons and they are usually the same person,” he said.Farhan also said the students reported facing a lack of motivation, were preoccupied with housework or caring for their younger siblings, as well as a lack of supervision from parents.“When they return to physical classes, we will need to teach them from scratch. It was particularly challenging for SPM candidates who needed to catch up.“The higher-ups often push teachers to use Google Meet and advanced online learning tools but often neglect the accessibility of students in rural areas.“The fact is, there are many children who are left behind in their studies, face difficulties in online learning, as well as stress and isolation during the pandemic and this will definitely affect their future plans and to an extent,their emotional and mental health” he said.Those in need of help can contact Befrienders at befrienders.org.my/centre-in-malaysia or call 03-7627 2929; Talian Kasih at 15999 (24 hours); and Lifeline (Mandarin) at 03-4265 7995.Story: Diyana PfordtenIllustrations: Foo Chern HwanEditing: Razak AhmadVisualisation: Sim Leoi LeoiTOPBuilt with Shorthand\n",

      "TOUGH times call for strong characters, especially if you are a teacher trying to educate students living in hard-to-reach areas during a pandemic.Though schools had to close when the movement control order (MCO) began, education was not brought to a halt.It is easy for a teacher to teach when the conditions are ideal - the classroom is comfortable, there are enough tables and chairs, every student has a book, stationery and can they see the board clearly.But in rural schools, more often than not, the situation is far from ideal. Little, if at all, is readily available.The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) secretary-general Harry Tan said it was passion and responsibility that drove these teachers to do everything within their power to carry out their duty.With the closure of schools, teachers had to get creative and find novel ways to deliver their lesson modules to their students, he told The Star.Some of those who taught in the interiors would travel by jeep, boat and foot to reach their students at their homes to give modules and learning packs.Others would brave bad weather to personally hand deliver assignments to their charges.Click on the icon on the pictures below to view each teacher's storyEven though these were not as effective to teach compared to face-to-face learning, these teachers believed that this would be enough to keep the students from missing out.Sabah Teachers' Union (STU Sabah) vice-president Susan Atau said online learning was a “huge challenge” for her and her rural students last year.She said her students did not have any digital devices and, coupled with an “extremely hopeless” Internet connection, she could not finish the syllabus in time.To help those without any means of learning virtually, Susan printed notes and modules that was distributed to her students.“Tender loving care is what drives me and all other teachers to do this for our students, ” she added.Educationist Datuk N. Siva Subramaniam said these teachers deserved to be honoured for the great lengths they went through.“While we recognise the sacrifices and contribution of these teachers, we must never forget that they too have families to take care of, ” added the former NUTP secretary-general, Cuepacs president and human rights commissioner.He said the nation owes its development to the dedication of these teachers who would be based in schools miles away from their families.Some, he added, would even be placed in schools without basic amenities.Based on data from the Education Ministry, there are 671 schools located in rural areas in Malaysia. The majority being in Sabah (285) and Sarawak (330).This is out of more than 10,000 schools in the country.Unsurprisingly there are no rural schools in the federal territories - Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan.Though nothing much can be done about the locality of these schools, there is concern that the students here are once again going to be badly affected when home-based teaching and learning (PdPR) makes a comeback after the Hari Raya holidays.“I think that urban schools would be fine conducting PdPR but the rural schools will have problems, ” said Subramaniam.However, he pointed out that all teachers faced problems implementing PdPR as they were not trained to teach in that manner.He added that the government should quickly provide proper laptops and a mobile data plan to these teachers to enable them to conduct, not just PdPR, but also prepare modules to be sent to their students again.Universiti Utara Malaysia School of Education senior lecturer Dr Muhammad Noor Abdul Aziz said teachers are struggling to make learning happen for their charges.\"Given that Malaysian learners are divided into two categories - urban and rural – issues like Internet connection, possession of gadgets, and continuous learning support seem to be a major hindrance among learners in rural areas while their counterparts in the urban area are burdened with homework.\"Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The employment disparity between young men and women in the country is alarming.More young Malaysian women are eager to join the workforce, have clearer career goals, and are more academically qualified, but they face higher unemployment rates.This worrying trend was identified in a study by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute titled “Unemployment among Malaysia’s Youth: Structural Trends and Current Challenges”, authored by its senior fellow and Malaysia Studies Programme co-coordinator Lee Hwok Aun.The paper, which was published on June 18,2020, addresses several factors affecting youth unemployment, and substantial gender disparity was one of them.While diverse reasons affect employment opportunities among young Malaysian women, various bodies and non-governmental organisations say marriage-related reasons and cultural aspects play a vital role.Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) executive director Shamsuddin Bardan said some women stop working after marriage.They cite reasons that include family responsibilities, such as having to look after their children and aged parents, he added.“Even after their children no longer require their mother to look after them or their parents have passed on, some women still choose not to rejoin the job market.“This is unlike Japan and South Korea, where women who stopped working due to similar reasons rejoin the workforce once their family-related responsibilities are reduced.“Despite the government’s incentive of tax exemptions for women returning to work after a career break, the take-up rate is low, ” he said.Creating a gender-diverse and inclusive workplace, Shamsuddin added, is a leadership matter.It must be a key component in employers’ policies and mission statements, as well as being demonstrated through actions.Gender biases must be managed through open dialogues and workplace campaigns as well, he said.“Women undoubtedly face more biases from both men and women themselves, explicitly and implicitly.“Unconscious bias is a result of ingrained cultural conditioning where women are not considered as valuable to the workforce, and they are seen as not very committed to the job or the organisation because of family responsibilities and conflicts.“Women might not be as forthcoming in expressing their discontent and their expectations from the employers as they are socially conditioned to undervalue themselves, ” he added.Moving forward, Shamsuddin said the female participation rate in the workforce could be pushed to higher rates, reaching beyond 60% of the LFP (labour force participation).Flexible working hours and work arrangements, work-life balance policies, and remote working are among the policies that could be implemented to encourage more women to work.“The private sector must embrace family-friendly policies and gender diversity in their workforce to boost women’s participation rate.“Employers who actively encourage, nurture and foster women in leadership roles also encourage more women into their workforce, ” he said.All Women's Action Society (Awam) information and communications officer Tan Chia Ee said the trend showing greater progress in closing the gender gap in educational attainment but less in economic participation is a global phenomenon.Occupational segregation could also explain the gender gap in economic participation, she added.“Women tend to concentrate in sectors such as retail, hospitality and care work while being underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), both in universities and in the job market.“This is due to not only longstanding stereotypes surrounding women’s suitability in STEM careers but also having few role models and access to academic support that can boost their interest, motivation and confidence in entering STEM.“Labour market disruption due to Covid-19 exacerbates the gender gap in employment, as women are retrenched due to the destruction of sectors where they predominate, while female talent influx and/or rate of transitioning into STEM remains low, ” she said, adding that women still encounter substantial structural barriers to more productive employment.Women still face strong conventional societal expectations to be homemakers and caregivers, while men are still expected to be family breadwinners.This social norm, she said, can shape biases surrounding women’s suitability for work.In a survey conducted on Malaysian women, Tan said 47% of the 1,010 respondents were asked about their marital status during a job interview, 22% were asked about their ability to perform certain tasks as a woman, 15% were asked about their plans to have children, and 13% were asked if they would require a long maternity leave if they got pregnant.Such questions constitute gender-based discrimination and can directly affect employment outcomes, she stressed.To enable gender parity in employment, she said changes in pre-existing unequal gender power are necessary and the public must play its part.This could be achieved through a multi-pronged strategy involving education, awareness-raising and incentives.Solutions, too, must be viewed from a public policy angle and public awareness on gender equality needs to be increased.“The media also has a role to play in challenging social norms that perpetuate gender inequality.“By promoting sexist perceptions and interpretations, the media can reinforce existing patriarchal power relations, not only making it more difficult to challenge the gender inequality status quo, but also making physical and online spaces less safe for women.“By challenging patriarchal and actively shaping gender-equal public narratives in everyday media, substantial differences can be made in terms of creating a culture that supports gender equality, ” added Tan.Universiti Sains Malaysia Centre for Research on Women and Gender director Prof Dr Noraida Endut has 25 years of experience researching gender issues.The trend according to the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute study, she said, is not necessarily more alarming than before, but she described it as frustrating.“There is a lack of progress and even with progress, it is incremental and takes so much time.“In Malaysia, the LFP rate for women has always been low compared to men.“Only in the last five years or so has the overall LFP surpassed 50%, ” she explained.A study commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme in 2013, she said, showed that the four main reasons women don’t work or stop working include looking after their children, leaving after getting married, leaving upon their husband’s request, and supporting their husband's career growth.“Among the women who have worked before and are now unemployed, about 57% said they want to work but had to stop for various reasons and among the women who have never worked before, 43% said they would like to work.“Therefore, we can see that women end up not working because they had to give up their careers or had to give up seeking employment to fulfil their expected roles as mothers and wives... it's because they are women, ” she said.Prof Noraida stressed that there must be clear policies at workplaces to facilitate a balance between work and family.This would allow for improved gender division of labour at home and at work, allowing more women to return to their workplaces.“These policies include maternity protection that extends to both pre- and post-natal periods where women are given temporary reliefs from some work during their pregnancy, ” she said.In addition, there should also be measures that could include special parking for pregnant women, flexible work arrangements, and an ability to take time off to go for check-ups without sacrificing annual leave.Other moves could include providing safe and accessible lactation rooms, time off to use lactation rooms, and time off to look after sick children for both female and male employees.“A gender equality policy is also important to ensure the organisation observes and develops a gender-equal and non-discriminatory practice.“This includes, for example, prohibiting the practice of asking female candidates about her ability to execute her duties if she is a mother or about her potentially getting pregnant, ” added Prof Noraida.A sexual harassment policy and mechanism is also important because sexual harassment, she said, is a form of gender-based violence that hinders women’s access and opportunity to enjoy their rights at work.“It often causes women to be unfairly treated in their promotion or to be constructively dismissed.”Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities Centre for Research in Media and Communication Assoc Prof Dr Jamaluddin Aziz said the way forward is to depoliticise employment.He said the government, too, should step in to continue providing support systems that would facilitate women empowerment.Women empowerment projects, he said, must be carried out by the right groups and their efficiency must be tested and proven.“There are many factors that contribute to this trend.“Usually, these factors are when economic opportunities, level of literacy and cultural practices intersect with gender.“Therefore, gender is a valid lens from which this trend can be interpreted.“For instance, although a reasonable number of economic opportunities for women have been provided by the government, cultural practices, political interference, and level of literacy may hinder their participation, ” he explained.He said in some instances, although financial aid is given specifically to women to help with their businesses, some register for the benefit of their husbands.There are also those who register their businesses under their husbands’ names.“These are examples of issues at the operational level, while it is the fundamental levels that need more attention – such as the gender structure in our culture as it is often manifested in the way we assign value to men and women, and boys and girls.”Malaysia must move from this mentality and approach, he stressed.Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Countries around the world are exploring ways to show proof of an individual's Covid-19 immunity in order to allow travel and other easing of social restrictions.Several countries have initiated travel passports, which are Covid-19 vaccine certificates or any physical or digital document that would prove you've received both doses (or one dose for certain vaccines) of any of the available Covid-19 vaccines.In some countries, vaccine certificates can also be issued to those who have recently tested negative for Covid-19 or have built immunity against it after having been infected.All this would allow citizens to travel among participating countries or be granted exemptions to certain Covid-19 restrictions in their own country.A recent survey by market research firm Ipsos shows that more than three-quarters of adults surveyed (78%) across 28 countries agree that Covid-19 vaccine passports should be required of travellers entering their country.In comparison to the size of the majority in other countries polled, Malaysians were largely more supportive of having vaccine passports or similar health certificates in order to allow travellers to enter the country (92%).The survey was conducted from March 26 to April 9 with adults from the age of 16 to 75 in 28 countries.The findings show that Malaysians were also highly optimistic that vaccine passports will be widely used by the end of the year.\"They strongly believe that this will make travel and large events safe.\"Japan, host country of 2021 Olympics, and the United States, which has rolled out a vaccination programme efficiently, are not as optimistic as Malaysia,\" Ipsos said in a statement.Its managing director Arun Menon noted that countries across the world are progressing through their vaccination phases, but some are still facing larger surges or second or third waves of the pandemic.\"The Malaysian public widely supports the requirement of vaccine certificates to enter the country and access large venues.\"As we cross a year of living with Covid-19, the Malaysian public is looking for ways in which they can get back to normal, even if that requires carrying or mandating vaccine passports or similar health certificates,\" he said.Travel industry players are also hopeful that travel passports will help revive their battered industry.Travel passports or proof of vaccination can be in the form of a physical card, a piece of paper with a QR code, or most often, a mobile app.However, there is still no clear universal standard for vaccine certificates for all countries.The World Health Organisation has also outlined considerations regarding immunity passports due to the shortage of or unequal access to vaccines in many countries.Health experts in Malaysia advise caution on introducing travel passports too soon amid concerns of new Covid-19 variants emerging, vaccine effectiveness and the feasibility as well as fairness of establishing such a system.Despite that, many countries have already started initiating travel bubbles and vaccine passports among other selected countries.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised against travelling to certain parts of the world, and the US State Department's travel advisory outlines the level of Covid-19 risks in countries based on the spread of the Covid-19 virus and number of cases.Only 30 destinations in the world are classified under Level 1 in the travel advisory, which indicates a low risk of Covid-19. These include countries like Brunei, China, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand and Laos.CDC guidelines also noted that once fully vaccinated – defined as two weeks after taking the final dose – it is safe to meet indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks or keeping a distance.Some countries have also used vaccine certificates to return to some measure of normalcy with regard to social activities, such as allowing those with Covid-19 immunity to access mass gatherings, indoor venues and events -- such as stadiums, swimming pools, restaurants, gyms, theatres, concerts, hotels and also pilgrimage sites.However, the CDC guidelines advised those going to medium and large gatherings to take precautions by practising physical distancing and wearing a mask regardless of attendees' vaccination status.The Malaysian government suggested in early April that individuals who have completed two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine may be allowed to travel interstate or even abroad, as well as be exempted from certain Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SOPs).To date, no official decision has been made.The country is still in negotiations with international parties including Asean countries and the European Union on the need for a mutually recognised vaccine passport to resume travel among the partner states.\n",

He had to think fast.For safety, he decided to shoot from inside his car. He drove to a spot across the Prime Minister’s office complex and rolled down the window.He chose a wide angle 17-35mm lens as he didn’t know where exactly the lightning would strike.A lightning streak occurs in a fraction of a second, so he adjusted his Canon Mark 111 camera shutter speed to a high setting of 1/1250 sec and waited.And then it happened.There was a flash of light. He pressed the shutter button, capturing a machine gun rapid eight frames per second.Of the dozen frames he took; the lightning was present in four.He felt disappointed but decided to pack up and leave, rather than stay longer and raise the risk of getting struck.Checking his images after he got home, he realised he had done it.One of the four shots showed a perfect lightning strike on the dome of the Perdana Putra building.Photographer Raja Faisal explaining step by step how he captured the lightning videoPlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time04:34Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenThe photo made the front page of The Star on April 30 that year.The image won him first prize at the 2006 Malaysian Press Institute Award in the Media Photo News, beating over 61 other entries.It also won earned him the Silver Award in the Spot News category of the Asia Media Awards 2006 organised by Ifra, the world’s leading association for newspaper and media publishing.The awards were open to media organisations throughout Asia, with Raja Faisal the first winner from Malaysia.Raja Faisal winning the Silver Award during the Asia Media Awards 2006While photographing a fleeting flash of lightning is challenging, lightning itself is no stranger to many parts of Malaysia.The Klang Valley reportedly has the third highest number of lightning strikes in the world.Last year, the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang had a whopping 341 days with lightning.It was the highest for 2020 based on records of the Malaysian Meteorological Department’s 42 main meteorological stations.Subang meanwhile holds the record for the area with the highest ever number of days with lightning ever recorded.According to MetMalaysia’s figures, there were 362 days with lightning in Subang in 1987.Put another way, there were only three days in 1987 when the highly urbanised city in Selangor’s Petaling district did not see lightning.PlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time01:16Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenAccording to MetMalaysia, the highest amount of lightning is seen during the country’s inter-monsoon periods between April to May and October.Lightning is also frequent between June and September during the south-west monsoon.The north-east monsoon from December to March however sees relatively fewer incidences of lightning.Story: Razak AhmadPhotograph: Raja Faisal HishanAnimation: Nor Shalina Abdul Samad and Shaiful Rizwan Mohd AzharVisualisation: Sim Leoi LeoiTOPBuilt with Shorthand\n",

      "Myanmar at a Crossroadsby MAZWIN NIK ANIS and JOSEPH KAOS, JRAP PhotoWHEN the 10 members of Asean meet for a special summit in Jakarta today, the most urgent and immediate task at hand is to resolve the political crisis in Myanmar, which has so far seen over 700 people killed in protests across the country.The fact that the summit, the first physical meeting amidst a pandemic, is taking place speaks volume of the urgent matter at hand and will see the attendance of heads of government, except for Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan o-cha who has confirmed that he will be skipping the meet.Thailand will instead be represented by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai.If the head of Myanmar’s military government, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, does indeed show up for the meet, this will be his first known foreign trip since the junta's coup on Feb 1.Protesters pour water in an attempt to diminish the effects of tear gas during a crackdown by security forces on a demonstration against the military coup in Yangon's Thaketa township on March 19, 2021. (Photo by STR / AFP)The Asean leaders' meeting in Jakarta, which was called by Indonesia, will be chaired by Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah as the 2021 Asean chair.Also present will be Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.Muhyiddin, said Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein, had received a special invitation letter from Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah to attend the meet on April 17.“The Prime Minister has formally responded to the letter on April 19 that he will be attending the meeting,\" he told reporters during a buka puasa event at Wisma Putra on April 20.On Feb 5, Muhyiddin and Indonesian president Joko “Jokowi” Widodo had said that they were seeking a special meeting of the South-East Asian nations to discuss the situation in Myanmar.Singapore is also in support of the proposal.During the summit, coincidentally, Min is expected to sit next to Muhyiddin.As the country harbouring a large number of refugees from Myanmar - Rohingya from the conflict-ridden Rakhine State, as well as those of the Chin ethnic group, among others - Malaysia is certainly keen to see the current political crisis resolved as peacefully and as quickly as possible.This is particularly so when there is now a real fear of Myanmar turning into another \"Syria\", a country wracked by civil war since 2011.  \"There are clear echoes of Syria in 2011,\" United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has warned on April 14.On Sept 26 last year, as Malaysia grapples with the economic spillover from the Covid-19 pandemic, Muhyiddin has told the United Nations that as a developing nation coping with the cost of managing and providing protection to nearly 180,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers in the country - 86% of them from Myanmar - its resources are being stretched thin.Read more: Find moral courage, political will to do what's right, Muhyiddin tells UNPrime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. - BernamaMalaysia and Asean members will surely not want the present conflict in Myanmar to worsen and result in an even worse flood of refugees.Thailand, Myanmar's neighbour on the south, is already having to face some 2,000 refugees from the ethnic Karen minority massing along its border following air strikes by the junta.Myanmar, the largest country on mainland south-east asia with a population of 54 million people comprising 135 recognised ethnic groups, has long been engrossed in ethnic strife and is engaged in ongoing civil wars with various armed factions within the country, such as the Shan state army near the Thai border.Read more: Worried about Myanmar’s futureA Myanmar national in Malaysia, Than Phe Lay, says they will make their feelings heard via online protests.It was only recently - before the Feb 1 coup - that the country has seen relative peace under some semblance of democratic rule and trade with its neighbours flourish.But the killing of protesters in street demonstrations by the military junta has led to some ethnic armed factions vowing not to stand by and do nothing should this continue.Malaysia, said Hishammuddin, remains firm in its stance that the violence in Myanmar must end and that political detainees must be released immediately.  “We will reiterate Malaysia’s stance on the Myanmar situation in which the violence in the country must cease immediately.“Secondly, all political leaders in Myanmar must be released immediately.Read more: Malaysia calls for Suu Kyi’s releaseForeign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein. - MOHD SAHAR“Thirdly, Myanmar must agree to receive representatives from the Asean chair, which is Brunei, or from the Asean secretariat to help the country return to normalcy,” he stressed.From the three-finger salute, an inspiration from the dystopian novel Hunger Games, to painted Easter eggs, graffiti, and popular memes, the people in Myanmar are taking their fight for democracy to the Internet.The Internet has become as important - and certainly less risky- a frontline as the streets for protesters in the country.Brought on up a diet of social media feed, this Internet-savvy generation of protesters are making sure that when they do turn up for their rallies, they are colourful, unusual and Instagram-worthy to catch the world's spotlight and make sure that their fight is not forgotten.And despite the shutdown of Internet access by the military, they are making sure to flood social media with memes, ranging from Pepe the Frog to NFSW mottoess, mostly in English.This photo taken and received courtesy of an anonymous source on April 8, 2021, shows shoes being displayed with flowers in Mandalay, as part of the \"Marching Shoes Strike\" called on social media.

(AP Photo)Malaysia, the Foreign Minister has reiterated, will not be wavering from its stand.Besides the concern of more refugees as well as the occasional rallies against the treatment of Rohingya by the junta, Malaysia has generally enjoyed good relations with Myanmar in trade and tourism, with robust air links between Kuala Lumpur and cities like Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyidaw before Covid-19 put paid to flights.Demonstrators with tape on their mouths holding posters during a peaceful rally \"Silent Protest: In Solidarity With The People Of Rohingya\" by Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia at Dataran Merdeka in December 2018. RAYMOND OOI/ The StarIn fact, while many Western countries sought to levy sanctions and condemn Myanmar during Aung Sang Suu Kyi's house arrest in the 1990s and early 2000s, Malaysia has worked, through diplomatic overtures via Asean, for her eventual release, which subsequently, ushered in democratic rule in Myanmar.Aung Sang Suu Kyi is now back under house arrest and facing various charges, including corruption, while other senior leaders of the National League of Democracy (NLD), which won overwhelmingly in a general election declared void by the junta, are in detention and have their offices ransacked.The democratic progress of the recent past years is now in danger of coming undone.

      "FOR all aspiring photographers, OPPO has partnered with National Geographic – yes, the NatGeo – to host the 2121 Malaysia Future Photography contest.To ensure the colours of today endure till the year 2121, NatGeo photographer Joel Sartore favours the OPPO Find X3 Pro to capture endangered species in all their gorgeous hues.This partnership between OPPO and NatGeo – long known for its storytelling prowess through imagery – is to raise awareness through conservation photography.Sartore has spent decades wielding his camera to conserve natural spaces and the habitats they support. His believes that great photographs, and the stories behind them, have the power to save species and the habitats they need to survive.“So, I hope these images ‘go to work’, both today and a hundred years from now, to inspire everyone to care about the planet, ” he said.OPPO invites you to memorialise one thing that you would like to see preserved until 2121 – be it nature’s gems, unbroken landscapes, or even your favourite person on this Blue Marble.OPPO has three trade secrets to share that will help you capture the essence of humanity in your shots even while you stay indoors:Colour composition and lightingWe have all had a moment when our photo turns out overexposed because of the camera’s autofocus. The best way to give your photos that detailed and high-contrast look is by using natural light. Sunlight gives you the chance to play around with shadows and highlights without needing to fuss over colour correction.The OPPO Find X3 Pro is also equipped with AI Highlight Video that automatically switches between Ultra-Night Video and Live HDR, allowing you to capture true-to-life colours without worrying about low-light or overexposure.Not to mention the Find X3 Pro is capable of 10-bit colour which is ground-breaking in itself ensuring absolute and real colours, making the Find X3 Pro a convenient tool for professional photography.Use the ‘rule of thirds’Don’t worry, this isn’t as complicated as it sounds. Simply put, this just means that when the subject of your photo is framed in the intersections of your composition, it will turn out more visually appealing than the traditionally centred shot.With the Find X3 Pro world first’s 50MP ultra wide-angle, you can capture even more details in a single instance, allowing more flexibility with your shots with zero distortion. You can use this to your advantage by using different perspectives to make your photos unique.Shoot many, keep a fewLastly, be prepared to take a lot of photos. Some of the best results come from candid moments when your model may be laughing or smiling. Those are the photos that bring out the humanity in mundane moments.Capturing their gaze can really add life to the overall photo and allow the subjects to tell their own story through the shot.Preserve today, for tomorrow, in your photos. If you want to be in the running to win attractive prizes, be sure to only use the hashtag #TheStarXOPPO when you enter the competition.Interested to learn more about FindX3 Pro? You can visit OPPO’s website or its webstore on Shopee or Lazada.For more information on the contest, visit https://oppomy.com/2121MalaysiaFuturePhotographyContest/tc/ or click here for contest mechanics.\n",

      "GA Malaysia equips individuals with in-demand digital skillsABOUT a quarter of all Malaysian jobs are expected to be displaced by 2030 due to digitalisation.The pandemic has accelerated the pace of change. Even as overall unemployment rises, the number of digital job vacancies has tripled in the past year, according to the Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC).Few careers will be left untouched by the rising demand for digital skill sets such as data science, digital marketing, product management, user experience design and more.Forward-looking professionals are racing to adapt by investing in digital skills development to remain relevant and continue progressing in their careers.Getting aheadGeneral Assembly (GA), a global pioneer in skills and career transformation, specialises in equipping individuals with today’s most in-demand skills.More than 100,000 GA graduates are employed at 19,000 organisations globally. GA is the number one provider of digital upskilling bootcamps in the United States.According to GA Malaysia CEO Andrew Pereira, professionals are looking for practical digital skills development with credentials that will advance their careers.“They want to learn immediately applicable skills from experts and earn a globally recognised qualification in the process, without an excessive time commitment,” he says.However, many only turn their mind to upskilling or reskilling when they are out of a job or unable to move up the corporate ladder.“Most skills have a shelf life. You need to be constantly restocking with fresh skills or you may find that the ones you have are outdated,” says Pereira.Many of today’s most in-demand skills such as Python (a coding language commonly used in data science) and data visualisation are not even widely recognised.“The business world is moving beyond just spreadsheets and slides. We are there to help professionals discover and develop skills to help them get ahead,” he says.Securing a jobThis need is even more pronounced among recent graduates and early career professionals. They have been disproportionately impacted by today’s tighter labour market as evidenced by the high graduate unemployment rate.“A lot of university graduates turn to us several months into their job search because they discover that their degrees and skill sets don’t match what employers are looking for,” says Pereira.“We have helped many change careers entirely – for instance, helping arts graduates secure data analyst or digital marketing roles.”According to GA’s most recent audited Student Outcomes Report, 91% of GA’s reskilling students secure a position in their new digital field within 180 days of graduation. That figure rises to over 99% after 180 days.Pereira attributes this success to the high quality of instruction and career coaching that GA provides.“We accept fewer than 10% of applicants for instructor roles and practice project-based learning.”MySTEP to learn digital skillsGeneral Assembly is partnering with Khazanah Nasional to deliver the MySTEP programme 2021 to support unemployed Malaysians.The four-month programme upskills learners in in-demand digital skills, offers globally-recognised certification, develops learners’ professional skills, and matches learners with career opportunities.Learners also earn RM 2,000 per month during the programme, so that they can focus on learning digital skills, developing professional skills, and on securing job opportunities in digital areas such as software engineering, data analytics, digital marketing and more.While joining the MySTEP programme 2021 is free, seats are limited and over 2,000 have applied for the programme within its first month. Applications for the programme can be made online by July 12.For more information on the programme, visit the website.\n",

      "UNDERSTANDABLY, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, parents are concerned about increased health and safety risks when sending their children overseas to further their education.According to the Higher Education Ministry’s statistics, 73,000 Malaysian students were studying abroad in 2019, with the majority seeking their education in the United Kingdom and Ireland (26.4%). But the numbers dropped significantly to 39,882 in 2020.However, there may be a workaround that might prove beneficial so that students can benefit from an international education, while staying safe on home ground.Those keen to pursue higher studies in the UK, in particular, can take a look at the international branch of the University of Reading, the University of Reading Malaysia (UoRM), which offers a number of flexible pathways and options.Ranked 75 in the world for international outlook in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020, the University of Reading boasts several world-renowned centres of academic excellence, including the Henley Business School, the School of Built Environment, the School of Law, as well as the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences.Flexible possibilitiesAt UoRM, students are able to start their studies locally and take advantage of its flexible mobility programme. This transfer option would allow students to complete their studies at the university’s UK campus in Reading, once international travel regulations are better hammered out.Furthermore, studying at the local campus proves to be more affordable, with the overall estimated cost costing 40% less than studying three years in the UK, taking into account university fees and living expenses.On top of that, students may be eligible to receive a merit-based High Achievers Scholarship worth up to 30% off their programme fees.The programmes at UoRM are identical to those on the UK campus, following the same curriculum and academic quality standards. Furthermore, UoRM’s state-of-the-art campus and digital learning suite will also provide students with excellent learning facilities and support.The local campus is located in EduCity Iskandar Johor - touted as Asia’s first multi-campus education city - and offers a number of signature degree programmes in the following disciplines:> Accounting> Finance> Management and business> Law> Psychology> Quantity surveying> Real estateWhen students do eventually make their way to the UK, they would be pleased to note that the university’s main campus in the UK is set in 130ha of beautiful parkland and has won the Green Flag award nine times in a row, making it one of the UK’s best green spaces. It is also equipped with sports facilities, eateries, a supermarket and on-campus accommodation.A bonus? The campus is just a short bus ride away from Reading town centre. With ample shops, restaurants and amenities, it happens to be a 22-minute train ride to London.Flexible commencementStudents with A-level, STPM, UEC or equivalent qualifications may apply for UoRM undergraduate degrees, while those with SPM or IGCSE qualifications may enrol in the 12-month International Foundation Programme.Upon successful progression, students may take on their undergraduate studies either in the Malaysian or UK campus. In the meantime, the local campus has three different commencement periods - April, July and September – to give students further flexibility.The faculty is also expanding and accepting new faculty members who might be interested in joining the local campus. For more details, visit here.For more information, visit here or click here for a virtual tour of the UK campus.

      "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's airlines and holiday companies are planning a \"day of action\" on Wednesday to ramp up pressure on the government to ease travel restrictions, with just weeks to go before the start of the peak summer season.Travel companies, whose finances have been stretched to breaking point during the pandemic, are desperate to avoid another summer lost to COVID-19. But with Britain's strict quarantine requirements still in place that now looks likely.As the clock ticks down to July, Europe's biggest airline Ryanair and Manchester Airports Group on Thursday launched legal action to try to get the government to ease the rules before the industry's most profitable season starts.On Wednesday, June 23, pilots, cabin crew and travel agents will gather in Westminster, central London, and at airports across Britain to try to drum up support.Britain's aviation industry has been harder hit by the pandemic than its European peers, according to data published by pilots trade union BALPA on Sunday.That showed daily arrivals and departures into the United Kingdom were down 73% on an average day earlier this month compared to before the pandemic, the biggest drop in Europe. Spain, Greece and France were down less than 60%.UK airports were also badly affected, with traffic in and out of London's second busiest airport Gatwick down 92%, according to the data.Time is running out for the industry, said the union.\"There is no time to hide behind task forces and reviews,\" said BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton.\"BALPA is demanding that the UK Government gets its act together and opens the U.S. routes and European holiday travel destinations that it has blocked with no published evidence at all.\"Over 45,000 jobs have already been lost in UK aviation, with estimates suggesting that 860,000 aviation, travel and tourism jobs are being sustained only by government furlough schemes.(Reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Mark Potter)\n",

Instead of writing the essay, he wrote just one sentence – that he wanted me to come home.“That one sentence broke my heart as I saw how much being away from each other had affected him,” he added.Another Malaysian father working in Singapore, Teow Yee Han, 30, is resigned to spending his first Father’s Day without his nine-month-old daughter, who was born in Kedah on Sept 20 last year.“My wife and I returned to our hometown about a month before our baby was due and stayed there until she was about five months old.“In February, we had to be back for work. It was not an easy decision to make but we had no choice.“We shed tears on our way back to Singapore,” he said, adding that their baby is in the care of his mother-in-law in Alor Setar.The warehouse store keeper said he and his wife video call his mother-in-law frequently to ask about their girl and catch a glimpse of her and hear her laughter.“We miss her dearly and yearn to hold her in our arms again but with the pandemic, it is difficult for us to be reunited anytime soon,” said Teow.For retired teacher Tan Keng Hock, 81, who has two children living in Singapore, one in Kuala Lumpur and another in Germany, being away from them does not stop him from being an important figure in their lives.“Although they are now adults in their 40s and 30s – one of them even has a child of his own – we still maintain a close relationship and talk to each other frequently,” he said.Last year, because of the pandemic, his children could not return to celebrate Father’s Day with him, like they used to do.“But they ordered a cake for me on Father’s Day.“Being able to video call them, especially on Father’s Day, helps to make me feel close to them,” he added.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: The Security Industry Association of Malaysia (PIKM) has called on the government to consider placing private security guards in the priority category for vaccination as soon as possible.Its president Datuk Seri Ramli Yusuff said there are 900 security companies licensed by the Home Ministry across the country that provide security guards to various industries and government agencies.\"More than 120,000 security guards work around the clock to ensure the safety of their clients, and this function obviously assists the police in managing the safety of society.\"Most of the guards belong to the 25 to 60 age group.\"The most-affected are Nepalese security guards, although the number is not large, who have contracted Covid-19 while on duty,\" he said on Sunday (June 20).Ramli said the association had written to the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme in February and appealed for priority vaccination for security guards.\"Following which, the Health Ministry informed us to advise our members and security guards to register individually through MySejahtera.\"We also wrote to Khairy Jamaluddin, the coordinating minister for the programme, on May 31 and we sincerely hope he will address our appeal. This appeal was also extended to the National Security Council,\" he added.While the number of guards who have been vaccinated could not be ascertained as members have been advised to register via MySejahtera, Ramli said based on feedback from association members, the bulk have not been vaccinated yet.Ramli said an estimated 70,000 guards are deployed at shopping malls, retail areas, banks, other commercial places and residential complexes throughout the country while 50,000 others man hospitals and schools and other government-linked agencies.\"Private security guards interact with the public closely as part of their job, making them vulnerable to infection.\"The guards are frontliners at all guarded premises and they are at high risk of being infected.\"They are tasked with ensuring all visitors or shoppers (including employees) go through temperature checks and registration,\" he added.Ramli added that the security sector was not categorised as one of the sectors under the International Trade and Industry Ministry's Public-Private Partnership Covid-19 Industry Immunisation Programme (Pikas).\n",

      "HAVANA (Reuters) -Cuba's Soberana 2 vaccine candidate has shown 62% efficacy with just two of its three doses, state-run biopharmaceutical corporation BioCubaFarma said on Saturday, citing preliminary data from late phase trials.Cuba, whose biotech sector https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-vaccine-cuba-focus-idUKKBN27S1OZ has exported vaccines for decades, has five vaccine candidates in clinical trials, of which two - Soberana 2 and Abdala - are in late phase trials.\"In a few weeks we should have the results for the efficacy with three doses which we expect will be superior,\" said Vicente Vérez, director of the state-run Finlay Vaccine Institute, which developed Soberana 2.The news comes as the Caribbean's largest island is facing its worst outbreak since the start of the pandemic in the wake of the arrival of more contagious variants, setting new records of daily coronavirus cases.The Communist-run country has opted not to import foreign vaccines but rather to rely on its own. Experts say it is a risky bet but if it pays off, Cuba could burnish its scientific reputation, generate much-needed hard currency through exports and strengthen the vaccination drive worldwide.\"We know our government has not been able to provide this project all the funding it required, and nonetheless this is a result of global standing,\" President Miguel Diaz-Canel said at the presentation of the results on state-run television.Several countries from Argentina and Jamaica to Mexico and Venezuela have expressed an interest in buying Cuba's vaccines.

      "KOTA KINABALU: When Catherine Dumas was growing up, all she knew of the world was the forest she was born in. Today, the Sabahan is a self-made millionaire running her own packaging business.It was deep in the forest of Tamparuli, some 50km from the state capital, that Dumas learnt the ways of the village, sourcing for food like fruits, vegetables and fish from her parents’ farm and the nearby river.She recalled walking to school for hours each day with her siblings because the family had no car and there were no roads there either during that time.“We had to leave at 4am to make it to school,” said the 41-year-old founder of the company Qpack.The seventh of eight siblings also remembered having to wear home clothes and slippers on their journey to school and change just before reaching school.“We had to walk through the forest, up and down hills, cross a river, and if we had worn our uniforms from home, we would be drenched in sweat and dirt,” she said.Although her family lived in a simple wooden house without electricity and tap water, Dumas said she was unaware of what poverty was back then.“I only realised it when I went to secondary school and lived in a hostel. My friends had pocket money to buy snacks and their parents arrived in cars during the weekends to visit,” she said.She rued the time when she felt embarrassed to see her parents coming to visit her on foot and bringing a little bit of what they had from home and some money from their sales at the weekly tamu (market).“I even told my mother to stop visiting and that she didn’t have to give me money because I was so embarrassed. What an ungrateful child I was!” she said.But the tough 14-year-old did not wallow in self-pity. Instead, she started working part-time during the weekends, pocketing between RM20 and RM30 weekly from cleaning her teachers’ houses to washing dishes in restaurants.“As I grew older, I realised how difficult it was for my parents to raise eight of us with just farming. I knew I had to study hard to transform our lives,” said Dumas, who eventually made it to university.After graduating, she worked with audit firms, among others, and did part-time door-to-door sales.“I struggled for about 10 years to make ends meet,” she said.It was only in 2018 that Dumas had an idea which led her to become a successful entrepreneur.“I saw how small-time traders, especially home businesses, packaged their goods, so I thought if I could help them improve their packaging then they might increase their sales,” she said.From there, Dumas gradually built her team and business to be what it is now – a RM15mil venture with a 25-strong workforce and many trainees and agents under her.“When the pandemic hit last year, we had to improvise fast and adapt to online marketing,” she said.The mother of three is now able to make life better for her parents by giving them a monthly allowance as well as helping her siblings whenever they need financial support.Her only regret is not being able to do so much earlier, and to bring happiness to her parents, especially her mother, now in her 80s, who is battling stage-four cancer.“I will do my best to make her happy,” said Dumas.\n",

      "IT’S tough taking care of children during the movement control order as a single parent.But for some single fathers in Malaysia, the increased time spent at home during the pandemic has made them feel closer to their kids.A single father, who wishes to be known only as Ahmad, 32, says his two-year-old son is what keeps him going each day, despite the challenging times.“Sometimes, I feel like my son is the one looking after me instead of the other way around.“He keeps me company at home, even while working and minds his own business.“He makes me laugh, ” says the business executive, who has picked up cooking skills by preparing more dishes during the MCO for his son.Ahmad has three other children, who are with their mother, but he has custody of his youngest child.“For me, the most challenging part in this pandemic is at night when my kid is asleep.“That’s when my world just becomes silent and lonely and I start missing my other kids, ” he shares.As a single father, Ahmad says he is also concerned about what should happen to his son if he falls sick.“Nobody can take care of my son if I am unwell. I normally bring him along if I have to go out, ” he admits.As for another single father, Tan Poh Choong, 64, the pandemic has strengthened his bond with his two sons, aged 19 and 12 respectively.“We spent a lot of time together during this MCO and I’m thankful for that.“My two sons are my source of courage and strength during moments when we were lonely and scared, ” says Tan, who has sole custody of the boys since his divorce with his wife seven years ago.As a former chief executive officer of an asset management company, some of Tan’s leadership skills got humorously translated into their home life during the MCO.“During the pandemic, I have had more time to monitor my boys and I could tell them to make their beds.“I could see their ethics at home, ” laughs Tan, adding that to be fair, the boys also got to know more of his habits too.Labelling fatherhood as “a sweet burden”, he says many parents believe they sacrificed for their children but he disagrees with that notion.“You don’t sacrifice for your children but you step up for them.“As a single parent, things can be overwhelming but my children have given me back love and protected my sanity.“And that sustains me. It’s a joy when they are around me and they give me purpose, ” Tan adds.\n",

It was wonderful.”“During this time when she can’t come back to Penang, we speak daily on the phone.“I miss her and hope to see her soon,” he said.Heng added that he felt safe after being fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and hopes all Malaysians will sign up for the vaccination.\n",

      "GA Malaysia equips individuals with in-demand digital skillsABOUT a quarter of all Malaysian jobs are expected to be displaced by 2030 due to digitalisation.The pandemic has accelerated the pace of change. Even as overall unemployment rises, the number of digital job vacancies has tripled in the past year, according to the Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC).Few careers will be left untouched by the rising demand for digital skill sets such as data science, digital marketing, product management, user experience design and more.Forward-looking professionals are racing to adapt by investing in digital skills development to remain relevant and continue progressing in their careers.Getting aheadGeneral Assembly (GA), a global pioneer in skills and career transformation, specialises in equipping individuals with today’s most in-demand skills.More than 100,000 GA graduates are employed at 19,000 organisations globally. GA is the number one provider of digital upskilling bootcamps in the United States.According to GA Malaysia CEO Andrew Pereira, professionals are looking for practical digital skills development with credentials that will advance their careers.“They want to learn immediately applicable skills from experts and earn a globally recognised qualification in the process, without an excessive time commitment,” he says.However, many only turn their mind to upskilling or reskilling when they are out of a job or unable to move up the corporate ladder.“Most skills have a shelf life. You need to be constantly restocking with fresh skills or you may find that the ones you have are outdated,” says Pereira.Many of today’s most in-demand skills such as Python (a coding language commonly used in data science) and data visualisation are not even widely recognised.“The business world is moving beyond just spreadsheets and slides. We are there to help professionals discover and develop skills to help them get ahead,” he says.Securing a jobThis need is even more pronounced among recent graduates and early career professionals. They have been disproportionately impacted by today’s tighter labour market as evidenced by the high graduate unemployment rate.“A lot of university graduates turn to us several months into their job search because they discover that their degrees and skill sets don’t match what employers are looking for,” says Pereira.“We have helped many change careers entirely – for instance, helping arts graduates secure data analyst or digital marketing roles.”According to GA’s most recent audited Student Outcomes Report, 91% of GA’s reskilling students secure a position in their new digital field within 180 days of graduation. That figure rises to over 99% after 180 days.Pereira attributes this success to the high quality of instruction and career coaching that GA provides.“We accept fewer than 10% of applicants for instructor roles and practice project-based learning.”MySTEP to learn digital skillsGeneral Assembly is partnering with Khazanah Nasional to deliver the MySTEP programme 2021 to support unemployed Malaysians.The four-month programme upskills learners in in-demand digital skills, offers globally-recognised certification, develops learners’ professional skills, and matches learners with career opportunities.Learners also earn RM 2,000 per month during the programme, so that they can focus on learning digital skills, developing professional skills, and on securing job opportunities in digital areas such as software engineering, data analytics, digital marketing and more.While joining the MySTEP programme 2021 is free, seats are limited and over 2,000 have applied for the programme within its first month. Applications for the programme can be made online by July 12.For more information on the programme, visit the website.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: After seeing people around them losing the means to earn a decent living, a young woman started an initiative to provide food baskets to struggling families around Kuala Terengganu.Dubbed the “KT Food Basket” project, it started with Nur Husna Anira Osmira and her friends pooling money from within their own circles to provide 53 families with provisions during the first week of lockdown, which started on June 1.“Initially, we just wanted to help a few families.“But after the first round, we started receiving more inquiries from people about the food basket project,” said the 27-year-old.By the end of the second week, Husna and her team had distributed food baskets to another 150 deserving families around Kuala Terengganu following a successful round of crowdfunding.“This whole project started when one of our neighbours asked if we knew of any aid programme during the lockdown as they were in need of help.“That gave us the idea to come up with this initiative. Most of those affected are people earning unfixed income such as odd-job labourers and stall operators who do not have permission to operate during the lockdown.“When we started delivering the food baskets, we met so many people who were struggling financially. Some do not even have the means to secure their next meal.“There are so many people who have fallen on hard times. It makes us reflect on how fortunate our situation is compared to them,” said Husna, who runs an online business.The target recipients for the KT Food Basket initiative were those working in the informal sector, daily wage earners, as well as families with sick or frail senior members or special needs children.Husna said she was touched to see how generous Malaysians were to those in need, adding that some members of the public even donated expensive milk for disabled recipients under the project.“We are so grateful that there are so many generous people out there who also trust us to do this,” she added.As the lockdown has been extended until June 28 and they still had some extra funds from public donations, Husna said they would be continuing with another round of the food baskets.“We learnt that doing groundwork is very tiring but we have to go on. There’s still no sign of when this pandemic will end,” she said, adding that it had been heartbreaking to witness so many people suffering financially.“What I would like to say to other fellow Malaysians is hang in there and keep helping each other, regardless of race or religion,” she said.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Malaysia has no cases of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with the use of Covid-19 mRNA vaccine, says the Health Ministry.This despite reports of such illnesses happening in the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore recently.Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the current benefits of receiving the vaccine far outweigh the risks and that Comirnaty (made by Pfizer-BioNTech) – the only mRNA vaccine type used in Malaysia – would continue to be administered.“The National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) has conducted a risk assessment on the safety issues based on information obtained from regulatory bodies and international references.“We concluded that the safety profile of this vaccine remained positive and its use in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme will not be affected,” he said in a statement.Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle while pericarditis refers to inflammation of the outer layer of the heart.Symptoms or symptoms associated with myocarditis or pericarditis include chest pain, changes in heart rate and difficulty breathing.As at June 13, a total of 2,793,826 of Comirnaty have been administered to the Malaysian population, involving a total of 1,676,959 first doses and 1,116,867 second doses.“To date, there has been no report of Adverse Event Following Immunisation specific to myocarditis or pericarditis,” Dr Noor Hisham said.So far, no regulatory action has been taken by other international bodies such as the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organisation on Covid-19 mRNA vaccine products.“The ministry will always conduct continuous monitoring through quality monitoring programmes of registered products and pharmacovigilance to ensure the quality, safety and effectiveness of vaccine products are always guaranteed,” he added.\n",

      "KUALA TERENGGANU: The Covid-19 vaccine acts as a “fortress”, protecting the body even if the vaccinated person is later exposed to the deadly virus.Two individuals who survived the infection said they did not experience any symptoms after being vaccinated.Nur Fazlizai Ali, a media practitioner, was infected about three weeks after completing the Sinovac vaccine shots.“I received the first dose on April 1 and the second on April 22. It was a bit of a shock at first when I was confirmed positive on May 12.‘’I was informed that the infection involved contacts while on duty.“I did ask the doctor several times just to reconfirm it. In the end, the answer remained the same, and I had to be placed at the Covid-19 Quarantine and Low-Risk Treatment Centre (PKRC),” she said.Nur Fazlizai, 34, recalled that it was a really difficult experience for her as she boarded a van from the Health Ministry to the PKRC at Universiti Teknologi Mara Chendering branch on the eve of Hari Raya Aidilfitri, as takbir Raya played on the radio.“I was really sad and scared. I couldn’t describe my feelings at that time but I prayed that the vaccine I had received before would be able to get me through this.“What I was worried about most was other people. Out of 30 close contacts, two of them were infected. Thankfully, they didn’t have severe symptoms,” she said.When asked if she had any doubts or regrets as she was still infected despite having been vaccinated, she said: “Of course not. If compared to other patients who have not received the vaccine, I am actually very fortunate.”Nur Fazlizai also said at the PKRC, many patients suffered severe cough, fever and loss of smell but as she was asymptomatic, she could do various things, including filing news stories.Sharing similar sentiments on the importance of taking the vaccine was Zaid Salim who also did not experience any symptoms.Zaid, who is a 50-year-old stringer with a newspaper company, received the vaccine on May 11.He tested positive three days later and was admitted to the same PKRC.“I was infected while doing coverage and did not know that some of those present were positive.“However, I did not suffer any health problems. Out of 40 of my close contacts, no one tested positive, including my family members,” said Zaid, who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.As he had tested positive, the second dose, which was supposed to be administered on June 14 had to be postponed.Both Nur Fazlizai and Zaid urged those selected to receive the jabs not to miss the opportunity to get vaccinated, as it not only protects them but also others. — Bernama\n",

      "KOTA KINABALU: An elephant calf which has been wandering in an estate after it was believed to have gotten lost in Lahad Datu, has been rescued by wildlife rangers.The male Borneo Pygmy calf, estimated to be just about a year old, was discovered by estate workers at the Felda FGV Sahabat 9 Baiduri Ayu estate on Tuesday.In a Facebook post, Sabah Wildlife Department assistant director Dr Sen Nathan said workers informed the Lahad Datu Wildlife Department after they found the animal.“Rangers went to check on the calf and watched it for a few days while trying to get it to go with a nearby herd of pygmy elephants. But the herd did not accept it,” he said, adding that Wildlife Rescue Unit (WRU) rangers were later called to help.He said the rejection by the herd could be due to several reasons.The herd did not acknowledge the calf or it had been away from other elephant groups for too long, he said.Another possibility was that there was too much human scent on the calf as it has been in close proximity with humans, he added.Nevertheless, Dr Sen said the calf will meet new elephants to call them family soon, as it has been taken to the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre.In his Facebook post, he said the calf, apart from being confused, was bright, alert and responsive.Dr Sen said rangers had tried to feed it with milk but it did not want to drink, as it was not familiar with the flavour.“It, however, drank lots of water and ate banana trunks,” he said, adding the calf has been named Yuri.He said Yuri had minor skin injuries on the left forelimbs and front head.He expressed his thanks to the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, Malaysian Palm Oil Green Conservation Foundation, Orangutan Appeal UK and Oregon Zoo for funding all the wildlife operations that the wildlife rescue unit had conducted.\n",

      "ANIS FARID AND，ABINAYA MOHAN\n",
      "IN a time where fathers want to be more involved in their children’s lives, Father's Day is an opportunity to reflect on our current paternity leave policies. Do we as a society understand a father’s role and involvement in early childhood? Are we practicing gender equality?Paternity leave matters because it makes it clear that caregiving is a shared responsibility, helping decrease the gender pay gap and allowing fathers to be actively involved in raising their children.In Malaysia, fathers in the public sector enjoy seven days of leave to welcome and bond with their newborn, whilst those in the private sector are not entitled to any leave at all. In the now delayed commitment to amend the Employment Act of 1955, the Human Resources Ministry proposed a total of three days paternity leave for the private sector. This is simply not enough.Most fathers value hands-on parenting.Benny, a sustainability professional, has enjoyed this process: “From the very beginning until now, I’m still very much helping with the night sessions of feeding and changing diapers. It’s a tag team effort of a husband and wife to raise children.”New dad Jo Fan, whose son was born a few days before the first movement control order, says working from home allowed him “to witness all the first milestones.”The past year, being in a pandemic and several MCOs, has provided insight into why paternity leave is urgent and necessary for both parents.Jo Fan believes being at home allowed him to better support his wife, which is crucial, especially as first time parents, “because it’s a period of high stress.”As difficult as the pandemic may be, WFH has granted this unique opportunity and allowed fathers to contribute more. Studies based in the UK have found that, following the first Covid-19 lockdown, there was a 58% increase in childcare undertaken by men. In 2020, men were spending 64% of the time that women spent on childcare, compared to 39% in 2015. Farihah and her spouse, who welcomed their second child last year, speak to how caregiving was now more equally split compared to their experience with their eldest.Paternity leave is also positive for mothers. In a survey conducted by Women’s Aid Organisation (WAO) and Vase.ai, 55% of women felt their partners had insufficient paternity leave. This negatively affected their health, and 65% of these women said that it also impacted their child and family. Introducing a seven day paternity leave could alleviate these stressors.Additionally, women in Malaysia were hardest hit during the pandemic, with many leaving their jobs because of the double burden of caregiving and working. We also have one of the lowest labour force participation rates for women in Southeast Asia. Paternity leave helps bridge this gap as the World Bank data shows women are more likely to participate in the labour market with paid paternity leave – and obviously, the longer the better.Farihah can attest to this, having interviewed for and starting a new job late last year, thanks to the support of her husband who was working from home and leading on caregiving.Spending quality time with a new born and supporting their partners should be a father’s right. Currently, Malaysia lags behind its neighbours in paternity leave days. The Philippines allows 14 days leave, whilst Indonesia entitles its fathers to a month if they are public servants and two days paid leave in the private sector. Vietnam also allows between 5-14 days of paternity leave.Even with the proposed three day paternity leave provision, many parents still feel this is insufficient. For Benny and for Farihah, the ideal paternity leave would be three months, or what is often referred to as the fourth trimester. But, for a start, seven days would help many families.Welcoming a new baby into the family is an exciting experience for parents but they also need time to adjust and a longer paternity leave lets both parents figure out a routine that works. It is also a practical approach, as Farihah points out, it helps ease the process of sorting out post-birth matters, including birth registration and immediate check-ups for babies.As we move towards recovery and reopening, fathers will soon return to work. It’s imperative we begin reconsidering our paternity leave policies. This is not just about fathers – it’s about families. In this, we urge Parliament to re-open to pass the Employment Act and grant fathers at least 7 days of paternity leave. This Father's Day, as we reflect on the role we want dads to play, this amendment is a good step towards a more equal society. As Farihah says, “If we orient our society towards prioritising family-friendly policies, we’ll all be better for it.”Anis Farid is the Women’s Aid Organisation’s research and advocacy officer while Abinaya Mohan is WAO’s head of campaigns. The views expressed here are solely their own.\n",

      "GOMBAK: It was almost a two-hour journey for Orang Asli tok batin (village chief) Nengkak Anak Mat to reach Hospital Orang Asli Gombak to get his Covid-19 jab.Despite fears and concerns expressed by his fellow villagers, the tok batin of Sungai Kurau village on Carey Island was adamant on getting vaccinated.When asked whether he was afraid of being vaccinated, the 75-year-old said there was nothing to fear and added that he wanted to encourage his villagers to do the same thing.“It’s not about being scared or not, this is the duty of the tok batin. We want to set an example to the villagers.“There are some villagers who run away when the mobile clinic arrives. Sometimes parents take their children to the river or near the sea because they are afraid they will fall ill if they get vaccinated.“So I thought it was better for me to go. After I return to the village, I can tell my villagers that I don’t feel any pain. Some of them tried to persuade me not to go, but I came anyway,” he said.Nengkak was among 60 Orang Asli, 27 of whom are village chiefs, who received the Covid-19 vaccine at the hospital yesterday.Another tok batin, Ilan Johos, said his villagers at Kampung Orang Asli Broga in Semenyih were also fearful of getting vaccinated.“When I met the villagers and told them about registering with the Orang Asli Development Department (Jakoa) for vaccination, they declined, saying that they had read on Facebook that there were people who had died and all sorts of stories.“I told them that if I get vaccinated and I die here, then they do not need to get the jab. But if I do get the jab and I return home, then my villagers should all get the jab.“I am the first person in my village to get vaccinated,” said the 57-year-old.He said no person in any part of Malaysia was safe from the virus without vaccination.“Yes, (the Orang Asli) live in the village and perhaps last time we could rely on forest produce to survive, but now we can’t.“We go out to work at the factories and do other kinds of jobs. The young people who go out to work could bring the virus back to the village; that’s why the disease is spreading,” he said.Andak Pendek, tok batin at the Kuala Pangsun village, said the injection felt like an “ant bite” and the process was fast.He was also getting vaccinated to show his people back home that there was nothing to fear.“In our village, a lot of people are influenced by information on WhatsApp that claims vaccines are dangerous to the community, especially those who are elderly and with other health problems.“But no matter what, it is still necessary for me to take the vaccine because I regularly go out to the town or market to buy things,” he said.\n",

      "PUTRAJAYA (Bernama): The Health Ministry is studying whether the time interval for the second AstraZeneca vaccine dose can be shortened from 12 weeks to six weeks, says Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba (pic).He said this would depend on expert reports on the Covid-19 situation in the country, whether the vaccine recipients require maximum protection from the second dose more quickly.\"We still have to conduct continuous genome sequencing activity to detect if there is a new, more violent Covid-19 variant that could affect the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The decision will be made by the JKJAV (COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Access Guarantee Special Committee) if the second dose must be given sooner,” he said in a news conference at his office here, on Saturday (June 19).Currently, the interval for the AstraZeneca vaccine is 12 weeks or three months.Meanwhile, he said the government would study reports from the country’s health expert and Australian health authority after the country stopped administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to individuals aged below 60, following concern that the vaccine was linked to blood clot cases among the group.Dr Adham said this was especially on the supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced by suppliers from Thailand which would arrive in July.\"Our experts will re-evaluate whether the AstraZeneca vaccine is suitable for those aged 60 and below,” he said.Malaysia had procured the Covid-19 vaccine produced by AstraZeneca through the Covax facility and directly from the manufacturer.Dr Adham said so far, the overall data showed that the AstraZeneca vaccine did not cause serious harm to recipients in Malaysia.Commenting on the first dose strategy, he said the government has no plan to implement such a strategy because the vaccine supply ordered was sufficient for the people in this country.Through the strategy, the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is given to more people by extending the interval for the second dose. The strategy has been implemented by countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany.In a related development, Dr Adham said the government was implementing the \"vaccinate first, register later\" method for those who are having difficulties registering for vaccination, especial in the rural areas.This was done by activating the mobile team to track down the target groups that were supposed to get the vaccine in the second phase of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.\"We are targeting to inoculate 9.4 million people in the second phase but so far, only 4.4 million have registered via the MySejahtera app. So, we are going all out to deploy the team to cover all recipients, before we can proceed with the third phase,” he said.The second phase of the immunisation programme focuses on senior citizens, persons with disabilities and those with chronic illnesses.Meanwhile, Dr Adham said those who have been vaccinated must continue to practise public health action so that the risk of infection could be contained effectively.\"There is still a probability for those who have been vaccinated to be infected with Covid-19 as the virus has been in the community. We need to continue practising new norms such as wearing face masks, washing hands frequently, observing physical distance and avoiding crowded places and direct contact with others,” he said.He added that Covid-19 vaccination serves to protect recipients from getting a serious infection, hence, the government through the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) would ensure that whatever vaccines that are being used have been confirmed safe, effective and of high quality.Dr Adham said the government was in the midst of formulating a strategy to inoculate individuals aged between 12 and 17, totalling 3.5 million people, following the approval to administer the Comirnaty vaccine produced by Pfizer-BioNTech to the group.- Bernama\n",

However, we still wear face masks where needed,\" he said during the Antara Keperluan dan Khilaf Covid-19 virtual panel discussion aired on Bernama TV Saturday (June 19) night.The programme moderator was Bernama chairman Datuk Ras Adiba Radzi with other panellists comprising Shireen Abdullah in San Diego, United States and Haliza Hashim in London, United Kingdom as well as strategic planning exco for Medical Mythbuster Malaysia's vaccination campaign Dr Megat Mohamad Amirul Amzar Megat Hashim, who was in the studio.According to Haliza, the desire to enjoy freedom outside was the motivating factor for more people in the United Kingdom to get vaccinated against Covid-19, with a total of 30 million people who have received both doses of the vaccine so far.She said getting vaccinated was considered as the only way to enjoy daily activities like before, such as dining in restaurants, watching football matches, attending concerts and theatres and going for holidays.The UK government also opened up vaccination centres in community areas to ensure more people receive their vaccine to achieve herd immunity.\"Various campaigns involving celebrities and religious figures were held to encourage vaccination, including opening up vaccination centres near mosques, churches, Chinatown – and not marginalising migrant workers,\" she added.Sharing her experience in San Diego, Shireen said the people are no longer required to wear face masks outside due to the improving Covid-19 situation, with almost 50% of the population in the area vaccinated.Shireen, who had been fully vaccinated, said she felt more comfortable and safe going out now, but still chose to wear face masks as an additional preventive measure. – Bernama\n",

      "All units at a major Chinese dam designed to send power from the Yangtze valley in the southwest to the most populous parts of the country have started generating electricity, state media reported on Wednesday.Wudongde Dam, the world’s seventh-largest hydroelectric station, is a major plank of the country’s plans to meet its growing electricity needs while cutting emissions.Yang Zongli, director of the Wudongde project, said the station’s 12 turbines could help the country reach “peak emissions” and “carbon neutrality”, a reference to China’s commitment to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by at least 65 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2060.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.“After all units are put into operation, the power supply in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area will be further safeguarded,” Yang told Xinhua.Coal burning contributes up to 70 per cent of carbon in Yangtze River sediment, study findsThe station will generate an average of 38.9 billion kilowatt hours of electricity a year after it goes into full operation, the equivalent of burning 12.2 million tonnes of coal – or enough to save 30.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. One day’s output alone would be enough to meet the energy needs of 300,000 people for a year.Since the first batch of power units started running last June, the station has produced 24 billion KWH, enough for a city of 8.5 million people for eight months, CCTV added.The 120 billion yuan (US$18.7 billion) dam spans the Jinsha River, the name given to the upper stretches of the Yangtze, near the border between Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.In 2015 before construction started, geologists and water scientists voiced concerns that building a dam in earthquake-prone Wudongde was risky and the dams would damage the ecology of the lower stretches of the Yangtze.The Wudongde dam, which has a total storage capacity of 7.4 billion cubic meters, equivalent to nearly 3 million Olympic-sized swimming pools, is also designed to control floods and make river transport easier.Its maximum flood discharge can reach 37,000 cubic metres a second, enough to fill Hangzhou’s celebrated West Lake in just seven minutes.Will a new law bring China’s dying Yangtze River back to life?The dam is the first in a chain of four along the downstream section of the Jinsha, while the Yangtze proper is home to the Three Gorges Dam, now the world’s biggest hydropower project in terms of installed capacity.Last year the Three Gorges generated 111.8 billion KWH of electricity, breaking a record previously held by the Itaipu Dam on the border of Brazil and Paraguay, according to national trade association the China Electricity Council.More from South China Morning Post:China’s dam rush: critics query hydropower path to carbon neutralityHow China built the world’s largest arch dam in just four yearsFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021.\n",

      "JEFFREY D. SACHS\n",
      "THE latest Group of 7 summit was a waste of resources. If it had to be held at all, it should have been conducted online, saving time, logistical costs and airplane emissions. But, more fundamentally, G-7 summits are an anachronism.There was absolutely nothing at the G-7summit that could not have been accomplished much more cheaply, easily and routinely by Zoom. Online international meetings by politicians, parliamentarians, scientists and activists are important. They normalise international discussions.But why should those discussions occur within the G-7, which has been superseded by the Group of 20? When the G-7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States) began their annual summit meetings in the 1970s, they still dominated the world economy. In 1980, they constituted 51% of world’s gross domestic product (measured at international prices), whereas the developing countries of Asia accounted for just 8.8%. In 2021, the G-7 countries produce a mere 31% of world GDP, while the same Asian countries produce 32.9%.The G-20, by including China, India, Indonesia and other large developing countries, represents around 81% of world output, and balances the interests of its high-income and developing economies. It is not perfect, as it leaves out smaller and poorer countries and should add the African Union as a member, but at least the G-20 offers a fruitful format for discussing global topics covering most of the world economy.The G-7 is particularly irrelevant because its leaders don’t deliver on their promises. They like making symbolic statements, not solving problems. Worse, they give the appearance of solving global problems, while really leaving them to fester. This year’s summit was no different.Consider Covid-19 vaccines. The G-7 leaders set the goal of vaccinating at least 60% of the global population. They also pledged to share 870 million doses directly over the next year, presumably meaning enough for 435 million fully immunised individuals (with two doses per person). But 60% of the global population comes to 4.7 billion people, or roughly 10 times that number.The G-7 leaders offered no plan for achieving their stated aim of global coverage, and in fact, have not developed one, even though it would not be hard to do. Estimating the monthly production of every Covid-19 vaccine is straightforward, and allocating those doses fairly and efficiently to all countries is entirely feasible.One reason such a plan has not yet been developed is that the US government so far refuses to sit down with Russian and Chinese leaders to devise such a global allocation. Another reason is that the G-7 governments let the vaccine manufacturers negotiate privately and secretly, rather than as part of a global plan. Perhaps a third reason is that the G-7 looked at global targets without thinking hard enough about the needs of each recipient country.Yet another example of the G-7’s false promises is climate change. At the latest summit, G-7 leaders rightly embraced the goal of global decarbonisation by 2050 and called on developing countries to do so as well. They reiterated a financial pledge first made in 2009 that was never fulfilled: “We reaffirm the collective developed country goal to jointly mobilise US$100bil per year from public and private sources, through to 2025.”The rich countries missed their own deadline of 2020 for providing the long-promised US$100bil per year – a mere 0.2% of rich countries’ annual GDP. And the promised US$100bil is itself a small fraction of what developing countries need for decarbonisation and climate adaptation.The disconnect between the G-7’s soaring aims and meager means is apparent on education as well. Hundreds of millions of children in poor countries lack access to primary and secondary education because their governments don’t have the financial means to provide teachers, classrooms and supplies.In 2020, Unesco estimated that the low- and lower-middle-income countries need around US$504bil per year up to 2030 to ensurethat all kids complete a secondary education. But they have only around $356 billion of their own domestic resources, leaving a financing gap of around US$148bil per year.Yet the G-7 leaders propose “a target to get 40 million more girls into education and with at least $2.75 billion for the Global Partnership for Education.” These are not serious numbers. They are pulled out of thin air and would leave hundreds of millions of children out of school. Large-scale solutions are available – such as mobilising low-interest financing from multilateral development banks – but the G-7 leaders didn’t propose such solutions.The world’s problems are far too urgent to leave to empty posturing and to measures that are a mere token of what is needed. If politics were a mere spectator sport, to be judged by which politicians mugged for the cameras best, the G-7 summit would perhaps have a role to play. But we have urgent global needs to meet.My recommendations: fewer face-to-face meetings, more serious homework to link means and ends, more routine Zoom meetings to discuss what really needs to be done and greater reliance on the G-20 (plus the African Union) as the group that can actually follow through. We need Asia, Africa and Latin America at the table for any true global problem solving. — LosAngeles Times/TNSJeffrey D.

      "Novavax's Covid-19 jab is more than 90% effective, including against coronavirus variants, the vaccine maker said on June 14 (2021) after a large-scale study.The jab “demonstrated 100% protection against moderate and severe disease, 90.4% efficacy overall”, the company said in a statement.It added that “the study enrolled 29,960 participants across 119 sites in the United States and Mexico to evaluate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.”The US-based company said it intended to apply for regulatory approval by the third quarter of this year (2021).After that, it said, it would be on course to make 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter and 150 million doses per month by the end of the year.While some rich countries have made progress on vaccinating their populations, there remain concerns that many poorer countries are being left out of the global inoculation drive.Vaccination rates in the world’s poorest nations are far behind the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised powers and other wealthy states.In terms of doses administered so far, the imbalance between the G7 and low-income countries, as defined by the World Bank, is 73 to one.Novavax’s vaccine – formally known as NVX-CoV2373 – can be stored in normal refrigerators.The company said it was “stored and stable at 2°-8°C, allowing the use of existing vaccine supply chain channels for its distribution.“In theory at least, this means the shots should be more easily transported and administered in countries with less well-developed health infrastructures.”The two-dose vaccine consists of modified SARS-CoV-2 viral spike proteins encased in a synthetic lipid nanoparticle, accompanied by a saponin-based adjuvant.Doses are to be given three weeks apart. – AFP Relaxnews\n",

      "A travel buddy told me that he had heard about “fugu” (pufferfish), and that eating it is good for one’s health. But because it’s also poisonous, he wouldn’t dare try it.During the Shogunate Era, around 270AD, there were reports of samurais dying after eating fugu. As such, at the end of the 16th century, General Toyotomi Hideyoshi banned the consumption of fugu. However, people living in the Yamaguchi prefecture in Kyushu still ate the so-called deadly fish, simply because it was so delicious.In October 1868, at the start of the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese people – who were under a new emperor – secretly started eating fugu. But due to a shortage of chefs who were capable of handling fugu professionally, many people were poisoned and died after eating the fish.Consequently, the Meiji government tightened its control on the consumption of fugu.The fugu’s liver is intensely toxic, and a person could be killed within 10 to 30 minutes after ingesting the toxin by accident, unless he or she is rushed to the hospital immediately.Having said that, though, the proteins in fugu have exceptional medicinal value, and you can be sure that the courageous Japanese people are not going to give up such a wonderful god-sent delicacy.Hirobumi Ito, who became Japan’s first prime minister in December 1885 (and served for a total of four terms) tried for the very first time a fugu hot pot dish specially prepared for him by Fujino-san at Shunpanro restaurant in his native Yamaguchi prefecture. He was impressed by the meal.Ito later insisted that everyone should try this wonderful gastronomic gift from heaven. In 1888, he lifted the ban on the consumption of fugu, and naturally, Shunpanro became the primary base for fugu ryori or the cooking of fugu.Other prefectures and cities, meanwhile, could not keep up with Yamaguchi as there weren’t many chefs who knew how to handle the delicate fish.The 53-year-old Ito also used Shunpanro to promote fugu internationally.For example, the 29-day negotiation of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, one of the century’s most monumental historical events between Japan and China, was held at Shunpanro in 1895. Ito served fugu to the 72-year-old chief negotiator from China’s Qing dynasty, Li Hongzhang, and his delegation.Unfortunately, Li declined the meal for fear of getting poisoned.Li and his delegation were aware that fugu was such a precious premium culinary treat, and turning down the meal may have consequences. During the course of the negotiation, Li was shot in his left cheek by a rebel named Toyotaro Koyama.The Meiji government apologised to the Qing dynasty government.On June 16, 1909, Ito again enjoyed his favourite fugu hot pot at Shunpanro. The following day, he boarded a ship to the Korean peninsula, which followed a trip to Dalian in China. He arrived at the Harbin railway station on June 26, but was unfortunately killed there by Korean nationalist An Jung-geun.Ito had objected to the colonisation of Manchuria by Japan, but he couldn’t do anything to change anything. His assassination was about 10 days after he ate fugu for the very last time.(Some of these historical facts on fugu are based on Hisako Kuroiwa’s book, Diplomacy On The Tip Of The Tongue.)Today, whenever Japanese folks enjoy a fugu feast, they may just be reminded of Ito, I guess. He once said that it is a heavenly food all Japanese people must enjoy together.While fugu has slowly become a unique delicacy that ordinary citizens can enjoy today, the dish is only available for dine-in customers at specialised fugu restaurants. Most of these shops offer five different ways of enjoying the fish, namely shredded fish skin in vinegar; thin sashimi slices; deep fried fish fillets; hot pot with fish meat, fish bone, cabbage, tofu and kombu; and fugu rice porridge with egg and seaweed.During the last Fukui tour that I led with renowned food critic Chua Lam, he made a special arrangement for group members to go to the Hamato Fugu Restaurant at Kuroshio Market in Osaka for lunch.At this restaurant, the chefs demonstrated how to kill a live fugu, which was impressive. But while they did this, many in the group began to worry whether the toxins from the fish would splash onto them!Chua assured them that will never happen as the folks who work at the restaurant are all seasoned fugu chefs. He also playfully said, “Look at the fugu sperm. The gentlemen here should try the fugu sperm wine later, there is no fishy smell at all. It’ll make you strong tonight!”I think that most foodies are not afraid of the fugu toxin, and would not think twice about eating the fish – provided it was handled by experts, of course. Some especially like to challenge themselves and try the fugu’s liver and stomach lining, usually served finely chopped and seasoned with green onion vinegar, and a special Japanese condiment.I must say that this dish is particularly delicious – simply heavenly!Pufferfish-rearing has become a high-value aquacultural industry today. Nevertheless, in Yamaguchi prefecture, which has so far produced eight Japanese prime ministers including Hirobumi Ito, Eisaku Sato and Shinzo Abe, people still insist on eating wild-caught fugu instead.When we can all travel again, I’ll take you to Shunpanro to eat fugu.The views expressed are entirely the writer’s own.Leesan, the founder of Apple Vacations, has travelled to 132 countries, six continents and enjoys sharing his travel stories and insights.

      "YANGON/TOKYO, June 20 (Bloomberg): When hundreds of protesters gathered outside Japan’s embassy in Yangon during the height of nationwide anti-coup protests in February, Ambassador Ichiro Maruyama emerged from the gates with a firm warning for the junta: Release the detained civilian leadership \"immediately.”The remarks, delivered in Burmese, drew applause from pro-democracy demonstrators hoping Japan would take concrete action to pressure Myanmar’s military, also known as the Tatmadaw.But since then Japan has resisted calls to impose sanctions or suspend ongoing infrastructure projects, saying only it would avoid carrying out any new non-humanitarian deals with the junta.\"Within the international community our country has many routes of communication with Myanmar, including the Myanmar military, ” a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said by phone in response to written questions. \"We understand that many countries, not just ours, are considering what is the best way to deal with this, based on the situation.”Still, the country also has a history of defending Myanmar generals. In 2019, Ambassador Maruyama said \"there is no genocide in Myanmar” in response to a case at the International Court of Justice over allegations of atrocities on its Muslim Rohingya population in western Rakhine State.\"We fully believe that the Myanmar military will keep its promise” to prosecute anyone who committed human-rights abuses, the Irrawaddy quoted him as saying.Beijing has blocked uniform sanctions at the United Nations Security Council and said its policy toward Myanmar was unaffected by the coup, granting the regime legitimacy on the world stage.\"Given how much money they have put in, and the fact that they see it as geo-economic competition with China, they are very hesitant to pull out, ” Simon Tay, chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said regarding Japan.Japan’s ties with the Southeast Asian country go back to World War II, when the regime in Tokyo helped revolutionaries led by Aung San - father of modern Myanmar and the now detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi - form the Tatmadaw in its fight for independence. While Japan later occupied Myanmar until 1945 and Aung San turned against them, the countries have maintained close relations even under long periods of military rule.When Myanmar ushered in sweeping political and economic reforms about a decade ago, Japan was rewarded with high-status projects, joining with public enterprises to establish the Yangon Stock Exchange and the country’s only operational special economic zone. As of April, Japan was its third largest foreign investor nation behind Singapore and China, with nearly $2.4 billion in capital since the 2016-17 fiscal year, according to data from Myanmar’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration.But since the Feb. 1 coup, companies have come under intense pressure to back away from investments tied to the military after security forces killed hundreds of protesters.Among them is Kirin Holdings Co., which said days after the coup it would end its joint-venture partnership with military-run Myanma Economic Holdings Public Co. in the country’s largest brewer after buying a $560 million majority stake six years earlier. In a statement, the company said it’s \"taking urgent steps” to terminate the arrangement but didn’t have a timeline yet.Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group was listed in a December report by Justice for Myanmar among international companies connected to Telecom International Myanmar Co. Ltd., or Mytel, a company the U.S. Department of the Treasury said was set up by Min Aung Hlaing. A Mitsubishi spokesperson said the company doesn’t comment on individual businesses.Justice for Myanmar alleges that Mytel’s biggest shareholder, Viettel Group, which is owned by Vietnam’s Defense Ministry, mines user-data that could be used for military purposes by the Myanmar junta. The regime had also ordered operators to shut their networks in an effort to stifle protests following the coup. A Viettel spokesperson said the company would not comment on the issue, while Mytel didn't respond to multiple requests via email and phone for comment.The Japanese government is more concerned with economic and human security in Myanmar than punishing the military with coercive moves, according to Moe Thuzar, a fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\"The half measures here are probably intended as negotiation points toward a constructive outcome, ” she said. \"The risk here is of course the military junta manipulating any space that it is given, or deciding to ‘walk with fewer friends.’” - Bloomberg\n",

      "BANGKOK, June 20 (Bernama): Thailand is planning for wider reopening to vaccinated visitors, without the need to undergo mandatory quarantine, to its top tourist destinations from July 1, in a bid to revive its tourism industry hit hard by Covid-19 pandemic.To curb the Covid-19 outbreak, Thailand imposed strict entry requirement and quarantine measures last year where the travel curbs saw tourist arrivals in the kingdom plummet to 6.7 million last year compared to nearly 40 million visitors in 2019.Starting July 1, Thailand popular resort island, Phuket sets to reopen to fully vaccinated visitors under \"Phuket Sandbox” while famous tourist islands Koh Samui, Koh Phang Nga and Koh Tao under \"Samui Plus” scheduled to welcome vaccinated tourists from July 15.In a statement, the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said the ‘island approach’ will continue in August with an ‘extension’ to the concept where travellers to Phuket will link with \"Krabi Even More Amazing” which include Koh Phi Phi, Koh Ngai and Koh Railay or \"Phang Nan Prompt” (linking Khao Lak and Koh Yao).From September, TAT said the \"Sealed Approach” will be launched for specific areas and routes under \"Charming Chiang Mai” (Mueang, Mae Rim, Mae Tang and Doi Tao Districts), Chon Buri: Neo Pattaya (Pattaya City and Bang Lamung and Sattahip Districts), and Buri Ram (Mueang District and the Chang Arena).Starting October or within the fourth quarter, TAT said Bangkok, Cha-Am and Hua Hin, as well as any other Thai destinations that is ready will be reopened to vaccinated foreign tourists without quarantine.TAT Governor Yuthasak Supasorn said TAT has been instructed by the Ministry of Tourism and Sport to adjust its strategy with the aim to reopen pilot destinations under the ‘island and sealed approach’ within the third quarter, leading to the reopening of more destinations from October.\"For Buri Ram specifically, 70 per cent of the local population must be inoculated in preparation for the 2021 Thailand MotoGP at the Chang International Circuit on 8-10 October, ” he said.The reopening plan for these tourist destinations come with conditions that these provinces have vaccinated 70 per cent of their population and the infection rate is at no more than 20 to 30 cases per day.On June 16, Prime Minister Prayuth ChanO-Cha announced Thailand will reopen to fully vaccinated visitors within the next 120 days or by mid-October to revive its economy impacted severely by the Covid-19.Thailand plans to inoculate 50 million people with at least their first shots administered by early October.Over the last 24 hours, Thailand recorded 3, 667 new Covid-19 cases and 32 fatalities, bringing the total infections in the kingdoms to 214, 449 and 1, 609 deaths to date.Of the new cases, Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) said 3, 635 were local transmission and 32 imported cases.The fatalities involved 17 females and 15 men aged between 40 and 89 years old including 19 in Bangkok, three each in Nakhon Pathom and Samut Prakan, two each in Phetchaburi and Khon Kaen, and one each in Samut Sakhon, Chon Buri and Chachoengsao. - Bernama\n",

      "AMONG the various heads of state and government who have seemed like permanent fixtures on the international political landscape in the past decade or so, no one’s perch has looked as precarious as that of Benjamin Netanyahu. There’s a degree of irony in the fact that Israel’s longest-serving prime minister apparently ran out of steam midway through the presidential term of one of the most fervent White House admirers he could conceivably have attracted.It’s all relative, of course. Ever since its inception, Israel has never not had an ally in the White House, and occasional tensions have scarcely dampened US enthusiasm for – let alone hindered its munificence towards – what was identified early on as an invaluable satellite in a region once deemed broadly hostile to US interests.The Obama administration, for instance, set a record in generosity, notwithstanding the toxic personal chemistry between Bibi and Barack. By then, it hardly looked like a case of the tail wagging the dog. The transformation may not have been sudden, but Netanyahu had few qualms about treating America as the tail.He was happy to do most of the barking until another top dog chimed in, determined, as the leader of the pack, to be louder than anyone else. And loyally tagging along behind Donald was Jared Kushner.Even Trump and Kushner apparently baulked, however, when Netanyahu talked about fulfilling his dream of annexing much of the occupied West Bank. Had the US flashed the green light, enabling him to pursue this project, Netanyahu would probably still be prime minister, and Israel would almost certainly be embroiled in a military campaign far more vicious than its most recent assault on the Gaza Strip.The latter did not suffice to keep him in power – not least because a substantial proportion of Israelis are under the impression that he chickened out. Unable to pull together a coalition after Israel’s fourth election in two years, Netanyahu predictably ranted against the alternative regime that was taking shape.In the past couple of weeks he has ludicrously labelled his opponents as dangerous and far left. The new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, is an extremist all right, but on the other end of the ideological spectrum. He has served Netanyahu as chief of staff and in various ministerial capacities, and throughout his political career has been described as even more right wing than his former master.In the past he has not only enthusiastically hailed the idea of West Bank annexation but also proudly boasted about seeing “no problem” having “killed lots of Arabs in my life”. As a prime minister at the head of a disparate – and desperate – eight-party coalition, whose Yamina party boasts only six seats in the 120-member Knesset, he has at first indicated that there will be no movement on the Palestinian front.The idea that the status quo can indefinitely be maintained while the state-sponsored settlers (whom Bennett has been proud to represent) keep gnawing away at what’s left of the diminishing Palestinian territories is one of Netanyahu’s proudest achievements. There’s no need to bother with a deal, not even with an eagerly compliant Palestinian “authority” in place under Mahmoud Abbas, who put off his elections to ward off the likelihood of another triumph for Hamas.That likelihood has only increased in recent months, but yet another Israeli election before the end of the year cannot be written off. After all, the Bennett-led coalition has the bare minimum parliamentary support necessary, and Netanyahu as opposition leader will no doubt continue trying to topple his rivals. The “Bye bye Bibi” placards displayed by jubilant demonstrators after his comeuppance may prove to have been premature.Does any of this matter very much? Not for the Palestinians. Sure, there is an Arab Islamist party on the fringes of the Bennett coalition, playing pretty much the sort of collaborationist role that the odd relatively unrepresentative black organisation did under South African apartheid. It also includes the Meretz and Labour parties, which remain wedded, at least formally, to the fantasy of a two-state solution.What’s far more important is that the political centre has shifted sharply to the right – Netanyahu deserves some of the credit for that, but the narrowing of the political spectrum from the centre right to the far right is by no means an exclusively Israeli phenomenon. Hardly anywhere, though, is the political system more fractured: what once were factions have evolved into a plethora of parties, and one-party majorities are now a thing of the past.Netanyahu has hitherto thrived on this dysfunction, but whether he can exploit it much longer remains to be seen. The criminal justice system may catch up with him. One thing that won’t change, however, is what Joe Biden reiterated last week: “Israel has no better friend than the United States.” Which in effect means nothing will really change. — Dawn/Asia News Network\n",

      "DURING an open debate before he was elected chairman of South Korea’s main Opposition People Power Party last week, Lee Jun-seok said he made “several hundred million won (several hundred thousand dollars)” through cryptocurrency trading. Later he reported spending just 30 million won (RM109, 458), seemingly from these earnings, for his intra-party leadership campaign.It is no surprise that the 36-year-old prodigy who majored in computer science and economics at Harvard University is so well versed in today’s digital culture and technology that he made a profitable investment in the virtual money market. It was rather admirable, in fact, that he had time to do so amidst the rigours of the leadership contest that immediately followed the People Power Party’s landslide win in mayoral by-elections in Seoul and Busan. The victories came after he had been given just two years to manage the part. The youngest ever Opposition leader is destined to make his mark in history including a possible takeover of power from the current leftist rulers.An Opposition surge has continued after the vote in South Korea’s two largest metropolises with the People Power Party outrunning the ruling Democratic Party of Korea in popularity polls for the first time in four years. But the outlook for a candidate for the March 9, 2022, presidential election is still hazy because Lee can’t run as he doesn’t meet the minimum age requirement of 40.Lee’s rise to Opposition leadership has signalled the rush towards the political stage of the younger “20-30” generation in Korea. They began asserting themselves as the main protesters in demonstrations against former president Park Geun-hye’s misrule in late 2016. After four years, they have become the core complainants against the present Moon Jae-in government.It is unfortunate that the latter part of Moon’s five-year rule coincided with the raging coronavirus pandemic on top of poor results of his ineffective economic policies. Jobs disappeared across the board, more seriously in the youth’s domain of service work, and government handouts mainly benefited the older population. Galloping apartment prices under short-sighted regulations pushed young wage earners into despair because housing ownership is farther away.Korea’s younger generation traditionally tilts to the left while right- wingers rely on the sympathy of the older populace. However, Moon’s failures changed the direction of political dynamics in Korea. Generational stereotypes are no longer evident – and Lee seized the opportunity for his ambition.A new age is arriving and pundits are seeing the need for the traditional right-wing force to give up their regional and generational bases. The conservatives have remained defensive following democratic reforms in the late 1980s as they have inevitably been regarded as reactionaries to political progress. Winning and losing power alternately and undergoing divisions and mergers, the right-wing force kept changing their name time and again over the years until settling on the People Power Party after the staggering defeat in Assembly elections last year.The party now has to search for a presidential candidate from outside the rather than inside, as its uneven history has depleted its leadership assets. The first order of business for chairman Lee is to invite former Prosecutor-General Yoon Seok-youl and the centrist Ahn Cheol-su to join the his party and stage a spectacular nomination race.As the stature of Yoon looms large aided by the Lee Jun-seok phenomenon, the ruling camp is concentrating on exposing any dirty linen in the former top prosecutor’s personal life and impropriety in his role as the top hunter of the “past evil” during the early days of the Moon’s rule. Yoon will have his first taste of politics when he defends himself against the mudslinging.In countering the leftist offensive, the People Power Party and supporting right-wingers should keep two principles: First, they should never compromise their moral high ground, and second, they should be flexible about their conservative values. Half of the reason for the Moon administration’s loss of the people’s trust is the moral degradation of its star figures and the other half is the miserable outcome of its ideology-dictated economic policies.The coming presidential polls in March and local elections in June 2022 will be an exciting time because parties will abandon traditional criteria in the nomination process and much emphasis will be placed on the ability to communicate with younger voters. Those who know the language of the digital culture and are comfortable playing with its products have a clear advantage.Lee is opening a new chapter in Korean politics which drives people to seek power not just for power’s sake but in pursuit of fresh ideals. The beautiful irony is that Lee represents not a progressive party but a conservative one. – The Korean Herald/Asia News Network\n",

      "FAIZAL is having a difficult time coping with the Covid-19 pandemic. Previously a Grab ride-hailing driver, he no longer has a reliable income as there are fewer or even no trips at all whenever there is a tightening of the movement control order. He has considered doing motorcycle food delivery but as a family man, found it too competitive and not worth the physical risk. With a wife and three small children to support, he looks forward to things being as they were before as he ponders his immediate future.There is hope on the horizon in the form of the vaccination programme. But Faizal is hesitant about getting him and his wife vaccinated due to concerns about side effects and what it will mean to his children. He wants to wait and see. Meanwhile, the government knows that it needs to vaccinate 80% of the population to achieve a statistical herd immunity nationwide.Vaccine hesitancy is a policy obstacle. There are “anti-vaxxers” even among educated people in advanced countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 global health threats. Among the reasons why people do not want to get vaccinated are safety concerns, religious beliefs, personal philosophical views, and mistrust of authority and of science. So while Faizal wants things to improve and hopes that the government will do something to help him, he does not want to take the vaccine, at least not yet.Nudging behavioursIt turns out that people often make bad choices that lead to self-harm. This is not due to lack of education or some form of mental deficiency, but a typical trait of being human. It is not necessarily a bad thing; it is what makes humans survive and thrive. You can say that humans are constructive and destructive at the same time.What is interesting about this seeming “irrationality” in people is that it is predictable and happens everywhere, whether in America, Europe, Africa or Asia.You can predict the kinds of biases people have and decisions they are likely to make anywhere and everywhere. You can predict people’s expected behaviour and nudge it accordingly.Therefore, policymakers would need to understand behavioural insights when developing and implementing policies that affect the general public. Using these insights, policymakers can nudge behaviours towards a desired outcome that serves a common good.Behavioural insights in economic theoryTraditional economics assumes that people are rational and make decisions based on information, logic and self-interest, that result in a common good. However, behavioural economists, among them Nobel laureates Richard Thaler, Daniel Kahneman, Abhijit Banerjee and Hebert Simon, have shown that humans have certain ways of thinking that shape their choices and the outcomes. Such research has become the foundation of new economic theory that incorporates behavioural insights.Government policymaking based on old school economics tends to be framed around regulation and enforcement, and assumes that the right price, incentives and information will result in successful policies. But when policies do not consider human behaviour, public response may be different from what is expected.Let’s look at some examples. Mandatory recycling by households and businesses introduced a few years back is a policy that has exhausted its options and has since been abandoned. The policy required waste to be sorted into coloured bags (blue for paper; white for plastics; green for glass, cans and other recyclables; yellow for plant waste; and black for food, organic and nonrecyclable waste).People found this complicated. Although there was an awareness programme to educate the public, and despite the authorities issuing warning letters and imposing fines of between RM50 and RM200 (with a threat of raising it to RM1, 000), it was hard to comply with because people had to find and spend money on coloured waste bags, and spend time sorting waste. In terms of behavioural change, it was not habit-forming and didn’t fit into the pace of life. The authorities themselves found that managing and enforcing the policy had become burdensome, too.On the other hand, retailers charging 20 sen for a plastic bag is a policy that has successfully encouraged a shift to reusable bags. The disincentive is small, but it got results.Policymaking with people in mindFailed policies are often blamed on people’s mindsets, which assumes that the policy is inherently good and the problem is the public’s cognitive weakness and negative attitudes.But policy cannot be created in a vacuum without considering human behaviour and the public’s response.What is mindset? It is people’s beliefs, biases and habits that form behaviours. Biases are shaped by people’s self-identity, community and society, of how they see themselves and the people they interact with. People tend to behave like others they identify with.And because people have limited attention spans and willpower, they rely on heuristics to make decisions. Heuristics are guesstimates or rules-of-thumb that people use to compare and contrast things they think they know, to quickly arrive at a choice in their busy world. For example, something that happened to someone becomes an analogy in their thought process. Although heuristics can be flawed, people use them as mental shortcuts to make decisions. Think of it as fuzzy logic, which is flawed but essential to arrive at a solution.Policymakers need to understand the interplay of human behaviours and public response, as it can affect the success or failure of government policies.Sometimes, when things don’t work as intended, policymakers pile up additional regulation and enforcement as quick remedies. It is no good to keep tweaking the wrong policy response. Regulation and enforcement add an administrative and financial burden that may not improve the result. Monetary rewards and penalties and information campaigns can be costly but unproductive. The wrong policy tweaks can lead to policy failure.Nudging behaviours may be a better way to get the right results. It can avoid unnecessary regulation and pouring resources into enforcement. It is cheaper than costly subsidies and incentives. It gives people the freedom to make good choices rather than hurt them with punitive action.This is not to say that regulations, incentives and penalties are not needed. Rather, the goal is to optimise behavioural response within policy implementation.Behavioural nudges can be as simple as the daily messages sent directly to the public through texting platforms, for example, to reassure and remind people about pandemic precautions. It works alongside laws and enforcement of SOPs by the government.Behavioural change as collective policy actionThe Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of behavioural change. Before there was a vaccine, medical science had little to offer in terms of prevention and containment of the virus, save for physical distancing, wearing a mask and washing hands. Now that there are vaccines available, we need people to want to be vaccinated. That too is behavioural change.Indeed, some of our biggest problems, like healthcare and lifestyle diseases, education and social mobility, climate change and environmental protection, require both government and society to come together in some collective action. For that we need to merge behavioural insights into policymaking.Behavioural insights have many applications but are particularly suited to good policymaking. Think of behavioural insights as a way to promote positive civics and ethics through nudging. This can help overcome roadblocks in policy development.Many countries, such as Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Australia and Singapore, have behavioural insights as part of government policy development. In Malaysia, the Economic Planning Unit is encouraging the use of behavioural insights for smarter government policies.To this end, the Malaysia Productivity Corporation (MPC) is working with various ministries and agencies and with knowledge experts and other stakeholders to expand the application of behavioural insights in government and industry. To know more about the practical aspects of nudging behaviours, look at various literature and case studies as well as the activities of the Behavioural Insights Malaysia community group on Facebook that MPC hosts.Eddie Razak is a consultant on social development and public policy, and was a student of Behavioural Insights while at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.

      "There has been no community transmission of the more transmissible Delta Covid-19 variant even if 13 cases had been detected in the country, according to infectious disease expert Edsel Salvana, a member of the technical advisory group of the Department of Health (DOH).“It looks like we have prevented its spread to the community for now, although this is being closely monitored because what the Delta variant has caused in other countries is scary,” Salvana said.Salvana said all 13 individuals were returning travellers, and nine of them were from the Covid-19-stricken vessel Athens Bridge, which was allowed to dock in Manila last month after being refused entry in Vietnam.The doctor stressed the need for caution and compliance with health and quarantine protocols to prevent the spread of the Delta variant, which was first detected in India.The Delta variant, he said, had been found to be 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant and apparently behind the surge in cases in other countries.It also appeared to cause more severe cases of Covid-19, he said, based on his experience caring for four out of the 13 Delta variant cases detected locally, one of whom had died.Also on Friday, the government reset to June 22 – instead of June 16 – the implementation of a shorter, seven-day quarantine for incoming travellers who had been fully vaccinated in the Philippines.This means that such passengers who are arriving before June 22 must still quarantine for 10 days in a facility, take a swab test on the seventh day, and complete a four-day home quarantine.The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) moved the date to complete the setup of a validation process for vaccination certificates, according to presidential spokesman Harry Roque.The IATF earlier said that for these inbound travellers to be allowed to take the shorter quarantine, their vaccination cards must be verified prior to their departure from the Philippines. They must also get a certification from the Department of Information and Communications Technology or the health officer of the local government which administered their last dose of Covid-19 vaccine.The certification must be presented to the Bureau of Quarantine for reverification upon their return to the country.The new rules would also do away with the need for them to take a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, unless they exhibit Covid-19 symptoms. — Philippine Daily Inquirer/ANN\n",

      "WITH Indonesia seeing significant rises in the number of Covid-19 cases in the past weeks, pressure is piling up on the government to impose stricter restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus.The Health Ministry announced a record daily rise in the last four months for two days in a row, with 12,624 and 12,990 new confirmed cases on Thursday and Friday, respectively.While many presumed the high mobility of millions of people during the Aidilfitri holiday season last month had triggered the surge, the situation was likely exacerbated by the Delta coronavirus variant, which was first detected in India and is thought to be more transmissible than other strains.Despite the exponential case spike, authorities are still relying on the micro-scale public activity restrictions (PPKM Mikro) to curb further transmission of the virus, although many criticised the policy for being too lenient.Under the restrictions, neighbourhood units and community units are required to enforce restrictions that best suit their level of risk.The higher the risk of transmission, the tighter the restrictions to be enforced. Public places such as shopping malls are also allowed to operate until 9pm, while restaurants are allowed to have dine-in customers at 50% of their maximum capacity.Under the previous policy of large-scale social restrictions, restaurants were only allowed to serve takeaway and delivery services, while public places were permitted to operate until 7pm.Experts and doctors have urged the government to impose tighter wide-scale restrictions to prevent further transmission, as the country’s healthcare system had been overwhelmed with the high number of Covid-19 patients.Epidemiologist Riris Andono Ahmad of Gadjah Mada University called PPKM Mikro “an illogical policy” from an epidemiology standpoint, as the policy was implemented when cases were already widespread.“The best approach the government can take now is making sure 70% of the population stay home for at least three weeks,” he said.Griffith University epidemiologist Dicky Budiman warned this would be the time for Indonesia “to hit the emergency brake” and impose widespread restrictions in Java and Bali, the country’s two most populous islands, as well as large cities in Sumatra and Kalimantan.“Imposing a lockdown for two weeks is the only way to prevent our healthcare facilities from going into chaos, especially considering other strategies of testing and treatment are still inadequate,” he said. — The Jakarta Post/ANN\n",

      "MANILA, June 19 (Philippines Daily Inquirer/ANN): The Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) reported on Saturday 6, 959 new COVID-19 infections, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the South-East Asian country to 1, 353, 220.The death toll climbed to 23, 538 after 153 more patients died from the viral disease, the DOH said.The Philippines, which has more than 110 million population, has tested more than 13 million people since the outbreak in January 2020.Meanwhile, The government will give overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) the vaccine brand required by their country of destination despite the limited supply of Western-made jabs available in the Philippines.Labour Secretary Silvestre Bello III said some countries had expressed a preference for Pfizer although he did not give any details.He did say, however, that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) had subjected to more stringent quarantine rules workers who had been given Chinese-made vaccines like Sinopharm and Sinovac.To prevent a repeat of last month’s incident in which KSA-bound OFWs were temporarily stopped from leaving Manila, Bello asked the National Task Force Against Covid-19 (NTF) to give OFWs the brand required by their employers.In response, NTF deputy chief Secretary Vivencio Dizon said that due to the country’s limited supply of Pfizer vaccines, the government would prioritize seafarers or land-based OFWs set to leave in four months’ time.On Thursday, about 1, 200 seafarers were given Pfizer shots during an exclusive vaccination organized by manning agency Magsaysay Maritime Corp. and the Manila City government.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, who was at the event, encouraged other agencies and seafarers’ unions to coordinate with local governments for group vaccinations.No violation, favoritism“There’s no violation of ‘equal protection’ [from vaccines], no favoritism ... since [a specific brand] is condition for their employment, ” he said.Dizon said seafarers and OFWs were moved up to the A1 category, the government’s top priority sector which initially included only health workers, to give them the “opportunity to receive COVAX-donated vaccines, like Pfizer.”He said seafarers and OFWs, who were previously categorized as “other essential workers, ” might also get vaccinated through the local governments in their provinces.Aside from Pfizer, Bello said he also wanted OFWs to be given the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccines once these become available locally. - Philippines Daily Inquirer/ANN\n",

      "BANGKOK, June 18 (Reuters): Thailand has abandoned its plan for a 16-week gap between doses of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine and will opt for a shorter interval of 10 to 12 weeks instead, a senior health official has announced.The government, which plans to use the AstraZeneca vaccine for most of its inoculations, had sought to reach more people faster by stretching the gap to 16 weeks, beyond the 12 weeks maximum approved by the European Medicines Agency.A 16-week interval has not been tested in human trials.But Sophon Mekthon, the public health minister's assistant, told Reuters Thailand's communicable disease committee wanted to revert to the previous interval, adding that it could still be extended in future if necessary.Thailand started its mass Covid-19 immunisation campaign last week and has administered 7.2 million doses since February.A royal-owned Thai firm has partnered with AstraZeneca to make its vaccine locally, but has experienced delays, also impacting Taiwan, Malaysia and the Philippines.Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul on Friday said the government would receive 10 million AstraZeneca doses monthly from July until its quota of 61 million doses is met. Thailand has also been using Sinovac's vaccine.The rush for vaccines came as Thailand was hit by its most severe wave of coronavirus infections in early April, months before the start of its immunisation drive.It has secured 105.5 million doses so far and will procure 50 million more next year, authorities have said. - Reuters\n",

      "HONG KONG, June 19 (AFP): Two executives from Hong Kong's pro-democracy Apple Daily appeared in court on Saturday on charges of collusion and were denied bail after authorities deployed a sweeping security law to target the newspaper, a scathing critic of Beijing.Chief editor Ryan Law and CEO Cheung Kim-hung are accused of colluding with foreign forces to undermine China's national security over a series of articles that police said called for international sanctions.Chief magistrate Victor So said there were insufficient grounds \"for the court to believe that the defendants will not continue to commit acts endangering national security\".The two will remain in custody until their next court appearance on August 13 as prosecutors said police needed time to examine more than 40 computers and 16 servers seized from the newsroom.The case is the first time political views and opinions published by a Hong Kong media outlet have triggered the security law, which was imposed last year by Beijing to stamp out dissent in the financial hub.Apple Daily and its jailed owner Jimmy Lai have long been thorns in Beijing's side, with unapologetic support for the city's pro-democracy movement and caustic criticism of China's authoritarian leaders.More than 500 police officers raided the paper's newsroom on Thursday. Five executives were arrested. Law and Cheung were charged on Friday while the three others were released on bail pending further investigations.\"We will continue to publish our paper tomorrow,\" deputy chief editor Chan Pui-man said outside court. She was released late Friday on bail.Dozens of supporters were queuing to get seats in court on Saturday morning, including many former and current employees of Apple Daily.A staff member, who gave her surname as Chang, said she and many other Apple Daily employees treat \"every day like it is our last\" working for the paper.\"At first, authorities said the national security law would only target a tiny number of people,\" she told AFP.\"But what has happened showed us that is nonsense,\" she added.Another staff reporter, who gave her first name as Theresa, said she felt Apple Daily's legal troubles were a warning shot.\"I think what has happened to Apple Daily today can eventually happen to every other news outlet in the city,\" she said.- Plunging press freedom -Multiple international media companies have regional headquarters in Hong Kong, attracted to the business-friendly regulations and free speech provisions written into the city's mini-constitution.But many are now questioning whether they have a future there and are drawing up contingency plans as Beijing presses on with a broad crackdown on dissent in the city.Local media have an even tougher time, with journalist associations saying reporters are increasingly having to self-censor.Hong Kong has steadily plunged down an annual press freedom ranking by Reporters Without Borders, from 18th place in 2002 to 80th this year.Mainland China languishes at 177th out of 180, above only Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea.Hong Kong and Chinese officials say the arrests were not an attack on the media.Earlier this week, security secretary John Lee described Apple Daily as a \"criminal syndicate\".Apple Daily is by far the most outspoken of Hong Kong's pro-democracy media outlets. But it is not clear how long it can survive.Its wealthy owner Lai, 73, is currently serving multiple jail sentences for his involvement in democracy rallies in 2019.He has also been charged under the national security law and has had his Hong Kong assets frozen.Authorities froze a further HK$18 million (US$2.3 million) of Apple Daily's company assets on Thursday.Police say they also plan to prosecute three companies owned by Apple Daily under the security law, which could see the paper fined or banned.It is the first time companies, rather than an individual, have faced a national security investigation.Mark Simon, an aide to Lai who lives overseas, said the paper would have difficulty paying its staff of about 700.Company lawyers were trying to work out the breadth of the asset freeze order, he added.\"Money is not an issue. Draconian orders from Beijing via the NSL (national security law) are the issue,\" he told AFP. - AFP\n",

      "KUANTAN (Bernama): The National Recovery Plan tabled by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin on Tuesday (June 15), was not drafted or implemented hastily, says Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah (pic).The Communications and Multimedia Minister said the plan, comprising four phases from June to the end of this year, was carefully worked out as an extension of various programmes implemented by the government since the country was hit by the Covid-19 pandemic early last year.In addition, he said, the three threshold indicators to move from one phase to the next, namely the number of daily infections, intensive care unit (ICU) bed occupancy rate and vaccination rate would enable appropriate approaches and strategies to be implemented.\"In terms of planning, we will still try to find the balance between health safety and economic survival and our stance has not changed since March 2020... the only thing is that during the first movement control order, the strategy was different from the current situation.\"The same goes in terms of the economic component... this was not thought of a few days before the announcement was made and it is still being drafted under the 6R National Economic Recovery Strategy as presented by the Minister of Finance (Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz) earlier,\" he told a virtual press conference, here, on Saturday (pic).Saifuddin said the framework and plan were based on striking a balance between health and survival, the core of the implementation of various initiatives to help the people since 2020, such as the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package (Prihatin); National Economic Recovery Plan (Penjana); the Malaysian Economic and Rakyat's Protection Scheme (Permai).In addition, the government's strategic planning and approach to tackle Covid-19 based on data and science, according to Saifuddin, had also prevented the health system from collapsing, taking into account the number of cases could have reached 15, 000 cases by the middle of this month had the nationwide lockdown's first phase not been enforced.\"Every figure used since the beginning of the pandemic, including the Covid-19 daily cases, were the actual number, they were not made up or created because the government is transparent and does not hide anything at all,\" he said.Saifuddin, who is Indera Mahkota MP, is also confident that each phase of the National Recovery Plan can be achieved according to the schedule provided if there is cooperation between the government, the private sector and the people.Elaborating, he also referred to other efforts to improve vaccination rates such as the Federal Territories Ministry’s move in setting up mobile vaccination centres at people's housing schemes and the public-private partnership immunisation programme (Pikas) by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.\"The Covid-19 Vaccine Supply Access Guarantee Special Committee (JKJAV) is also working hard to increase the number of vaccine recipients through various outreach programmes including at mosques and rural areas... these are all important for us to achieve the set threshold value.\"However, we also need the cooperation of the public to register and agree to receive the vaccine as well as continue to adhere to the standard operating procedures (SOP), because if there is a spike in the number of daily cases, we will not be able to move on to the next phase, even if the vaccination rate meets the threshold value,\" he said.- Bernama\n",

      "A probable downward revision in growth prospects notwithstanding, the National Recovery Plan brings much certainty to an economic landscape deeply affected by the pandemicON Wednesday, the day after the announcement of the National Recovery Plan (NRP), the local stock market hardly stirred.The benchmark index closed up a mere two points or 0.12%, indicating that investors still remain fluid to the developments that surround the disease and also the economy.Feeling sanguine would be appropriate when the key indicators start moving, but for now, having thresholds and targets is something that at least gives grounds for some clarity.While the NRP is a good plan, it hinges on things that are still not within anyone’s control, such as the number of Covid-19 admissions into the intensive care unit or ICU and daily infection rates.But those in support of the plan say that it brings much certainty into an economic landscape that has been pummeled by the pandemic.“At least now there is a guide as to when we can open up. This goes some way in helping businesses plan for things like hiring new personnel and ramping up production or taking new orders. But the key is in execution, ” says one fund manager referring to vaccination targets.Going by the NRP, all economic sectors will be allowed to operate by the end of October 2021, provided more than 60% of the population is vaccinated with two doses. In addition, daily Covid-19 cases must be below 500.Judging by the recent numbers, that is some way to go before this is achieved.Reported daily Covid-19 cases this week were more than 5, 000. The good news is that it is a drop from the 9, 020 figure on May 29.A total of 4.9 million people or about 15% of the population have received at least one vaccine dose.Daily vaccinations have hit a new high of more than 215, 000 shots and expectations is that daily vaccination shots will increase to between 200, 000 and 250, 000 in July, and then hit 300, 000 to 400, 000 shots daily.Going by the NRP’s targets, 60% of the population should have their double doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of October.Observers point out that this is an ambitious target, especially should there be a delay in securing vaccines, highlighted by the hold-up in receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.Kenanga Research points out that in the best-case scenario, Malaysia could achieve “the 80% herd immunity target” as early as Dec 7, but lists out the steps that need to be taken.“To make this possible, Malaysia essentially needs to secure more Covid-19 vaccine supplies and deliveries and establish more Covid-19 vaccine centres, especially in rural areas. More manpower to effectively execute the process of vaccinating the public is also needed, ” Kenanga Research points out.Malaysia has three main vaccines approved for use, namely, Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Sinovac, all of which require two doses for maximum protection.This week, the government granted conditional approval for the emergency use of the single-dose Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by China’s CanSino Biologics and the United States drugmaker Johnson & Johnson.A fund manager points out that the government might want to consider fully opening the economy as early as September by ensuring that more people get their first dose, an approach adopted in the United Kingdom, Germany and Singapore.He also suggests the government look into alternative solutions to reduce the daily infection rate.“We can’t just depend on vaccinations alone since there are issues that could delay the process such as supply disruptions and new variants.“The UK is seeing a spike in new cases due to the delta variant, although about 80% of its adult population has received at least the first dose of the vaccine, ” he points out.Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid says that the NRP provides a clear timeline and a guide to reopening.“The public can then manage their expectations for what might happen between phases and take the necessary action to avoid any calamities, ” he tells StarBizWeek.Socio-Economic Research Centre (SERC) executive director Lee Heng Guie says the NRP should incorporate the kind of assistance the government is planning to help affected industries throughout the recovery period.“The stimulus packages we have now only focuses on the one-month lockdown. The government should also consider providing assistance for at least the next three to six months, especially for sectors that are not allowed to operate until the fourth phase, ” he says.The government has imposed a lockdown from June 1 to June 28 to be followed by a less stringent lockdown that will be divided into phases under the NRP.Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz says that the government is reviewing all existing measures and could introduce additional assistance to support the affected people and businesses, especially for economic sectors that would not be allowed to operate until the fourth phase.Lower GDP growth expectationsThe biggest drawback from the lockdown is its impact on the economy. Some economists estimate the one-month lockdown will shave off more than 2% of the country’s economic growth.Afzanizam is of the view that the country’s 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast should be revised lower.“Putting a cap on production capacity would have a negative impact on economic activity.“We have revised our 2021 GDP forecast to 4.2% from 5% previously, ” he says.SERC’s Lee has maintained his forecast of 4% GDP growth for this year.Malaysia’s central bank expects the economy to expand 6%-7.5% this year.On Thursday, Tengku Zafrul highlighted that the current lockdown was costing economic losses of RM1bil a day, but the amount would be reduced in the coming phases.That is far lower than the first round of the lockdown last year, which had cost the economy RM2.4bil a day and dragged the country’s GDP for April-June 2020 to its worst level since 1998.Not all analysts are cutting their forecasts as the current lockdown is less debilitating than the MCO 1.0 last year.Kenanga Research expects the impact of the current lockdown to be less severe than last year, as consumers and businesses are more prepared.The research house has maintained its GDP forecast for this year at 5%-6%, but sees the need to inject additional fiscal stimulus to aid economic recovery. “The retail sector will remain pressured in the near term, as consumer activities would be weighed by the tightened mobility restrictions and closure of non-essential stores, ” the research house says.SERC’s Lee points out that external demand provides a buffer to the economy as domestic demand wanes.“While strong export demand could partially offset weak domestic demand, there are some exporters affected by the lockdown, ” he explains.Malaysia’s exports increased 63% year-on-year (y-o-y) in April to RM105.6bil, driven by manufactured goods of electrical and electronic products. These include semiconductors used in 5G technology and high-performance computing, as well as rubber products.Afzanizam points out that while the export-oriented industries are seen to be the immediate beneficiaries in the global recovery, the momentum has been disrupted due to the recent lockdown.He expects the economy to accelerate in 2022 as domestic demand picks up with sectors such as tourism, airlines, food and beverage, and entertainment to be the immediate beneficiaries.“M1, which is money in circulation, and demand deposits have been growing quite steeply since the pandemic erupted in March last year. What it means is that there is a lot of cash in the hands of the public.“Therefore, should the economy fully reopen next year, we can expect private consumption to return to a more healthy level, driving GDP growth into a higher trajectory, ” he says.Strategic action for the economyIndustry players are suggesting that the NRP ought to include a detailed strategy for businesses.Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai says businesses need help on how to plan their survival strategy, as the prolonged period of non-operation has severely impacted their viability.“Some would have to make hard and painful decisions if there is no clear indication on when they would be allowed to resume operations.“FMM has called on the government to allow export-based businesses and those in crucial supply chains as well as smaller sized companies to resume operations, ” he says.FMM points out that under the current lockdown, almost 80% of businesses fall into the non-essential category and are therefore not allowed to operate.And for the businesses that are allowed to operate, only a 60% operational capacity is allowed.To expedite vaccination among the private sector, the government has also announced a public-private partnership (PPP) immunisation initiative dubbed the Public-Private Partnership Industrial Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pikas).Under the programme, which has been tasked to the International Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti), the government will provide the vaccines but participating companies are required to fully bear administration costs for their employees.Many quarters are now highlighting the importance of vaccination as the key to exit the Covid-19 crisis.However, it can’t be the only strategy as there are also other risks that can slow down the vaccination process such as logistics, hiccups in supply and new variants.The government should also consider looking at other alternatives to achieve its NRP timeline as a longer lockdown can be damaging to the economy.It will be a winding road to recovery but the NRP roadmap would guide the economy in the right direction.As the country raises its hope that the targets of the NRP are met, yesterday’s Covid-19 cases sent a grim reminder of the challenges ahead. With 6, 440 new cases, it still remains above the 4, 000-threshold that is essential to start the recovery plan.\n",

      "CASH-RICH Greatech Technology Bhd, whose latest first-quarter sales surged by over 80% year-on-year, believes that the best is yet to come.With over two decades of experience in automating factories globally, the Penang-based company has set out plans to grow its footprint even further by acquiring new companies, boosting production capacity and expanding the range of its product offerings.The group, which has been highly-reliant on the solar industry for orders, also wants to widen its revenue base by increasing its presence in other product segments such as semiconductors and sensors as well as life sciences.A quick check on its 2020 annual report showed that over 95% of its topline were contributed by only three clients. In fact, almost 61% of total revenue is attributed to one undisclosed client.Hence, it is unsurprising that Greatech seeks to widen its revenue base, considering the need to minimise the risk of relying on very few customers.In the near future, Greatech expects its electric vehicle (EV) energy storage segment to be a major contributor to revenue, potentially overtaking the solar segment. This, however, does not mean that the contribution from the solar segment will begin to reduce.Over the next two years, Greatech executive director and CEO Tan Eng Kee foresees the EV energy storage and solar segments to remain strong.“Based on current global development, we believe the renewable energy segment will have a bigger potential growth for Greatech, especially in the EV energy storage segment as this is an emerging technology and market,” he tells StarBizWeek.Earlier this month, concerns emerged on the group’s EV energy storage business, after one of its largest customers – Lordstown Motor Corp – was reported to have been facing cash constraints to commence full commercial production.However, in a reply to StarBiz earlier, Tan described the issue as “small and manageable” and said that Greatech expects to continue doing business with the US-based electric pick-up truck start-up Lordstown Motor.Tan added that Greatech’s contract with Lordstown Motor would expire in September and it is expected to be renewed in one or two months.“They (Lordstown) have said that their business will continue amid the latest developments, ” he said.PublicInvest Research, in a note on July 11, also said it was not “overly concerned” on Greatech’s payment collection from Lordstown, as Greatech had managed to collect an additional RM80mil from the buyer within three months.Meanwhile, the recent newsflow about US-based solar panel maker First Solar Inc planning to invest US$680mil (RM2.8bil) in a new factory in Ohio is also expected to benefit Greatech, says Tan.First Solar is a major client for Greatech. Although the group has declined to disclose revenue contributions from First Solar, it is noteworthy that Greatech has a long-standing relationship with the company and in the financial year 2018 (FY18), First Solar group of companies accounted for almost 88% of Greatech’s revenue, based on its listing prospectus.“Ongoing discussion with First Solar for the new plant in Ohio is actively taking place.“We are not able to comment much on this at the moment pending the finalisation of the deal with the customer,” he adds.First Solar’s new Ohio plant is expected to have a capacity to produce up to 3GW worth of solar panels annually, with target completion of the plant in early-2023.Tan points out that the group’s order book value stood at RM293mil as of April 9, and this is expected to provide earnings visibility until the first half of 2022.Supported by the continued growth in the EV energy storage and solar segments, Tan expects 2023 to be the “best year for Greatech”.Tan is the single largest shareholder with an equity interest of 68% in Greatech. Along with Khor Lean Heng, who is Greatech’s executive director and chief operating officer, Tan established the group back in 1997.Guided by three-year planLooking ahead, Tan says that Greatech has established a “three-year plan” to diversify into other segments.Following this, the group has also embarked on increased spending for research and development (R&D) efforts to expand its product range.In the financial year of 2020 (FY20), the group has spent about RM9.3mil for R&D, and as for the current FY21, it has allocated about RM12mil.Backed by its strong cash position, Greatech says that it is actively looking to acquire strategic fit foreign companies as it seeks to expand its market presence internationally. Tan points out that the companies would likely be in the life sciences and the EV energy storage segments.As of end-March 2021, the group’s cash and cash equivalents stood at RM312.82mil, against total borrowings of just RM18.27mil.Emphasis on research and development“Additionally, Greatech is also actively involved in development of new products in emerging markets whereby we foresee the R&D cost will increase year over year.“The group has allocated internally generated funds of RM77mil for capital expenditure in FY21, of which RM50mil is allocated for land and construction of new facility in Batu Kawan, Penang while the remaining balance of RM27mil is for the investment of machinery, equipment and information technology.“The group is currently assessing the capacity of the existing plants and may utilise its cash position to increase and accelerate the assembly capacity and the investment of machinery for fabrication capacity,” says Tan.For a high-growth company like Greatech, Tan says its biggest challenge is talent development, where a large team of engineers is required to implement the group’s “three-year plan”.“Hence, the group has established the Young Engineering Programme (YEP) to train and develop the graduate engineers as a measure to build a capable and focus-driven talent pool for the group,” he points out.Commenting on Greatech’s financial performance outlook, Tan strongly believes that FY21 will be a “positive and strong” year for the group.Greatech began its FY21 on a strong footing after its first quarter ended March 31 reported a 80.4% increase in revenue to RM95.14mil, as compared to RM52.74mil a year earlier.The increase was mainly attributable to the higher revenue recognised for production line systems supplied to the electric vehicle (EV) energy storage industry.Meanwhile, the net profit in the first quarter surged by 2.5 times year-on-year to RM46.62mil.The stronger bottomline was mainly due to the increased reversal of unused provision for warranties of RM8.49mil made in the prior years as well as the favourable gross margin mix benefits realised from engineering design works.Greatech reported a 51.9% gross profit margin for the first quarter ended March 31.“Excluding the effects of net reversal of unused provision for warranties of RM5.23mil and net provision for warranties of RM2.90mil, the normalised gross profit margin would be 46.41% and 45.17% for this quarter and prior year corresponding quarter respectively,” the group said earlier in its results filing.Greatech’s initial public offering in June 2019 was one of the best-performing liftings on Bursa Malaysia in recent years. In a span of two years, from an offer price of just 61 sen, the stock has risen to RM5.64 per share as of yesterday.\n",

      "LONDON: British supermarket group Morrisons has rejected a proposed 5.52 billion pound ($7.62 billion or RM31.54bil) cash offer from U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), saying it is far too low.Britain's fourth largest grocer by sales after Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, said it received the \"unsolicited, highly conditional non-binding\" proposal of 230 pence a share on Monday.The board of Bradford, northern England-based Morrisons rejected the proposal on Thursday.\"The board of Morrisons evaluated the conditional proposal together with its financial adviser, Rothschild & Co, and unanimously concluded that the conditional proposal significantly undervalued Morrisons and its future prospects,\" the group said in a statement on Saturday.Shares in Morrisons, down 5.5% over the last year, closed on Friday at 182 pence, valuing the group at 4.33 billion pounds.Morrisons said CD&R's proposal provided for Morrisons shareholders to also still receive a final ordinary dividend of 5.11 pence per share announced on March 11.CD&R had earlier on Saturday said it was considering a possible cash offer for Morrisons.Under British takeover rules CD&R has until July 17 to announce a firm intention to make an offer.APPETITE FOR SUPERMARKETSCD&R's approach underlines private equity's growing appetite for UK supermarket assets, attracted by their cash generation and freehold assets.In February, Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital purchased a majority stake in Asda from Walmart in a deal valuing the UK supermarket group at 6.8 billion pounds.That deal followed Sainsbury's failure to take over Asda after an agreed deal was blocked by Britain's competition regulator in 2019.Morrisons has a partnership agreement with Amazon and there has been speculation it could emerge as a possible bidder.A formal bid from CD&R could involve Terry Leahy, the former Tesco CEO who is a senior adviser to CD&R.When at Tesco, Leahy was the boss of Andrew Higginson and David Potts, who are now Morrisons' chairman and CEO respectively.Morrisons, unique among British supermarket groups in making over half of the fresh food it sells, trades from about 500 stores and has 118, 000 staff, making it one of the country's biggest private sector employers.In March, the group reported a halving of annual profit due largely to costs incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, but forecast a bounce back in the 2021-22 year.Earlier this month, Morrisons was rebuked by investors over executive pay, with more than 70% of votes cast at its annual shareholders' meeting rejecting its pay report. - Reuters\n",

      "NEW YORK: The Federal Reserve's hawkish shift is forcing investors to reevaluate the rally in so-called value stocks, which have taken a hit in recent days after ripping higher for most of the year.Shares of banks, energy firms and other companies that tend to be sensitive to the economy’s fluctuations have tumbled following the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, when the central bank surprised investors by anticipating two quarter-percentage-point rate increases in 2023 amid a recent surge in inflation.The Russell 1000 Value Stock Index is down 4% from its June peak, though still up 13.2% this year. Its growth counterpart is up 9.1% year-to-date.One factor driving the move is the idea that a Fed more strongly focused on preventing the economy from overheating may begin unwinding easy-money policies sooner than previously expected. On Friday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the central bank’s shift was a \"natural\" response to economic growth and inflation moving quicker than expected, bolstering that view.\"Value stocks had gotten ahead of themselves, particularly in energy and financials, and the folks that are caught offsides are starting to unwind those trades, ” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.The post-Fed meeting slide in value has been accompanied by a retreat in some commodity prices, a surge in the dollar and a rally in U.S. government bonds that dragged down yields on the benchmark U.S. Treasury to around 1.44% on Friday afternoon.Investors will be keeping a close eye on next week’s economic data for clues on whether the recent surge in inflation -- which saw consumer prices accelerate at their fastest pace in 12 years last month -- will persist.New home sales and mortgage applications are due out June 23, while May consumer spending numbers are expected on June 25.Investors piled into value stocks in the latter half of 2020, as signs of breakthroughs in vaccines against COVID-19 bolstered the case for a powerful economic rebound in 2021. Value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by nearly 7 percentage points since the start of November 2020, bucking a trend that saw technology and other growth sectors regularly outshine value over the last decade.An unwinding of the heavy positioning in value shares could exacerbate the recent slide. Mutual funds are overweight value names to a larger degree than any time in the last eight years, according to a Goldman Sachs report published on June 9.Some big-name investors such as Cathie Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF was the top-performing U.S. equity fund last year, have suggested that growth stocks will resume their market outperformance as investors rotate away from value sectors such as energy that are up 38.5% since the start of the year. Wood’s flagship ETF is down 4.8% year-to-date.Others, however, believe the recent wobble in value stocks is a pause, rather than a turning point.Cyclical companies remain the least over-valued in the U.S. stock market, according to Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. High sales-growth companies are trading at valuations nearly double their 10-year averages, while cyclical companies are trading at valuations approximately 40% more than their historical levels, he wrote in a research note.The prospect of rising interest rates should also benefit higher quality value stock names that held up better in last year's downturn but have lagged during the recovery, said John Mowrey, chief investment officer at NFJ Investment Group.He has been increasing his positions in utility and consumer staples stocks that have underperformed value stocks as a whole, betting that they will increase their dividend payouts, which would make them more attractive even if Treasury yields eventually rise.Among his holdings are consumer companies Church & Dwight Co, which is down 4% for the year to date, and McCormick & Company Inc, which is down 9.7% for the year to date. \"The idea of dividend growth has been largely sidelined because we’ve all been enjoying stock appreciation,\" he said. \"We think this will be the next leg of the value stock rally.\" - Reuters\n",

      "NEW YORK: U.S. bank stocks are morphing from leaders into losers amid more signs that their searing 35% rally through this year’s first five months may have outrun the fundamentals.With two weeks left in the quarter, some investors aren’t waiting around to find out. The S&P 500 Banks Index, which rose three times more than the broad market through May, slid 8.1% this past week and more than 10% so far this month. This left indexes of the largest U.S. diversified lenders and regional banks ranking among June’s worst performers, with Citigroup Inc.’s drop of 14% leading its money-center peers and Regions Financial Corp. slumping 17%.The selloff coincides with the plateauing of earnings estimates and a rotation into growth stocks from value. It didn’t help that leaders of the biggest banks started the week by warning about a slump in trading revenue. Without stronger lending and a boost from higher interest rates, earnings probably won’t pick up.\"I am troubled by the lack of supporting data on these companies, ” veteran bank analyst Dick Bove of Odeon Capital Group said in an email early in the week. Multiples were reaching 10-year highs, Bove said, even though \"there is no evidence to date that this recovery is underway.”JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank, set the tone on Monday when Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned that net interest income will be lower than previously anticipated, and that second-quarter trading revenue would be 38% below where it was a year ago. A similar message from Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason sent the lender spiraling by as much as 5% on Wednesday.Trading is more important to the big money-center institutions that run investment banks, but sluggish loan growth has also been a drag, and that’s central to the fortunes of regional banks. Profits have been helped by releasing reserves that had been set aside to cover loan losses that never materialized, thanks to massive federal stimulus programs that kept defaults at bay, but those releases are one-shot gains.Loans bring in earnings that are more repeatable, but Bove said the industry’s commercial loan volume is \"at recession levels, ” with home mortgages on bank books shrinking and credit-card loans under pressure. Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan offered a more upbeat assessment on Bloomberg TV Thursday, saying that demand was starting to pick up -- \"better than it was last fall or coming into the early spring.”Low rates help borrowers but tend to narrow profit margins for lenders. For now, it appears that not even Wednesday’s surprise that Federal Reserve officials anticipate two rate increases by the end of 2023 will be enough to push banks higher.Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said banks can be more profitable even with tight net interest margins if they can do more business because the economy is robust. The pitfall, he said, is that \"there’s a lot of money sloshing around without great places to put it, ” keeping the pressure on margins.\"Careful what you wish for, ” Sosnick said. \"If you want easy money, the problem is it becomes plentiful, and if you’re the one who has it, it’s harder to get a good price for it.”Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital Markets said bank stocks should be bought on weakness because loan growth will come after companies and individuals use up their liquidity. What’s more, credit quality is strong and margins could improve next year as short-term rates rise. \"Combine that with increased loan growth, the revenue growth picture could turn out to be very positive for the banks in 2022, ” he said.One potentially positive catalyst are the pending results from regulatory stress tests, which could open the spigot for more dividends and buybacks. Analysts are confident the banks will have no problem passing. \"If the banks do well, as they’re expected to, the banks will start announcing dividend increases and share buybacks, ” said Arnold Kakuda, who follows bank stocks for Bloomberg Intelligence.\"The ping-pong match continues between macro hopes and current fundamental realities, ” Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin said. \"Fundamentals matter -- until they don’t.” - Bloomberg\n",

      "SOME consumer, tourism and hospitality-related stocks have been on a tear over the last few months, as investors expect these industries to recover should vaccination programmes prove to be the elixir to the pandemic.This was despite stock markets around the world taking a dive after the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) hinted that the first interest rate hike could come faster than expected.The Fed is targetting at least one rate hike in 2023, and another five in 2024 after the central bank upped its gross domestic product (GDP) estimate for 2021 to 7%.The unprecedented outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020 and the measures put in place to curb its spread hit the tourism and hospitality sectors the hardest.A good indicator is the airline industry, which lost a lot of money last year.In the US, investors are hoping for a return to domestic travel, driven by vaccine rollouts and a slowdown in lockdowns.American Airlines’ stock has jumped 49% since the beginning of the year, while United Airlines has gained 30%, Delta Air is up 15% and Southwest Airlines has risen by some 23%.Back home, the local stock market has been on a downtrend since the beginning of the year.The benchmark FBM KLCI is down more than 3% year-to-date, closing at 1, 571.09 points yesterday.Some of the tourism-related stocks have outperformed the index. Shares in AirAsia Bhd have risen more than 5% since the start of the year, while Genting Bhd is up 13.4% and Berjaya Corp Bhd skyrocketing 52% this year.Meanwhile, Avillion Bhd, a hotel operator, saw its share price double from eight sen on May 31 to 17 sen on June 11, a day before the National Recovery Plan (NRP) was announced.Although these industries are unlikely to be fully operational by November, an analyst says the NRP provides a clear path of recovery for the economy.“However, political uncertainties have affected the market sentiment.“Retail participants have also declined compared to last year, as more investors are looking for clarity on the benefits of the NRP to the economy, ” the analyst adds.Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of equity sales Vincent Lau reckons that investors have already been looking at recovery-related stocks such as banking, oil and gas, plantation and tourism.He expects the stock market to pick up pace in the third quarter of this year as the recovery stage of the NRP takes place.“Despite having a clear roadmap from the government’s plan to fully open the economy by the end of October, there are still uncertainties, especially on the number of daily infections, ” he says.On a more positive note, he adds, “Overall, it is a good roadmap and the opening of the economy could be sooner than expected.”RHB Research analyst Soong Wei Siang expects consumer spending to recover sooner than expected in the second half of this year driven by a ramp-up in vaccinations from the third quarter onward.“Considering the current ultra-low interest rate environment with the overnight policy rate expected to be maintained at 1.75% for the rest of 2021, coupled with the assistance packages rolled out by the government, we think consumption will continue to be supported, ” he says in a report.Soong reckons that there are more opportunities in the small to medium-capitalised companies. But large caps have their attraction as well.“The larger-cap consumer names have strong defensive qualities which make them better positioned to mitigate against near-term market risks, ” he adds.Among his top picks for consumer counters include MR DIY Group (M) Bhd, Guan Chong Bhd, MyNews Holdings Bhd, Berjaya Food Bhd and Leong Hup International Bhd.But Kenanga Research expects the retail sector to remain under some level of stress.The research house points out that in the near term, consumer activity would continue to be weighed by the tightened mobility restrictions and the closure of non-essential services.“Nonetheless, we believe the impact would be less severe as consumers and businesses are more prepared with a greater shift towards online sales platforms, ” it says, adding that the situation is expected to gradually recover as the nation shifts to phase two and phase three of the NRP.CGS-CIMB expects investors to shift their portfolio in favour of recovery stocks in the period leading to the third phase of the recovery and Budget 2022.“The government revealed that it will have a supply of 16 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines by end-July.“When added to the current vaccine supply in the country of around 7.6 million doses, this means it will have at least 23.6 million doses of vaccines, sufficient to vaccinate 11.8 million people or 45% of the target population of 26 million to achieve herd immunity.“If these targets are successfully met, we expect investors to shift their portfolios in favour of recovery stocks, ” it said in a note to clients.Among its top picks are Malayan Banking Bhd, Genting Bhd and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd.It added that Malaysia could potentially hold elections in Sarawak, which is due in September, and also the 15th General Election if the current political impasse is not resolved.\n",

      "IT is less than a fortnight until the closing date of Bank Negara’s digital bank licence application and the heat it is generating is intense.Companies are now scrambling to meet the deadline of the application on June 30, which is just 11 days away. It is set to be a crowded race as the central bank will issue only up to five licences.Bank Negara has previously said that about 40 parties have registered their interests to apply for the licences, of which it is only looking at issuing up to five by the first quarter of next year.Only a handful of companies have openly stated their interests such as telecommunications giant Axiata Group Bhd, which is partnering RHB Bank Bhd; Sunway Bhd; AirAsia Group Bhd through its card-based money app BigPay; tech firm Green Packet Bhd; and the Sarawak state government.But as the deadline approaches, more names are starting to surface, including that of conglomerates who are not in the banking or financial services sectors.State-owned energy company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is the heavyweight in the ring, after it emerged alongside other names such as Genting Bhd and New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea Ltd, which is partnering infrastructure conglomerate YTL Corp Bhd, according to recent reports.Sea is a Singaporean tech giant that holds one of the four Singapore digital banking licences. It also owns game developer Garena, Shopee and digital payment system SeaMoney.StarBizWeek gathers from market talks that other names which have since come to light are MyEG Services Bhd, a local investment bank, AEON Credit Service (M) Bhd, United States-based fintech startup MoneyLion and Malaysian fintech firm Soft Space Sdn Bhd.The fear of missing out is overwhelming, to the point a senior officer of Bank Negara has to remind all applicants to respect the application process.In a YouTube talk show by Fintech Fireside Asia on Thursday, the central bank’s financial development and innovation director Suhaimi Ali said there were “a lot of people trying to use connections” to get a headstart in the application process and he has laid down the final word – stop lobbying.“One message to all potential applicants out there is to stop lobbying. And because at Bank Negara, we abide by a strict governance process in assessing applications.“I would like all parties to respect that process,” he says.Suhaimi adds that there is a significant amount of interest from non-banks but regardless if a consortium is bank-led or not, each submission will be assessed equally.The red-hot interest in the digital banking space is understandable, considering that this could be the only type of banking licence that will be issued by Bank Negara, at least for now, more than 20 years post-Asian Financial Crisis when banks with smaller capitals were required to consolidate.Besides RHB Bank, it does not seem like other conventional banks are interested in applying for the licence, except for CIMB Group Holdings Bhd probably, which has been making great strides on the digital front through its wholly-owned subsidiary Touch ‘n Go Sdn Bhd, which owns 51% in TNG Digital Sdn Bhd, the joint-venture company with China’s Ant Group that runs the Touch ‘n Go eWallet.Unless the brick-and-mortar banks are open to explore partnerships on the digital front, they do not need a digital bank licence because they are allowed to digitalise their current operations using their existing licence.Meanwhile, MyEG, which is primarily involved in providing e-services for the government, confirms that it will be applying for a digital banking licence.In an email response to StarBizWeek, the company said it is applying as a part of a consortium, the composition of which will be disclosed at the end of the month.“At MyEG, we believe that technology can transform banking and financial services. With our 21 years of experience and track record in harnessing the power of technology to bring essential government services to the masses in the most reliable, efficient and affordable manner, we are confident that we are in a prime position to leverage our insights and expertise to do the same for banking.“Digital banking services would be complementary and synergistic as well as a value-add to MyEG’s range of existing e-government and commercial service offerings,” it says.MyEG adds that in aligning with Bank Negara’s objectives to provide banking services to the underserved and unserved markets, the group already has a long and established track record in engaging these very same markets, given its vast existing user base that spans all levels of society, income levels and age groups, with a geographical reach that stretches to all corners of the country, even to the rural and interior areas.Besides Petronas, it is learnt that an oil and gas services company is, or was, interested in joining the fray, at least until its auditors pointed out some matters pertaining to statutory audit.Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd, which was in the limelight recently over the accounting queries of about RM3bil transactions by its auditor KPMG, is also said to be among those wanting to apply, although its latest stance is not immediately known.The company declined to comment if it is planning to enter the digital banking space.While Reuters recently reported that gaming firm Razer Inc is considering applying, sources tell StarBizWeek that the Singapore-based company is not.In a media briefing on Berjaya Corp Bhd’s (BCorp’s) strategic transformation plan on Tuesday, group managing director Jalil Rasheed said Razer Fintech did look at digital banking but did not find the right partners to do it.Razer Fintech is the financial technology arm of Razer Inc, of which BCorp holds a 49% stake through its wholly-owned subsidiary Berjaya Fintech Sdn Bhd.It partnered BCorp in 2018 to roll out the Razer Pay e-wallet in Malaysia.MIDF head of research Imran Yassin Md Yusof tells StarBizWeek it is not surprising to see many parties from various sectors interested in this, as it gives them the opportunity to enter the banking space since it is very unlikely for new traditional banking licences to be issued.“With the proliferation of technology usage, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, we expect that digital banking has a bright future.“It also allows for the setting up of a bank without having to invest heavily in the cost associated with setting up a bank such as the cost to develop a branch network.“For those that already have some bank-like products such as e-wallet providers, it also means that more products can be offered and these parties can utilise the ‘deposits’ more efficiently,” he says.MIDF Research believes that digital banks will compete with traditional banks over the long term.“Having said that, it is not that traditional banks will not be competitive in the future as their existing licences already allow them to offer their products digitally.“The shift will likely be on how customers perform their banking needs and the strategies that banks employ to meet these needs,” says Imran, adding that the research house believes more customers will shift towards digital channels to perform their banking and it is likely this will lead to more branch network rationalisation, for instance.The most recent one came from HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd, which is closing down 13 branches in Malaysia by the year-end to focus on digital banking.In fact, if one were to take a step back to observe the industry statistics in Malaysia, it seems that banks are cognisant that their writings are on the wall if they do not change.Over the past 10 years, there has been an 11.14% decrease in bank branches from 2,055 to 1,826, a 20.74% drop in staff to 100,175 people and a reduction of automated teller machines (ATMs) and cash deposit machines by 29% and 82.5%, respectively, in the push for a cashless society.Vision Group managing director Chua Zhu Lian says corporations are looking into digital banking to pursue business diversification strategies, given that the Covid-19 situation has significantly impacted core businesses which has previously been thought of as resilient, even under worst-case scenarios.“There are also corporations that are looking to secure the licence to offer their users a more comprehensive set of services in order to strengthen their market position and expand their revenue streams into banking or financial services.“I believe conventional banks and new digital banks will co-exist as everyone in the ecosystem has an important role to play.“We will certainly see greater product innovations originating from both conventional and digital players, which will drive digital and financial innovations to greater heights, and this is extremely positive for our nation’s development,” said Chua, who is also the investment director of Fortress Capital Asset Management.Vision Group is a Sarawakian-owned company with a niche in banking and finance, technology and digital transformation.“We see great potential in Sarawak’s push towards a digital economy and are constantly finding opportunities to work with the state government and local businesses to accelerate the development of a highly agile and innovative digital economy in Sarawak,” he says.An investment banker says it is rather obvious who the five recipients would be, at least for the first round.“Naturally, it will be for those with deeper pockets first, those who can afford to fail in this pilot phase as the financial sector moves into digital banking.“After everything stabilises and when all kinks are ironed out, then probably Bank Negara will open up more licences and allow the smaller players to come in,” he says.Expect more names to be bandied about in this crowded space as the closing date draws nearer.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd (CGC) has committed to guarantee up to RM10bil for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) from April 2020 to December 2021.The group reaffirmed its commitment to support MSMEs in their journey to recovery, rested on courage, strength and capacity to bounce back.Its chairman Datuk Mohammed Hussein said the next few months will continue to be challenging for the broad SME sector.“At times like this, CGC will continue to play our counter-cyclical roles to support MSMEs sustainability and recovery.“CGC is optimistic that the various assistance packages including Pemerkasa and Pemerkasa Plus will help to absorb the impact and provide a breather, especially to our MSMEs.“Coupled with the ongoing National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, it will further facilitate Malaysia’s economic recovery, ” Mohammed said in his address to shareholders at CGC’s 48th annual general meeting (AGM), held virtually on Thursday.CGC posted a net profit of RM108.5mil for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2020.This was a reduction of RM106.8mil or 49.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) from RM215.3mil in 2019.Group president and chief executive officer Datuk Mohd Zamree Mohd Ishak said CGC registered a healthy performance despite the challenging economic environment last year.He added that they have also successfully completed their five-year strategic plan (5SP) 2016-2020 and is currently into the first year of its 5SP 2021-2025.“The Corporation aims to intensify its transformational initiatives aspiring to be the ‘Partner for MSME Growth Across Life Stages’.“CGC remains committed to its mandate and is confident that with all of us playing our part, an accelerated wave of economic recovery is in sight, ” he said.With regards to CGC’s Beyond Guarantee initiatives, CGC continued to leverage on digitalisation via imSME, its online financial referral platform that helps MSMEs to source for financing products faster and easier.As at end-April, the imSME portal received more than 2.08 million visits with more than 39, 000 registered MSMEs.Another initiative is the Khidmat Nasihat Pembiayaan (MyKNP@CGC) that targets MSMEs who were unsuccessful in obtaining business financing from banks and would assist them by providing financial advisory and recommendations.\n",

      "Tenaga Nasional Bhd received it, so did Magnum Bhd and AEON Credit Service (M) Bhd. UEM Sunrise Bhd too was given one, while its sister company, UEM Edgenta Bhd, could not escape either.Maxis Bhd, S P Setia Bhd, MK Land Holdings Bhd and Ecofirst Consolidated Bhd were also not spared as they too were in the news for the same matter.Of course, in all these listed companies, they were at one time or another, audited by the taxman. As a result, disputes had arisen on the quantum of taxes due and the treatment of certain types of income and/or gains. Penalties were then imposed by the tax authorities.With the government trying hard to generate as much tax revenue as possible, especially during these trying times, corporations need to ensure that they do have a clean bill of health when it comes to tax liabilities and application of the relevant laws.As we know, tax avoidance is perfectly acceptable, driven by cleverly structured tax policies, which are all within the ambit of the law. However, tax evasion is an entirely different thing and companies can run into trouble with the Inland Revenue Board for it.When listed companies are faced with high tax demand notices and this becomes public knowledge via announcements to Bursa Malaysia, stakeholders must have comfort that the tax function in the companies is managed well and professionally.Tax governance is now an area of greater importance. In fact, Dr. Veerinderjeet Singh, the president of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants and the Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is a strong proponent of this matter with the regulatory authorities and has spoken extensively at various public forums on issues related to tax governance.15% global tax rate is a game changerOne of the ways for a corporation to improve its tax governance is for all board of directors and/or audit committees to have an oversight over tax policies that are being adopted by entities. This is also in line with the various tax developments that are taking place internationally where there is demand for greater tax governance.As it is, two weeks ago, the G7 finance ministers adopted a uniform taxation system globally with at least a 15% tax rate. With this, although in Malaysia’s case the corporate tax rate is well above the rate, there could be cases whereby some of the Malaysian companies may have subsidiary companies that are domiciled in countries with a lower statutory rate or tax havens, and hence the demand for greater transparency among corporations is timely when it comes to tax matters.Since 2015, even the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has initiated a project called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), which is meant to address issues related to tax evasion and tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules in different countries to avoid paying tax.This is particularly so among multinational corporations where they are located in multiple jurisdictions where tax laws applied in one country would be different than another.According to the OECD, BEPS practices cost countries US$100bil-US$240bil (RM414.45bil-RM994.68bil) in lost tax revenue annually, which is equivalent to 4%-10% of the global corporate income tax revenue.The level of awareness among countries on this issue is rising and so far, over 139 countries and jurisdictions are implementing 15 actions to tackle tax avoidance, improve the coherence of international tax rules and ensure a more transparent tax environment.Taxes are also part of governanceFor Malaysia, the regulators have recently updated the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG) 2021, and one of the newly introduced practice is on sustainability and, of course, this is also in line with the environment, social and governance (ESG) framework that both the Securities Commission and Bursa Malaysia are increasingly focusing on for corporations to adopt.In fact, this is also in line with Bursa Malaysia’s own incentive of encouraging more companies to meet its strict criteria for inclusion into the FTSE4Good Index, which is now widely recognised as a benchmark index for ESG practices.However, one of the aspects of governance in ESG is related to tax transparency. Hence, the boards or audit committees too need to adopt an oversight when it comes to tax matters and to ensure that corporations are well within the ambit of the law when it comes to tax policies.In addition, Malaysia is a signatory to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which has 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and among others includes the capacity for tax and other revenue collection. What better way to show that Malaysia means business when it comes to SDG issues by having our corporations take tax matters more seriously and hence greater scrutiny of it.While board and audit committees can play an effective oversight role when it comes to tax matters and policies, it is also perhaps time to take tax governance more seriously by not only adopting them into a separate practice in future MCCG updates but also by introducing legislative measures that could make tax matters related to aggressive tax policies, which are not tied to commerciality, being treated as criminal offences.On disclosures, Bursa Malaysia could also introduce a tax compliance and risk statement under the integrated reporting framework to make boards and audit committees more aware of issues related to taxes and policies that are adopted.Hopefully, with the changing global environment when it comes to taxes, Malaysia too is ready to adopt these sweeping changes to ensure we remain in compliance with the relevant laws and practice of good governance.While the taxman may still call upon some companies, it is hoped such incidences are minimised so as to not create shocks to shareholders and other stakeholders. But that could only happen when companies have a robust tax risk policy and effective governance in place.Pankaj C. Kumar is a long-time investment analyst. The views expressed here are his own.\n",

      "Are robo advisers needed to achieve financial freedom?\n",
      "Business\n",
      "YAP MING HUI\n",
      "SINCE the introduction of robo advisers in Malaysia, it has been popular with the Millennials and Generation Z, who grew up in a tech-laden world.Nevertheless, the pandemic, during which large amounts of time is spent at home, is also beginning to stir interest amongst older investors who view robo advisers as an option for their investment portfolio. As such, this developing digital innovation warrants a pragmatic view of how it would fit in the ecosystem of one’s personal finance.A friend of mine recently asked for my views on robo advisers as an investment alternative. A businessman with three young kids, Mike was excited to jump in on the robo adviser bandwagon. He has already invested RM500,000 into a few robo advisers and is contemplating to pump in another RM2.5mil when we met up.What are robo advisers?In a nutshell, robo advisers are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven investment services with little to no human supervision.In Malaysia, the Securities Commission has classified robo advisers as a digital investment manager and issued licences to providers such as Stashaway, MyTheo, and Waheed.What proceeded was a long conversation between Mike and myself. We discussed the inner workings of robo advisers and whether it would be able to accommodate what he set out to achieve.According to Mike, robo advisers are cheaper alternatives to unit trust investments. By eliminating the presence of human advisers, robo advisers are able to offer the same services at a fraction of the cost.There are no sales charges compared to the 5% to 6% imposed by unit trust investment. He even countered that the annual management fee is only 0.5% compared to 1.5% for unit trust.Mike shared that he was taken in by the convenience of robo advisery platforms. It gave him access to diversify into global markets. Indeed, in the age of digitalisation, anyone with Internet access can perform transactions at the comfort of their own homes.The same cannot be said for traditional human advisers, who warrant a face-to-face meeting in order to transact.For example if a client wanted to execute a trade, he would have to call or physically meet with a financial adviser, explain his needs, fill out the required paperwork, and wait. Nevertheless, the increasing popularity of video-meeting facilities like Zoom changes things a little.Mike further shared that he does not require the services from a human financial planner anymore now that he has engaged a robo adviser.As a wealth management practitioner for the last two decades, I could certainly appreciate the benefits of using a robo adviser. From an affordability, accessibility, and convenience standpoint, it has merits. But, it should not be the only point of contention.Therefore, in the grand scheme of things, it is critical to be aware of the limitations of robo advisers.I in turn presented Mike with a few significant disadvantages of a robo adviser:>ETF has its performance limitationsMost robo advisers only invest in exchange traded funds (ETFs). From the best of breed fund manager selection perspective, ETFs have its own strengths and limitations.ETFs tend to perform better in certain developed markets like the US. In other developing markets such as China, Malaysia and other Asian countries, human investment managers generally perform better than robo advisers.Therefore investors who invest only in robo advisers will miss out on some of the best of breed funds available in certain markets.> Limitations as a fund managerRobo advisers are not ideal for investors who have a large sum to invest because they are not able to offer access to some of the major asset classes effectively. In Mike’ case, he has already invested RM500,000 in a robo adviser. To capture the opportunities of other asset classes, I suggested that he could, for example, diversify into real estate investment.We all know how popular physical property investment is with Malaysians. In fact, it is an important asset class that has the opportunity to provide investors with both capital gain and rental income. It is also possible to use mortgage loan as leverage as well.In addition, Mike may want to gain more exposure to an industry sector already accessed by his current robo adviser portfolio, for example, the technology sector.Therefore, Mike would need to find another investment alternative like unit trust or ETF, to get the extra exposure that he wants.In short, a robo adviser is just another fund manager playing the function similar to a unit trust fund manager.It has its strengths and limitations. As such I cautioned Mike that its performance should be evaluated regularly so that timely decisions whether to keep, sell or buy can be made.> No holistic and comprehensive financial planningDue to its rather confusing name, some people like Mike mistake robo advisers as digital financial advisers that are capable of replacing a human financial planner.The fact of the matter is, robo advisers are only but a subset of the entire financial planning ecosystem.Holistic financial planning is the comprehensive service which aims to manage and grow one’s wealth with high certainty by taking into consideration the following eight areas of wealth management – Investment Planning and Management, Risk Management and Insurance, Children’s Tertiary Education Planning, Retirement Planning, Asset Protection, Estate Planning, Debt and Loan Management and Tax Planning.If you were to compare the entire service offering of what financial planning entails, robo advisers at best only cater for the investment planning and management process.For matters pertaining to estate planning, risk management, insurance and debt management, Mike would still need to go to a traditional holistic financial planner as robo advisers cannot provide the convenience of a one-stop solution. Investors need to be fully aware of the implications of choosing one over another.> No customised adviceEarlier we have established that robo advisers are at best another investment or fund manager.Therefore, robo-advisers are incapable of providing customised advice, especially when there is a need to look at the client’s wealth in a holistic and unique manner.Its failure to capture the full picture of a client’s financial assets and liabilities, pales in comparison to a human financial planner, who strives to get to know their clients comprehensively to provide customised financial and investment advice.> No personal touchFinancial and investment decisions very often have emotional and psychological effects on an individual and a robot can never deliver the empathy and understanding of its human counterpart.Relationship building and connection are what we as humans generally desire. It is also one of the core essences for professionals who run a financial advisory business.Clients find assurance and value in having a professional sounding board to guide them through their money and investment matters. However, with robo advisers, you will find that the total hands-off approach (lack of human touch and empathy) can be somewhat cold and unsupportive psychologically.A robo adviser will not hold your hand and talk you off the ledge after a significant market drop. In comparison, a human financial adviser is there to assuage your fears, explain how the investment markets work and suggest the right actions to take.>Lack of coaching to take higher risk for higher returnIf you are a low-risk investor, you’d have parked all your earnings in a savings account and/or in fixed deposits. In order to increase the investment return of your money, you need to learn to take and live with higher risks.Robo advisers don’t normally provide one to one risk coaching services. A holistic financial planner who is competent, and experienced can effectively guide an investor to get out of their comfort zone to take higher risk and help manage the risk along the way.“A good decision is based on knowledge, not on numbers.” ~ PlatoAs you can see by now, robo advisers are at best another investment option in a sea of investment opportunities. It won’t replace a human financial planner, especially the competent and experienced ones.I hope my sharing of the conversation in this article can also help the readers have a better understanding of what a robo adviser can and cannot offer in your personal financial planning and management.Yap Ming Hui is a licensed financial planner.

There must be better coordination in future,\" he said in a statement today.Syed Hussain said the MEF had raised the issue with the authorities many times before, as uncoordinated checks by authorities were disrupting business and setting back the recovery process.\"Employers should not be subjected to such unnecessary stress and disruptions as there is enough personal and economic stress to manage.\"The MEF requests again that all enforcement activities be coordinated inter and intra-agencies so that stress will be reduced for all of us facing the pandemic, ” he added. - Bernamaa\n",

However, its descending trajectory could be an early indication of consolidation over the immediate term.On the 14-day relative strength index, momentum is also looking strong at 62 points and rising.Meanwhile, the daily moving average convergence/divergence line is outpacing the signal line as it ascends in positive territory.Should the stock fail to make headway, it could remain close to the 50-day SMA currently travelling horizontally near 39 sen.

For example, S P Setia Bhd reported that sales for the first quarter of 2021 were encouraging despite the weak market sentiment,” says PublicInvest Research.Acorus at Setia EcoHill 2 in Semenyih was launched via a special online preview, which saw its double-storey terrace units (20ftx65ft) being fully taken up before Chinese New Year.Following this success, Acorus 2 was launched in March and 70% of the units were taken up on the first day of its launch.The latest phase of Setia Alam‘s Bywater Homes collection in Shah Alam, Plenum, also received overwhelming response from its online launch in mid-March, as all its double-storey units (22ftx70 ft) were fully booked within an hour.More recently, Glades of Westlake (with a gross development value or GDV of RM156mil) – which is the second last island phase of Setia Eco Glades in Cyberjaya – was launched towards the end of March.The project saw almost 70% of its double-storey semi-detached homes (41ftx85ft) priced from RM1.8mil and bungalows (59ftx85ft) priced from RM3.1mil being booked within just three weeks of its launch.PublicInvest Research also points out that based on recent National Property Information Centre (Napic) data, the residential overhang situation has improved slightly with 29,565 overhang units worth RM18.9bil recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 (with a further decrease of 0.3% quarter-on-quarter or q-o-q in the first quarter of 2021), a drop of 3.6% in volume.Meanwhile the “unsold-under construction” and “unsold-not constructed” numbers also improved, dropping to 71,735 units (2019: 72,692 units) and 12,975 units (2019: 16,774 units), down by 1.3% and 22.6% respectively primarily due to the cautious stance of most developers in launching projects, as most were focused on clearing inventories.Separately, in the fourth quarter of 2020, planned supply increased by 0.8% q-o-q but was 2.6% lower year-on-year (y-o-y).Johor still has the highest number and value of overhang in the country with 7,030 units worth RM5.48bil, accounting for 23.8% and 29% respectively of the national total.Meanwhile, Selangor (4,889 units), Perak (3,637 units) and Kuala Lumpur (3,023 units) are among those states with the highest overhang.In terms of value, the second highest was Selangor (RM4.29bil), followed by Kuala Lumpur (RM2.92bil) and Perak (RM1.16bil).By type, condominium/apartment formed 51.9% (15,354 units) of the national total overhang, followed by terraced houses (28.1% or 8,306 units).The research unit notes that in the first quarter of 2021, residential sales improved by 26% y-o-y but eased 6% q-o-q.Despite loan approvals dropping by 17% y-o-y, loan applications were steady with a 2% y-o-y increase, suggesting property demand is still healthy though financing is still difficult given the economic stress.The ratio of loan approvals against loan applications for the purchase of residential property stood at 35% in 2020 versus 43.2% in 2019. Interestingly, residential loan applications for January and February 2021 started with an increase of 62% and 2% while residential loans approved moved up 26% and 15% respectively, indicating positive buying momentum.PublicInvest Research also points out that riding on recovery hopes, the property sector has outperformed the benchmark FBM KLCI by more than 5% year-to-date, primarily on positive tailwinds on low mortgage rates, impending economic recovery, Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) initiatives and various stimulus measures by the government.The property sector is currently trading at an undemanding 71% discount to the book value.The research unit also notes that the property sector is now increasingly being consolidated, dominated by a few large property players with land banks that have a GDV potential of almost RM100bil.“We estimate that the top-seven developers alone have more than 70% of the market share in Malaysia out of more than 1,000 property developers.“The big developers could benefit the most if the sector rebounds going into next year with their scale advantage and well-located land banks with low holding costs.”PublicInvest Research has upgraded its stock call to an “outperform” on S P Setia (target price RM1.25), Eco World Development Group Bhd (target price 98 sen) and Sime Darby Property Bhd (target price 79 sen).It also has “outperform” calls on IGB Bhd (target price RM2.70) and LBS Bina Group Bhd (target price 69 sen).\n",

      "FOR all the talk of a commodities boom, some markets have now wiped out gains for the year and several more are close to doing so.Soybean futures have erased their 2021 advance, sliding more than 20% from an eight-year high reached in May. Corn and wheat have also tumbled from multi-year highs.The Bloomberg Grains Spot Subindex slid the most since 2009 on Thursday. Other commodities that saw big rallies evaporate include platinum, while once-surging nickel, sugar and even lumber have faltered.The fact that some commodities markets are falling while others – including crude oil and tin – are holding gains underscores how unevenly the complex is responding to economies reopening and expanding once again.While those materials have climbed on strong demand fundamentals, others face their own unique headwinds, such as an easing supply worries in soybeans and monetary policy uncertainty in the case of gold and silver.Some materials also took a hit this week on China’s efforts to slow inflation and Federal Reserve signals for interest-rate increases, with the US dollar rising and the Bloomberg Commodity Index set for its worst week since the start of the pandemic.“Risk-off is front and centre thanks to the hawkish words from the Fed, which came on the back of the Chinese government-led directives over prior weeks, ” said Michael Cuoco, head of hedge-fund sales for metals and bulk materials at StoneX Group. “Central-bank stimulus helped the markets gather steam in the spring of 2020, and now there is a bit of a macro reset.”PullbackEven some of the markets that are clearly benefiting from the reopening are seeing a pullback, with copper heading for its worst week in more than a year. The cool-down in many raw materials comes after the Bloomberg commodity gauge reached multi-year highs. Analysts including those at Trafigura Group have said tight supplies and rampant demand point to the possibility of another supercycle – an extended period during which prices are well above their long-term trend.A gauge of the US dollar extended gains on Thursday after climbing the most in a year on Wednesday, making commodities less appealing to investors holding other currencies. A big backwardation in many commodities and seasonality accounts for some of the recent slump as futures contracts roll over.China has stepped up its campaign to rein in prices and reduce speculation in a bid to ease the threat to its economy from soaring raw-materials costs. The country’s top economic planner on Thursday reaffirmed its intention to cool commodities, and said it will release metals from state reserves in a timely manner to push prices back to a normal range.Also hurting prices of many agricultural products has been improving weather in growing regions. Recent beneficial rains have corn futures on track for the steepest monthly decline since 2011 and for soybeans since 2016.Getting whiplash“The volatility we are seeing now is all about weather, ” Stephen Nicholson, a senior analyst for grains and oilseeds at Rabobank, said in a phone interview on Thursday. “Over the last few weeks you just get whiplash from day to day.”The slump in many resource prices deepened this week after Fed officials sped up their expected pace of policy tightening, fuelling worries that the US central bank would soon pare stimulus that’s helped spur stellar gains in metals, agriculture and energy.Still, energy and industrial metals, which have gained from bets that reopening economies will stoke demand, are still well above where they started the year, and some analysts say the rally is unlikely to fade significantly.“We believe we are in the early innings of a decade long strong cycle in commodities, similar to the cycle that took place from the late 90’s through 2008, ” said Jason Bloom, global market strategist for Invesco, which oversees US$1.4 trillion (RM5.8 trillion) assets for clients.“The supply constraints are relatively insulated from the language of the Fed in a given meeting. China can push around prices in the short-term by releasing reserves, but they don’t control markets.” — Bloomberg\n",

      "REVIEW: The FBM KLC remains in a sideways trading channel, capped by uncertain market sentiment, despite a strong rebound yesterday. However, the positive performance helped to dispel fears of further declines as the index had exited below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) just a day earlier.During the first half of the week, the FBM KLCI stayed afloat of the 200-day SMA, which investors had clung to following a correction in the first week of May.At market open on Monday after three consecutive sessions of losses, the moving average served as a platform for bargain-hunting activity, alleviating some of the selling pressure on the local market.It was only a brief reprieve, however, as the consolidation phase remained firmly in place with subsequent profit-taking taking the index lower over subsequent days.There was some anticipation over the government’s late-Tuesday announcement as the National Recovery Plan offered more clarity on the lockdown plans. However, it failed to generate excitement among investors, given that its rollout was, rightly, dependent on the decrease in the number of daily coronavirus infections.The start of Phase 2 of the plan requires the number of daily Covid cases falling below 4, 000. Yesterday, the number of daily coronavirus infections remained elevated in the mid-6, 000s.Compounding the selling pressure in equities, the US Federal Reserve signalled at the end of its monetary policy meeting that it might be raising interest rates sooner than many had anticipated.Given the rapid pace of recovery in the US economy and rising inflation, the central bank hinted that it could make a return to higher lending rates as soon as 2023.The news came as unexpected as observers believed the current spike in inflation was temporary, coinciding with the sudden reopening of the economy.Reacting to the possible end of easy money, foreign funds retreated from riskier assets while the ringgit fell against the US dollar. Over two days, the ringgit shaved half a percent against the greenback to 4.14.The downside to sentiment was clearly reflected on Thursday’s price chart as the FBM KLCI shed 7.46 points to 1, 570.86, its lowest close in nearly a month.Yesterday, there was some bargain-hunting as investors struggled to return the index above the 200-day SMA. A surge in buying in late-afternoon trading saw the FBM KLCI ending the day with a firm performance, 18.19 points higher at 1, 589.05.Statistics: The major index ended the week 13.89 points or 0.8% higher over the previous Friday at 1, 589.05. Total turnover for the trading week stood at 28.12 billion shares amounting to RM18.25bil compared with 22.95 billion shares worth RM13.07bil in the previous four-day trading week.Outlook: The FBM KLCI managed to return above the 200-day SMA in a convincing fashion in late trading yesterday. However, the index remains caught within a narrow trading channel below the 1, 600 psychological resistance.In the coming week, investors could be looking to cash in on profits from the sharp surge in the recent session.The advance, however, helped to dispel notions that the FBM KLCI was due to resume its correction. Should the buying interest resume after a brief period of profit-taking, there could be an attempt to cross over the 50 and 100-day SMAs overhead, in an attempt to reach 1, 600.The slow-stochastic is looking healthy, having inched over the 50% mark while the 14-day relative strength index is looking more bullish at 57 points.The daily moving average convergence/divergence line, meanwhile, is inching higher past the signal line although a more convincing crossing would be needed to confirm a “buy” signal.The 200-day SMA continues to offer support while more significant support can be found at 1, 560.\n",

      "THE return of international football tournaments in front of a live crowd is worth cheering, with the star power of Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe bringing fans out in droves to bars and pubs eager to make up for a lost pandemic year.Less cheerful is the fact many fans remain glued to their screens wherever they are judging by the boom in online gambling fueled by the easy smartphone betting and seductive advertising that captivated many during lockdown.With awareness of mental health, stress and the public-health costs of gambling addiction on the rise amid Covid-19, it’s a cue to consider whether current rules are tough enough.Having a captive audience with cash to spare has been good for business: France, whose national team is the bookmakers’ favourite to win the UEFA EURO2020, posted a record €2.2bil (US$2.6bil or RM10.66bil) in online sporting bets in the first three months of the year.The UK, Europe’s top online gambling market, is also breaking records with events like the Grand National horserace. Shares of Ladbrokes owner Entain Plc and lottery operator La Francaise des Jeux have soared on rising profits.Yet if the camaraderie of a tentpole sports event is increasingly linked to quick-fire bets everywhere, it’s also thanks to a flood of breezy promotions, ads, time-limited bets and celebrity sponsorships that incite people to bet with few reminders of the risks.Persistent warningsWhile a mix of rules and voluntary restraint from the operators themselves are supposed to keep things in check, it’s time to heed persistent warnings from public-health experts that children and problem gamblers aren’t being protected enough.The content of these ads can cross the line: One recently-scrapped betting campaign in France depicted a young winner carried aloft through his neighborhood as his elders respectfully kneeled before him. But even less egregious ads give off unrealistic vibes of skills-based windfalls that hardly reflect reality. Industry heavyweights’ gross margins of more than 40% show the house has a tendency to win. “If you’re playing more, you’re losing more,” Ladbrokes’s former boss said last year, adding that 99% of his customers lost.Branding and advertising that aim to normalize gambling and sports betting have succeeded through ubiquitous logos and tweets. Measures like a voluntary “whistle-to-whistle” ban on in-match television advertising in the UK, where the industry spends £1.5bil (RM8.2bil) a year, mean little next to social media and team sponsorships. Top psychiatrists have warned it’s a public-health risk reminiscent of tobacco ads.Operators are keen to promote what their business gives back to the economy: The European Gaming and Betting Association says its members in 2019 held 145 licenses across the continent and invested €107.1mil (RM543mil) in sport sponsorships.That won’t go unnoticed post Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo sees sports betting as a way to boost tax, while huge losses racked up by the likes of the UK’s Premier League will need filling.But at a time when athletes are becoming more outspoken over the products they sponsor, and as social attitudes even in bet-friendly Britain are hardening against glitzy gambling promotions, momentum is likely to build behind tougher rules.Focusing solely on education and research to preserve individual responsibility isn’t going to cut it when data suggests the problem gambling could affect almost 1.4 million Brits.Outright banAn outright ban on gambling advertising, as seen in Italy, isn’t likely to see wide take-up and might work better as a threat than reality.But a ban on gambling sponsorships of sports teams, approved in Spain and under review in the UK, could gain traction. Right now, too much responsibility lies in the hands of individual clubs that can’t easily afford to turn down £5mil to £10mil (RM29mil to RM59mil). Norwich City recently ended its deal with online casino BK8 after fan uproar over the company’s sexualised marketing materials.Gambling companies might protest, but they may also appreciate a releveling of the marketing playing field against rivals.But the real pressure, as sports-marketing expert Richard Denton of the Johan Cruyff Institute points out, will be on the soccer teams whose attempts at pulling other revenue levers (such as the Super League) haven’t always worked.When the Formula 1’s tobacco sponsorship ended in 2005, it sparked a business-model revamp to make up for the shortfall. Other sports will need time and support to make similar changes.Any new rules should be imposed carefully, and fairly, but given the social harms at stake, they’re worth a punt. — BloombergLionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

      "THE Covid-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way a lot of industries have had to conduct their business, with the retail sector being no exception.Deloitte, in its paper “The future of the mall: Building a new kind of destination for the post-pandemic world, ” notes that the pandemic has shocked the retail industry.“Shopping malls, once popular meeting hubs that were already feeling the pressure from e-commerce and decreased foot traffic, were suddenly devoid of customers as the world locked itself down in an effort to contain the virus’s spread.“One thing is certain, our retail experience is about to be revolutionised, ” it says.One industry observer concurs that retail operators will certainly have to “start thinking outside the box” to pull in the crowds.“While the pandemic is still far from over, mall operators will need to come up with innovative and unique ways to increase the footfall at their premises.“There is a need to build confidence in the shopper that malls are still a safe and convenient place to convene.”No doubt, this will be a tall order, considering that social distancing has become the new normal.Deloitte says retailers and mall owners have been investing in their digital and e-commerce capabilities to elevate their brand and customer experience even before Covid-19 is clearly poised to come out ahead.With the pandemic, Deloitte notes that today’s shoppers are demanding a safe, frictionless environment.“The consumer’s needs and shopping habits after Covid-19 will be in constant flux as their emotions battle opposing forces, namely the desire to get in and out quickly; and the need to be social and interact with one another.”Deloitte says the key to getting shoppers back into malls will be for owners and retailers to work together to invest in customer safety and to provide tools and applications that make for a smoother, more convenient shopping experience.“There has been a rapid rise in the popularity of convenience services such as self check-out, click-and-collect, curbside/store-door pickup, buy-online-pickup-in-store and free or hassle-free returns through services like a centralised returns area in the mall.“Curbside delivery emerged during the Covid-19 crisis as a way for shops and major chains alike to continue to provide products to customers while making safety a priority.”Deloitte emphasises that malls can no longer be purely about shopping.“For daily essentials such as grocery, bakery and pharmacy, consumers increasingly prefer one-stop shop destinations.“As the restrictions imposed to protect public health during the pandemic are eased, people will likely be craving more social interaction.“If their functional needs are being met close to home, malls themselves will need to build broader, more dynamic experiences that people can’t find elsewhere.”Deloitte says landlords and retailers will need to collaborate creatively to drive foot traffic and boost dwell times to increase their revenue productivity.“Retailers need to take a page from digital-first companies. It’s never been more important to build a seamless omnichannel brand presence.“Customers are increasingly looking for a digitised experience both online and off, enabled by technological innovation at every turn.“Malls and retailers need to use digital tools to maximise productivity and efficiency and create a dynamic, engaging experience.”But most of all, Deloitte says malls must become the new meeting place for the community, namely a multi-purpose destination that offers extensive leisure activities as well as other functions, like office, residential, and cultural amenities.“Shops should be mixed in with other complementary uses, giving visitors an interactive experience in which the entire environment comes into play.“Owners may need to rethink their rental models to allow for different types of retail experiences, such as short-term pop-ups or exhibitions.“There is a great opportunity here to be innovative, ” it says.Meanwhile, Retail Group Malaysia (RGM) has revised downwards marginally its 2021 growth forecast for the industry to 4% from 4.1% previously.The revision is in light of the re-introduction of the movement control order (or MCO 3.0) on May 3, as well as the national lockdown on June 1.The first phase of the lockdown, which was supposed to last for two weeks until June 14, has been extended for another two weeks until June 28.RGM managing director Tan Hai Hsin warned that any extension would have an adverse impact on the local retail industry.“Any extension of the two-week lockdown will damage the retail industry further. Any delay on the re-opening of non-essential retailers after two weeks will lead to more closures, ” he says in RGM’s latest Malaysia retail industry report.Tan also says the second-quarter (Q2) growth estimate of 18.4% given by members of the Malaysia Retailers Association and Malaysia Retail Chain Association is no longer attainable.A large majority of retailers gave their estimates before the announcements of the MCO 3.0 and lockdown. In addition, Tan says RGM is revising the growth rate for Q2 of 2021 from 7% to 5.6%.“The Malaysian government will continue the lockdown beyond the two-week period with revised movement restrictions and ban on the opening of certain retail trades. Retail sales during Q3 of 2021 will be affected as well. RGM revises the growth rate from 4.1% to 3.5% for Q3, ” says Tan.Additionally, he notes that the interstate travel ban is expected to be enforced for a longer period of time and will severely affect domestic tourism spending.“Travel bubbles with selected countries will likely begin towards the end of this year. Malaysia will witness rising foreign tourist arrivals only from the first half of next year.”Tan adds that vaccinations on the majority of the population will take a while.“Thus, movement restrictions and social distancing measures will remain until the end of this year.“RGM expects the retail industry to begin its gradual recovery by the end of this year.“For Q4 of 2021, the retail industry is expected to grow by 12.7%, ” he says.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia and Singapore have intensified their longer-term positioning as regional hubs for green and sustainable finance, making the issuing of sustainability bonds in Asean more vibrant.The Climate Bonds Initiative, supported by HSBC, has launched the Asean Sustainable Finance State of the Market 2020, which revealed that the region's sustainable finance market has maintained rapid growth despite the negative impact of COVID-19, drawing attention to the need for a sustainable economic recovery.The report noted that the Malaysian sustainability bond and sukuk market currently stood at US$2.6 billion.A total of 15 green bond, sukuk and loan deals have been issued by Malaysian entities, with six occurring in 2019 and three in 2020.One of the green deals, which came into the market in 2020 was the first ASEAN Green Sustainable and Responsible Investment Sukuk, worth RM260 million (US$61m) and issued by Leader Energy, with HSBC Amanah Malaysia as the lead arranger.\"The proceeds are to finance two solar photovoltaic power projects in Kedah, which also marks Leader Energy’s debut project financing issuance in the ringgit denominated bond market,” the report revealed.The report also highlighted key policy developments that are anticipated to drive Asean’s sustainable finance market, such as Malaysia’s Joint Committee on Climate Change, led by Bank Negara Malaysia and Securities Commission Malaysia.It will identify the development of guidance documents on climate risk management and scenario analysis as one of its priorities in 2021, according to the report.Meanwhile, the Asean Green, Social, and Sustainability (GSS) issuance reached a record high of US$12.1 billion in 2020, from US$11.5 billion issued in 2019.Cumulative GSS issuance in Aseansince 2016 now stood at US$29.1 billion.\"Singapore remained the leader of GSS issuance in 2020, representing 53 per cent of the region’s issuance,” the report said.On the sector’s outlook, the report suggested that sustainable finance is set to further underpin national recovery and stimulus plans to \"build back better.”\"Public sector issuance remains a driver to encourage private sector issuers to participate in the market, and ASEAN’s sovereign issuers’ club is set to expand with planned sovereign green bond issuance already announced by Singapore and Vietnam.\"Malaysia, on the other hand, sees a future role as an international centre for sustainable Islamic finance and green sukuk,” it added.In addition, Asean markets are collectively developing a system to bring greater clarity to market participants and deepening efforts to improve definitions for sustainable investments.The development of other instruments, such as three sustainability-linked bonds and loans or transition bonds, are also needed to meet the larger financing needs of Asean’s low carbon transition. - Bernama\n",

      "BEIJING: China is hoping for the U.S. to remove punitive tariffs on its goods, with a commerce ministry researcher arguing it’s in America’s best interest to do so as worries over inflation mount.The two countries should scrap or reduce the tariffs imposed on each other under the Trump administration to help push forward future trade talks, said Mei Xinyu, a researcher at China’s Ministry of Commerce. It’ll also curb U.S. inflation pressures at a time when prices are rising faster than expected.\"That’ll be a rational choice, ” Mei, who works at the ministry’s Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said in an interview in Beijing. \"By cutting tariffs, it can not only help the U.S. ease their inflation pressure, but can also benefit U.S. consumers.”With China the top exporter to the U.S., lower tariffs would mean reduced inflation imported from China, Mei said, allowing policy makers there to keep monetary policy loose to support that economy’s recovery.However, easier monetary and fiscal policies will inevitably result in faster growth in imports from China, Mei added, which could worsen the trade imbalance between the two countries. The widening U.S. trade deficit with China was one of former president Donald Trump’s main arguments for imposing tariffs at the time.\"A loose monetary policy and a more balanced trade with China can’t be achieved at the same time, ” Mei said in the interview Tuesday.Trade TalksThe two countries are slowly resuming official contact under the Biden administration, with China’s Vice Premier Liu He holding separate calls with U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in recent weeks.However, the signals from the two sides differ, with China saying the meetings showed normal communications have started and the two countries are pushing forward trade and investment ties, while Tai said recently there’s still \"significant imbalance” in the trade relationship.Mei pointed to the U.S. domestic political environment as another hindrance to future trade talks.For trading partners that are considering negotiating with America,\"U.S. society seems very divided, ” Mei said. \"If the deal proposed can’t be passed within the U.S., then is it still meaningful for America’s trading partners to talk to the U.S.?”The phase one trade deal signed between both countries in January 2020 left in place higher tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of U.S. imports from China, and also on some U.S. exports to China. So far, Beijing has made only incremental progress in meeting the targets under the agreement.Mei said China’s failure to keep up with the scheduled pace of its purchases is partly because the U.S. can’t produce and ship goods fast enough.\"We should respect objective economic laws when making any negotiations or deal, ” he said. - Bloomberg\n",

      "MUNICH, Germany (Reuters) - Germany's confident approach to their 4-2 win over Portugal on Saturday in their second Euro 2020 match was part of a plan to press from the opening whistle while taking every opportunity to attack, coach Joachim Loew said.Three-times European champions Germany shrugged off their opening-game loss to France and announced their arrival as serious contenders at Euro 2020 with the victory over highly-rated Portugal in their Group F match.\"We never had any doubts after losing to the world champions,\" Loew told reporters. \"We knew we could do better.\"The task was to present ourselves in a different way, especially in attack. From the beginning we wanted to show the Portuguese players we want to win and we do not want to lose.\"The victory moves Germany, who face Hungary in their final game, into second place in the group on three points, a point behind leaders France and level on points with the Portuguese. Hungary drew 1-1 with France earlier on Saturday.Loew also praised forward Thomas Mueller for making sacrifices for the team by defending all over the pitch and making runs that opened up space and chances for others.\"Thomas did a lot of runs and didn't create so many opportunities or the chance to be clinical but he opened up spaces and defended well,\" Loew said.\"He worked well for the team. His position was to start pressing situations and stop the attacks.\"Portugal grabbed an early lead against the run of play before Germany stormed back thanks to two own goals in the first half and second-half strikes from Kai Havertz and Robin Gosens.Loew expected a tough game against a Hungary side likely to sit back and defend but he looks to have all his players at his disposal after slight niggles he described as muscle problems forced three substitutions -- including Mats Hummels, Gosens and Ilkay Gundogan-- as a precaution.\"That is why we had to undertake those three substitutions,\" he said. \"But I don't think it is anything dramatic with Mats Hummels and I think we will make it happen to have him play next week.\"(Reporting by Michael Kahn in Prague, Editing by Ken Ferris)\n",

We just wanted to press the midfield players - Gundogan and Kroos -- and we wanted our full backs to drive forward,\" Santos told a news conference.\"But it was clear to see that we were always short of an extra man in the midfield and were pushed back. It was my strategy and I'm fully responsible for it.\"In the first half, they suffered just two fouls. If we can't stop them, if we have issues having possession, then we have problems.\"Germany's left wing-back Robin Gosens also tormented the Portugal defence with his speed and power and capped a memorable individual display with a goal and an assist.While Santos pointed at a number of individual defensive mistakes throughout the match, he refused to blame his players for the defeat.Portugal face group leaders France in a rematch of the 2016 Euro final, knowing their progress in the tournament remains uncertain.\"The players should have been able to cover the right hand side. But I don't want to blame them,\" Santos said.\"Whether we progress or not is still up to us. And we must respond against France.\"Germany's victory moved them level with Portugal on three points, one behind group leaders France, heading into a decisive final round of matches on Wednesday.(Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n",

(Reuters) - Rory McIlroy is finally back with a chance at the business end of a major championship, two strokes from the lead at the U.S. Open and in with a chance to end his long major drought.The Northern Irishman thinks a three under par final-round at Torrey Pines on Sunday will probably be enough to claim his fifth major trophy, and first since 2014.\"I thought 68s over the weekend from where I was after Friday was going to have a good chance,\" he said after a four-under-par 67 that matched the best third-round score.\"I've done the first part of that job.

He did well to salvage bogey after taking a penalty stroke.\"This is the only tournament in the world where you fist pump a bogey,\" said McIlroy.\"There was really one loose shot out there, the drive on 15, but apart from that, it's one of the best rounds of golf I've played in a while.\"I'm just excited for the opportunity to have a chance.\"(Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by William Mallard)\n",

The third game will be crucial, we need to win it if we want to get through to the next round.

There were moments where they held back, but they looked to press us whenever we had the ball.\"Of course it's something we struggle with.

Eei Hui has been selected instead of Paulus Firman as she is in charge of the independent pair Peng Soon-Liu Ying.The Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) coaching director Wong Choong Hann (pic) will lead the badminton group as the team manager.Choong Hann admitted that the coaches were also going the extra mile in training over the past four weeks to prepare for the team’s departure on July 17. The Olympics is from July 23-Aug 8.“The coaches now are equally busy as the players. They are in the gymnasium and doing all kinds of activities to keep fit. All of us are practically on the court, training together with the players,” said Choong Hann.“Due to the Covid-19 situation, the rules has been tightened. We are unable to bring sparring players. We have to make do with the team we have and work together. This applies to all the other countries too.“We will be in Tokyo five days before the official opening ceremony. We will head straight to the Games Village, we have been given the permission to train at the practice hall.”Choong Hann admitted that their last lap of training was crucial.“All the players are in the bubble system right now. They don’t get to see their family or friends, in fact, this has been the case for the last four weeks,” he said.“It’s not easy but the players are giving their best in training. Of course, some do have their down days, some miss their families, some go through emotional challenges...all these have to be managed. The priority now is the Olympics,” he added.\n",

      "SAN DIEGO, Calif. (Reuters) - Perennial major contender Louis Oosthuizen sank a monster eagle putt at the final hole to vault into a three-way tie for the lead after the third round at the U.S. Open on Saturday.South African Oosthuizen's downhill 50-footer slammed into the middle of the flag and toppled in to add another layer of fascination to what already was shaping up to be a compelling final round Sunday at Torrey Pines.With a one-under-par 70, Oosthuizen joined surprising Canadian Mackenzie Hughes (68) and steady American Russell Henley (71) at five-under 208.But the three frontrunners did not have to look far over their shoulders to see heavyweights Rory McIlroy (67) and Bryson DeChambeau (68) waiting to pounce just two strokes behind.Pre-championship Jon Rahm (72), despite a double-bogey, is among a trio three behind.Thirteen players in all are within four shots of the lead.Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open champion, has completed the career runner-up grand slam, and just last month was equal second behind Phil Mickelson at the PGA Championship.Now he has another chance but knows it will take something special.\"There's a lot of great players up there that have a chance of winning this, and I just need to go out and play as good as I can tomorrow,\" he said.Henley started the day tied for the lead with Richard Bland, and maintained at least a share of it the entire day.\"I'm 32, I don't know how many more good years I have of golf left,\" said the three-time PGA Tour winner. \"I'm excited, and you always wonder what it would feel like or be like to be in contention.\"He will find out soon enough.Hughes, meanwhile, vaulted into contention by holing a 60-foot eagle putt at the par-five 13th that prompted an enormous gallery roar that reverberated across the canyons to the rest of the course.In uncharted territory, he did not even attempt to downplay the situation.\"You get goosebumps thinking about it, so I know I'm going to be nervous tomorrow,\" he said.\"I essentially played today around the lead all day. I think I was only ever a few back the entire day. I think it'll feel different tomorrow being in that last group, but you do the same things.\"BLAND'S RUN HALTED, NO MICKELSON GRAND SLAMWhile Hughes surged, halfway co-leader Bland's fairytale run came to a screeching halt. The 48-year-old who recently became the oldest winner on the European Tour, battled to a 77 that left him six behind.McIlroy, seven years removed from the most recent of his four major titles, could hardly ask for a better chance to end his drought.\"I'm trying to think of the last time where I really felt like I had a chance,\" said McIlroy, who had to go back to the 2018 British Open where he tied for second.\"I'm just excited for the opportunity to have a chance.\"Defending champion DeChambeau, meanwhile, ignored a smattering of minor heckling to pound his way into contention with another bone-jarring performance of long driving.He compiled his first ever bogey-free round at an Open, picking up three birdies and coming ever so close to making a few more.\"You've got to be really patient out here at these majors,\" he said.\"It's something that is not easy to do. My first few goes at majors, I was not successful or anywhere near successful, and I feel like I'm starting to understand major championship golf and how to play it and how to go about managing my game, my attitude and just my patience level.\"If I can continue to do that tomorrow, I think I'll have a good chance.\"Mickelson, a record six-times U.S. Open runner-up, saw his bid to complete the career grand slam disappear for another year after a sloppy five-over 76 left him at seven-over.Playing a month after becoming golf's oldest major winner at 50 by claiming the PGA Championship, Mickelson could not produce the same magic in his home town.(This story corrects Hughes details at 13th hole, in paragraph 13)(Reporting by Andrew Both; Additional writing by Steve Keating in Toronto, reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Ken Ferris, Daniel Wallis and William Mallard)\n",

      "TOKYO (Reuters) -Organisers of the Tokyo Olympics opened the athletes' village to the media on Sunday, showing off apartments and a timber-laced shopping plaza where 11,000 athletes would stay and mingle during the sporting extravaganza.The once-delayed Games are due to start on July 23 amid concern that the influx of thousands of people from around the world would contribute to the spread of the novel coronavirus.Japan has avoided the kind of explosive outbreaks that crippled many other countries. But its vaccination programme has been slow and the medical system pushed to the brink in parts of the country. The government's drive to hold the Games has been criticised by hospitals and doctors' unions.Underscoring the concern, a Ugandan athlete arriving in Japan for a preparation camp ahead of the Olympics late on Saturday was found to be infected with the virus, public broadcaster NHK said.Athletes will be shuttled in and out of the village and be tested for the coronavirus every day. Olympic rules ban singing and chanting during events and require athletes to wear masks at all times except when outdoors, sleeping or eating.The shopping area of the village features an automatic teller machine, dry cleaner, post office, bank and courier counter.\"Where you can see bare light bulbs, we'll install lanterns to give the area a bit more of a traditional Japanese feel,\" Yoshie Ogawa, a director at the Tokyo 2020 marketing bureau, said at the start of the media tour.The wooden plaza, which draws on Japanese minimalist design aesthetics, follows the Tokyo 2020 theme of using timber in the construction of Olympics venues, including the National Stadium.The 2.4 billion yen ($21.8 million) shopping area was made from 40,000 pieces of timber donated by 63 Japanese municipal governments. Each donated piece is marked with the name of the area that provided the wood.After the Olympics, it will be dismantled and the timber returned to the donating cities for re-use in local facilities.The apartment complex abutting the shopping plaza was built on reclaimed land, and designed to house about 12,000 people in 23 buildings. It includes shops, a park and a school. The buildings will be converted into flats after the Olympics.The development of the housing project cost the Tokyo government 54 billion yen, including road work and infrastructure.Organisers were originally planning to feed residents of the village in vast dining halls – the largest with a capacity to seat 4,500 people.But now, organisers will ask athletes to dine alone, maintain social distancing with others, and wipe down surfaces after eating to curb the spread of the virus.($1 = 110.1900 yen)(Reporting by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n",

As I've said, I couldn't be more proud of that (squad of) 26 and I'll back them every day of the week.\"Italy are through to the last 16 after two wins from as many games, while Wales are also unbeaten in Group A with four points ahead of the final round of matches.\"It's going to be a big challenge. We have no doubt, even if that (unbeaten) record wasn't there, Italy are a big footballing nation and always make games difficult,\" Bale said.\"We're under no illusions, it's going to be a difficult game, but all we can do is plan, prepare and give it our all when we get on the pitch.\"... It's difficult to say where the game would rank if we won but it would for sure be a proud moment for all of us.

(Reuters) - Halfway U.S. Open co-leader Richard Bland received a sobering reality check when he plunged out of contention with a six-over-par 77 in the third round at Torrey Pines on Saturday.The 48-year-old English journeymen held it together with just one bogey on the front nine.But he struggled as the course firmed up in the afternoon sunshine, dropping five more shots and finishing ignominiously by hitting a ball into the pond known as Devlin's Billabong - named after Australian Bruce Devlin - in front of the 18th green.Bland said that conditions had been much tougher on Saturday afternoon than when he played on Friday morning, and that he had not been able to adapt.\"Yesterday morning, it was pretty soft, so you could be a little bit more aggressive,\" he said.\"Today, (the greens) were a lot firmer, and if you're going to give yourself decent chances, you have to be spot on with your distance control with your irons, and that's where I fell down today. I struggled with my irons all day.\"I drove the ball pretty good, which is what you need to do. I just couldn't take advantage from there, and I didn't really give myself any decent looks for birdies.\"Bland last month was rewarded for decades of perseverance when he became the oldest first-time winner on the European Tour.He has endured too many hard knocks during his long career to let Saturday's disappointment sting too much.\"That's the U.S. Open,\" he said.\"Some days it's just going to beat you up all day, and today was my day.\"Just put this one down to experience.\"(Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n",

      "(Reuters) - Seven-times Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton dispelled the \"myth\" surrounding a chassis swap with Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas after qualifying for Sunday's French Grand Prix.Hamilton and Bottas had swapped chassis for this weekend's race at the Paul Ricard circuit as part of a planned rotation, Mercedes said in the build-up.As a result, the Briton has been driving the chassis used by Bottas in the last four races, including a nightmare last round in Baku, while the Finn has the chassis that has carried Hamilton to three wins from six races.Mercedes said both chassis were identical, but the swap, coinciding with an upswing in form for Bottas and greater struggles for Hamilton, has led to speculation and conspiracy theories.\"I saw you coming up with some myth so I was happy to be able to prove you wrong,\" Hamilton told Sky Sports F1 commentator and former racer Paul di Resta in the post-qualifying interviews.\"The quality of our engineers' work, (our) cars are exactly the same.\"Hamilton qualified second on Saturday, behind Red Bull pole-sitter Max Verstappen but ahead of Bottas in third.The fired-up Finn, who headed into the weekend with speculation surrounding his Mercedes future, had led Hamilton through all three practice sessions.Hamilton admitted to struggling but said that had more to do with getting the car in the optimum operating window.\"As you can see today I managed to do a great job with the same car,\" he said after beating Bottas in qualifying. \"So it’s no different.\"We’re just in general struggling with getting everything from the tyres and getting the car in the right window.\"Bottas agreed, saying: \"I think it's more in the head.\"You think some chassis is better, some not, so I don’t think there’s much difference.\"(Reporting by Abhishek Takle; editing by Clare Fallon)\n",

      "LONDON (Reuters) - Former England manager Steve McClaren believes the fear factor that has hampered the \"Three Lions\" in previous tournaments has returned to Gareth Southgate's squad, who faced criticism for a flat performance in Friday night's goalless draw with Scotland.Southgate was hailed at the World Cup in Russia three years ago for removing the apprehension and pressure that has been blamed in the past for England not living up to expectations.But McClaren, who was sacked as England manager after failing to qualify for Euro 2008, believes that the old problem is back.\"England played with fear. They didn't want to make mistakes. They were playing safe, square, backwards. They weren't aggressive enough,\" he told Sky Sports.England were hailed by pundits after their 1-0 opening Group D win over Croatia while Scotland faced questions after a 2-0 loss to the Czech Republic in Glasgow, but the roles were reversed after an excellent display by Steve Clarke's team.\"I think Scotland played angry, hurt from the criticism of the first game. We were passive for the whole 95 minutes,\" said McClaren, currently technical director at Derby County.\"There is a team inside that squad that can win the Euros, without a shadow of a doubt. Gareth has to find that team. You get performances like that, I've seen it and been involved in it. Getting out of the groups is frustrating,\" he added.Former England defender Gary Neville suggested that the much hyped-up \"Battle of Britain\" may have negatiely impacted England.\"It was a really poor performance, a massive disappointment, underpinned by poor physical levels.\"Is it too big for them in terms of expectation? A few of those lads, it's probably the biggest game they've played in, all the media leading up to the game... Sometimes it can just mentally take it out of you. That was such a lacklustre display in such a big game,\" he said.Another ex-England player turned pundit, Rio Ferdinand, conceded that he may have over-reacted to the win over Croatia.\"I watched Croatia again yesterday. We beat an average, ageing Croatian team, let's be honest. They are not the team who got to the final of the World Cup.\"I hold my hand up, I got excited. We all get carried away. You have a right to get emotionally involved. But then realism kicks in,\" he said.The drab display from England's top goalscorer and captain Harry Kane, substituted in both games, has caused particular concern for England supporters and former Scotland manager Graeme Souness said unless he can refind his form.\"Harry is England's one player proven to get goals at this level on a regular basis. If that is not happening in this competition, you're not going very far,\" he told ITV.\"Go back to the World Cup in Russia: His goals got you where you got to, and Harry Kane not performing is a major problem for you. Football ain't coming home with that, not the way they are playing,\" he said.\"Harry doesn't look himself, he looks jaded, he looks tired and this is a guy looking to get a big move this summer. He needs to waken himself up. He came off in the first game, is he carrying something? He looks a shadow of himself.\"(Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Hugh Lawson)\n",

I'm taking it round by round, day by day,\" said Lyles, the world champion in that event. \"I'm not going to say 'survive and advance' because I just want to execute every race as best as I can.\"Five-time Olympic medallist Justin Gatlin, 39, got his bid for a fourth Games off to a roaring start, booking his spot in the semi-finals with a 9.93, tying with Fred Kerley for the third-best run of the night.\"For a lot of athletes I think it's going to take a lifetime best (to get to the finals),\" Gatlin told reporters. \"I think it's going to be a great finals, great semis too.\"Elsewhere in the day's action, 800m world champion Donavan Brazier advanced to the finals in the event.World record-holder Keni Harrison put up a leading time of 12.49 in the first round of the women's 100m hurdles, while Brianna McNeal, who has been suspended but received permission from the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS) to run, won her heat in 12.50.McNeal, who won the event in Rio five years ago, received a five-year ban, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) said earlier this month, for an anti-doping rule violation.In the discus, favourite Valarie Allman punched her ticket to Tokyo with a top performance of 69.92, followed by Micaela Hazlewood and Rachel Dincoff.(Reporting by Amy Tennery; Additional reporting by Gene Cherry; Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n",

It’s been a long journey,\" said Felix, who has stated this will be her last Olympic trials. \"I feel at peace with everything and I feel very prepared.\"Felix, who has picked up 13 world championship medals across her dazzling, nearly two-decade-long career, said she was savoring the time she gets to compete in front of Camryn, before she retires.\"Initially I was so disappointed with everything getting postponed, and then I began seeing all of the silver linings,\" said Felix. \"She's just so aware.\"Already a star at age 21, Sha'Carri Richardson proved she was worth the hype as she recorded a blistering 10.84 in the 100m, the top time in the event, despite her shoe coming untied during the race.\"I’ll be sure to lace them and tuck them for the next rounds to come,\" said Richardson, who achieved a 24.1 mph (38.8 km/h) top speed during the sprint.\"To win the Olympics, I’m gonna say it could take a world record,\" she added. \"There are so many phenomenal names that are predicted to be at the Olympic Games.\"Elsewhere in the day's action, reigning world champion Donavan Brazier clinched his 800m heat in 1:45, as expected, and 2016 bronze medalist Jenny Simpson, 34, won her first-round heat in the 1,500m in 4:11.34, as she bids for a spot in her fourth Games.(Reporting by Amy Tennery, additional reporting by Gene Cherry; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)\n",

      "MUNICH (Reuters) -Three-times European champions Germany shrugged off their opening game loss and announced their arrival as serious contenders at Euro 2020 with an emphatic 4-2 win over highly-rated Portugal in their Group F match on Saturday.The Germans had been beaten by world champions France in their opener prompting serious questions over their ability to make a challenge in this tournament but Joachim Loew's side responded to the pressure with an outstanding performance.Cristiano Ronaldo had given the defending champions a 15th minute lead with his 107th international strike but Germany went in at the break 2-1 up thanks to own goals from Ruben Dias and Raphael Guerreiro.The Germans turned on the style in the second half with efforts from Kai Havertz and the impressive Robin Gosens making it 4-1 before Diogo Jota pulled a goal back for Portugal.The result throws the 'Group of Death' wide-open and gives Germany a strong chance of progressing to the last 16.Germany, who face Hungary in their final game in Munich, move into second place in the group on three points, a point behind leaders France and level on points with the Portuguese. Hungary drew 1-1 with France earlier on Saturday.It was not merely the result that suggested some pundits were wrong to write off Germany - the fluency of their passing, the killer crosses and the intelligent running was a reminder of the enduring qualities of German football that has delivered so much success on the biggest stages.\"Overall it was an outstanding performance from the team, great attitude, great spirit, we had many chances, outstanding,\" said Loew.STRONG STARTGermany started with purpose and confidence and thought they had grabbed the lead in the fifth minute through Gosens but VAR ruled that Serge Gnabry had been in an offside position.Against the run of play, Portugal grabbed the early lead, hitting the Germans on the break with Bernardo Silva picking out Jota on the left of the box and his low cross was tapped in from close range by Ronaldo.It was the Portugal skipper's third goal in two games and his first ever against Germany but Joachim Loew's side kept their cool and continued to play positive football before eventually getting their reward.The Germans drew level in the 35th minute when Joshua Kimmich's cross from the right was volleyed at the back post by Gosens and flew into the net off the outstretched foot of Portugal defender Dias as he looked to stop Havertz converting.It was another own goal that gave Germany the lead -- Kimmich drove in a low ball from the right and Guerreiro's attempted clearance flew past his goalkeeper Rui Patricio.Portugal replaced Bernardo Silva with Renato Sanches at the break but Germany took a firm grip on the game with a third goal six minutes after the restart -- a well-worked passing move ending with Havertz turning in a low ball from the left delivered by the influential Gosens.GERMANY BUZZINGGermany were buzzing now and it was no surprise when they made it 4-1 on the hour with Gosens finishing off another well constructed attack, heading home a Kimmich cross at the far post.Portugal struck back quickly though when a deep free-kick from Guerreiro looked to be heading out but Ronaldo acrobatically hooked the ball inside to Jota who slotted home.Sanches fired a warning of a potential comeback when he thundered a long distance drive against the woodwork but Germany's victory was never really in doubt.The threat from the wide areas was particularly impressive with Gosens dynamic on the left and Kimmich impressive on the right while Havertz's ability to ghost into space was never neutralised by the Portugal defence.\"We wanted better movement up front. From the start there was tempo, good combinations, from the wings with Kimmich and Gosens... that was our plan and it worked,\" said Loew.Despite a 3-0 win over Hungary in their opening game, Portugal's progress to the last 16 is not secure and they need to take something from their final game against France in Budapest.\"Anyone can progress. This group was always very strong,\" said Portugal coach Fernando Santos. \"Whether we progress or not is still up to us. And we must respond to this.\"(Reporting by Simon Evans; additional reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n",

      "(Reuters) - It was \"goosebumps\" for 30-year-old Canadian Mackenzie Hughes, who rocketed up the leaderboard at the U.S. Open on Saturday and will play in the final group of a major for the first time in his career.Hughes, whose best finish in a major was 40th at the Masters this year, overcame a pair of bogeys on the front nine to card a three-under par 68, draining a long eagle putt on the par-5 13 and finishing the day with a birdie on the par-5 18 at San Diego's Torrey Pines.He rolls into the final round in a three-way tie for first place with South African Louis Oosthuizen (70) and American Russell Henley (71), a shot at his maiden major title on the horizon, despite missing the cut at the last five tournaments he entered.\"It really just comes down to mental toughness. I really think that the hard thing to do when you're in the midst of struggling like five cuts in a row that I had missed is to stay positive in light of that,\" said Hughes, whose sole win on the PGA Tour was the RSM Classic in 2016.\"I've been trying to do the hard thing, which is to be positive.\"He would be only the second Canadian to win a major, after Mike Weir in 2003, if he can fend off a stacked field including Rory McIlroy (67) and Bryson DeChambeau (68), who each trailed the lead by just two strokes through 54 holes.While the pressure of the moment would be enough to weigh on any competitor, Hughes told reporters his evening plans consisted of playing with his kids and eating pizza - and reliving his stellar play.\"I'll probably watch a couple of shots I hit today and kind of relish those and enjoy those and remember those for tomorrow,\" he said.(Reporting by Andrew Both; Writing by Amy Tennery; Editing by William Mallard)\n",

The best time to be peaking is in the knockout stages and hopefully kick on from there.\"England have had a muted start to the Euros after scraping a 1-0 win in their opener over Croatia, who beat England in the 2018 World Cup semi-finals in Russia, and failing to break down a dogged Scotland side in front of the home fans at Wembley.\"Maybe in Russia there were times, towards the quarter- and semi-final, when I wasn’t as sharp as I wanted to be,\" the 27-year-old Kane added. \"In the end we didn’t get to where we wanted to go, maybe partly for that reason.\"\"It’s about managing the squad, making sure everyone is feeling as fit and sharp as possible. In my case, it was a tough couple of games (Croatia and Scotland) and it’s about making sure I’m right for the rest of them.\"I didn’t have any issues. I didn’t feel physically I wasn’t up to it. I felt going into those games as good as I’ve felt all season, if I’m honest.\"Asked if a desire to leave his club Tottenham Hotspur had affected his performances for the national team, he replied: \"Absolutely not. All my focus is on how I can help this team and how we can be successful in this tournament.\"I understand from a media point of view there is speculation but I am fully focused on the job here.\"England, who have four points from two games, must beat group leaders the Czech Republic at Wembley on Tuesday to qualify for the last 16 in top spot. Kane believes that while they have been solid at the back they can improve up front.\"We all pride ourselves on not conceding, from front to back, and now I feel we can get better in the attacking third and be a bit more fluid and a bit more free and create a few more chances.

      "(Reuters) - Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen pulled off the unexpected on Saturday when he snatched a comfortable French Grand Prix pole for Red Bull at a track that had until now been a happy hunting ground for rivals Mercedes.The Dutchman, who leads Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton by four points in the overall standings, was in a league of his own around the 5.8-kilometre Paul Ricard circuit.His lap of one minute 29.990 seconds made him the only driver to breach the 1:30 barrier and was good enough to beat seven-times world champion Hamilton by 0.258 seconds.Verstappen's qualifying display followed an even more dominant showing in final practice earlier on Saturday when he lapped 0.747 seconds quicker than Hamilton’s team mate Valtteri Bottas, who qualified third for Sunday's race.“I knew it was going to be better than the last time we were here but this good I didn't expect,” said Verstappen after taking his second pole position of the season and the fifth of his career.“This has traditionally not been an amazing track for us but to be able to put it on pole here, of course we're super happy about that.”Mercedes have been dominant at the track at Le Castellet in southern France since it joined the calendar as host of the returning French Grand Prix in 2018.The team topped every practice and qualifying session for the 2018 and 2019 races, with Hamilton going on to win both from pole. The race did not take place last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The reigning champions had hoped the venue would set the stage for a return to form after disappointing outings at the last two races in Monaco and Baku.“It's been a difficult weekend because we are just lacking pace,” Mercedes boss Toto Wolff told Sky F1.“It looked much worse than in the end where we ended up but we just need to gain everywhere.”For Red Bull, it proved that their speed around the street layouts in Monaco and Baku had carried over to the more conventional layout of Paul Ricard, after having been beaten by Mercedes at similar venues in Portugal and Spain.Verstappen is hopeful he can get the job done and deal Mercedes their first defeat at the circuit on Sunday.“I’m so confident that we can have a good race car anyway, so it’s going to be a long race. It will be a tight battle but I’m looking forward to it.”(Reporting by Abhishek Takle; editing by Clare Fallon)\n",

She failed to deliver the times some had expected but got the job done, qualifying in four individual events the 200, 400, 800 and 1,500, which will be contested by the women for the first time at the Olympics.\"It's been fine. I haven't been super happy with my times but still feel like I'm in a good spot,\" Ledecky told reporters after the trials. \"Mission accomplished.\"\"It's not easy to get through the yardage I got through this week. It was good to just do it and get the job done, check the box move forward and not get too caught up in times.\"The gold medal winner in the 800 at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, Ledecky has ruled over the event for nearly a decade, posting the top 23 times of all time.There was never a moment on Saturday when that domination was in doubt as Ledecky left the field in her wake powering to victory in a time of eight minutes, 14.62 seconds - almost six seconds clear of 15-year-old Katie Grimes, who also earned a ticket to Tokyo with her second-place result.While it was business as usual for Ledecky, the evening also provided a major upset when Regan Smith, the 200-metres backstroke world record holder, finished third. She will not race the event in Tokyo.Smith had not been in top form coming into the meet but was still expected to grab one of the two spots. Instead it was Rhyan White getting to wall first in 2:05.73 ahead of Phoebe Bacon.Smith, however, had already secured her ticket to Tokyo with a win early in the 100 back.There were no slip-ups in the men's 100 butterfly, where world record holder Caeleb Dressel powered his way to a commanding win ahead of Tom Shields.After flirting with his own world mark of 49.50 in the preliminaries and semifinals, Dressel was expected to attack the record, but without being pushed he won in a time of 49.87.Dressel has now qualified in two individual events - the 100 butterfly and 100 freestyle - and is likely to add third to his work load in Japan after posting the top time of 21.51 seconds in the 50 freestyle semifinals.(Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto; Editing by William Mallard)\n",

Ambition, courage, the right attitude, mentality and belief in themselves,\" Sousa told reporters.Poland drew with Spain for only the second time, having won only once in their last 11 meetings. They lost their opener 2-1 to Slovakia so had to get something from the game.Alvaro Morata gave Spain the lead in the 25th minute but Poland, who had hit the woodwork twice in the first half, deservedly drew level with a towering header from captain Robert Lewandowski in the 54th. [L5N2O10IZ]\"We corrected things in the second half regarding... attitude and intensity from our players\" Sousa said, adding that his team managed to press higher and be more dynamic in transitions after the break.\"If we can play against one of the best teams in the world, like Spain, the way we played today, we can play like that every game. Then we can win, or we can lose, but like that it's much easier, we can get much closer to winning matches,\" Sousa said.He also praised their 32-year-old Bayern Munich striker Lewandowski for his performance and leadership skills.\"Seeing a leader like Robert winning all the challenges, interacting with team mates, shows the right mentality and could lead (to us) advancing to the knockout stage,\" he said.\"It's a boy who always works in training to make sure he has this feeling with the goal but he understands that in our national team he doesn't have the same dynamics and the same players as at Bayern Munich.\"Lewandowski has scored only three times for Poland in major tournaments including Saturday's goal against Spain. The pressure on him to perform has increased during the tournament but Sousa did not fear it would be too much for the 2021 European Golden Boot winner.\"Lewandowski makes the team stronger as a collective,\" Sousa added.(Reporting by Tommy Lund and Bartosz Dabrowski; additional reporting by Anita Kobylinska; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n",

Could have been better but taking more positive out of it than anything else.\"He heads into the final round with momentum on his side, despite four bogeys on the day, finishing the afternoon in San Diego with a 50-foot eagle putt on the par-3 18, in front of a roaring crowd that was frequently absent from tournaments in 2020 due to the pandemic.\"A year ago that would have been a very boring eagle with a few people going nuts. But that was nice to see everyone back,\" he said.To win, he will have to fend off a stacked field that includes defending champion Bryson DeChambeau (68) and four-time major winner Rory McIlroy (67), who trailed the lead by two strokes.His sole major triumph, winning the British Open in 2010, serves as inspiration.\"I was too dumb really when I won the Open to get nervous and to know what was going on,\" he told reporters. \"You definitely grow playing major championships.

      "(Reuters) -Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen lifted himself into a league of his own as he beat title rival Lewis Hamilton to pole position with a blinding lap in qualifying for the French Grand Prix.The 23-year-old, the only driver to go faster than the one minute 30 seconds mark, set the timing screens alight with a one minute 29.990 second lap around the 5.8-km Paul Ricard track.That was good enough to beat Hamilton by a handy 0.258 seconds, with the Mercedes driver lining up alongside the Red Bull on the front row.Four points separate the pair in the overall standings.“So far it has been a really positive weekend at a track where it has been a bit difficult for us,” said Verstappen after taking his second pole position of the season and the fifth of his career.“No points are scored today but it is a great day and we have to finish it off tomorrow to get 25 points that we lost in Baku,” added the Dutchman who crashed out of the lead in the last race in Azerbaijan with a blown tyre while heading for an almost certain win.Mercedes had led every practice and qualifying session for the two races held at the Paul Ricard track since the circuit joined the calendar in 2018.Hamilton, who won both from pole, had gone into this weekend looking to bounce back after picking up only seven points over the last two races.But even with his team’s practice and qualifying dominance at an end, the seven time champion will be happy to line up on the front row from where he has a good chance of taking the fight to Verstappen on Sunday.“We've got a race on our hands and we're loving the battle,” said Hamilton. “We're going to keep pushing, keep fighting and giving it everything.”BOTTAS THIRDValtteri Bottas, who has swapped chassis with Hamilton this weekend, will line up third alongside fourth-placed Sergio Perez, winner for Red Bull in Baku.The fired-up Finn, who heads into the weekend having failed to score in the last two races and with speculation surrounding his Mercedes future, has been in the mix throughout the weekend and was a tenth of a second off his team mate’s best.Carlos Sainz was fifth for Ferrari ahead of Frenchman Pierre Gasly who will line up sixth in his AlphaTauri for his home race.Charles Leclerc, who put his Ferrari on pole for the last two races, was seventh.Alpine’s Esteban Ocon, a Frenchman driving for a French team, will start his home race 11th.Saturday’s qualifying session was interrupted by two red flags.Japanese rookie Yuki Tsunoda caused the first stoppage three minutes into the hour-long session when he lost control of his AlphaTauri at the first corner and ended up in the barriers.Mick Schumacher brought the red flags out for the second time in the dying seconds of the opening phase of qualifying, when the German spun off into the barriers.The 22-year-old Haas driver will still line up a career-best 15th.(Reporting by Abhishek Takle; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Ken Ferris)\n",

      "LONDON: Harry Kane (top) is England’s captain, chief goalscorer and talisman, which is great when things are going well, but when the striker is off the boil, as he was horribly again against Scotland, his sluggishness seems to permeate the whole team.England were desperately short of ideas, invention and energy, managing a solitary shot on goal in a 0-0 draw that was a just reward for a Scottish team who were the exact opposite, making up easily for a supposed gulf in class with their commitment and organisation.On Sunday, Kane was taken off late in the 1-0 win over Croatia, looking out on his feet, with some suggesting the hot conditions may have played a part in his sluggish display.On Friday, on a wet, cool night he looked even worse and was hooked after 73 minutes of largely purposeless toil.In the first half he sat deep, as has become his more normal position for his club Tottenham Hotspur, but was unable to find a way to influence the game either in collecting the ball or moving it forward.Kane pushed up more after the break but was handled with ease by Scotland’s central defenders.There can be few players whose standards swing so dramatically, seemingly dependent on their fitness. As England were bundled out of Euro 2016 by Iceland, Kane played as if he was carrying a bag of cement on his back.Two years later he was the leading scorer at the World Cup, his goals and all-powerful front-running display driving England to the semi-finals.Back on home soil, however, he again looks slow and on Friday he was unable to bring his influence to bear in any way.Pundit Graeme Souness said Kane looked “a shadow of the player we know he is. He looks leggy, he doesn’t look himself, he looks jaded... he needs to wake up.”Manager Gareth Southgate replaced him with Marcus Rashford, having also thrown on Jack Grealish after an hour, but they were the only changes he made despite the team seemingly desperately needing a shake up.England managed one shot on target all night – a decent effort by Mason Mount – and though John Stones hit a post with an early header, they rarely otherwise looked like unlocking an impressive Scotland defence.Far too many players took the easy, safe option and, though England were right to try to dampen the frenetic early exchanges as the fired-up Scots tore into them, they failed miserably to use their increased possession to do anything more than spray the ball laterally.The result is no disaster for England, who have four points in the bag ahead of their final game against Group D leaders the Czech Republic on Tuesday, but the performance should worry Southgate.He is not a man to panic but, as he has become more established in his position, that calmness has too often developed into a conservatism that has left fans and pundits scratching their heads.Unless Kane is carrying an injury he is almost certain to lead the line against the Czechs, and beyond, but if England are to have any chance of going deep into the tournament, their number nine will need to rediscover that lost verve, or make way for someone who still has it. — Reuters\n",

      "MUNICH, Germany (Reuters) - Germany coach Joachim Loew punched the air when Robin Gosens headed in their fourth goal at the far post in their Euro 2020 Group F 4-2 win over Portugal on Saturday, knowing his attacking gamble with his in-form left back had paid off in spades.Gosens played a sensational game on the biggest stage, intimidating the Portuguese defence with his speed and power down the left wing as he charged through again and again to set up two goals and score another.\"I don't know if it was the game of a lifetime for him, maybe he still has to play that,\" Loew said.\"But an amazing performance from him. He worked very hard and on top of that he was a constant threat up front as well. That is exactly what we needed today.\"The 26-year-old Gosens, who has played his entire professional career outside Germany and unusually has not come out of the country's youth system, was one of the best in their opening defeat against France but had faced a tighter backline.Against the Portuguese, he had free rein to display his full set of skills and live up to the title of his autobiography 'It is worth dreaming'.The Atalanta defender was crucial to Loew's plan to attack more often and faster than in their opener, and his constant runs gradually gave forwards Kai Havertz and Serge Gnabry more space to operate inside the box.Gosens did not take long to ignite, thundering in a flying volley in the fifth minute before his effort was ruled offside, but in an almost identical move he volleyed into the box in the 35th to force Ruben Dias to stab the ball into his own goal.The defender, a psychology student in his spare time who prefers books to video games, kept up his frenzied runs, remaining a constant source of concern for Portugal's defence.He set up Havertz for Germany's third goal six minutes after the restart, cutting back for his team mate to tap in.Gosens was the key to Germany turning the game around with three goals from the 35th minute until he headed in to make it 4-1 on the hour and cap a memorable performance.By the time he scored Germany had had 11 attempts on goal, compared to just two in the entire game against France, and most of those started with Gosens.The Germans could now seal their spot in the next round when they face Hungary on Wednesday.(Reporting by Karolos Grohmann; editing by Clare Fallon)\n",

He will now return home to spend time with his family.The Inter Milan playmaker had to be revived on the pitch after collapsing in the 43rd minute of Denmark’s Group B opener against Finland last Saturday.The match resumed nearly two hours later, after Eriksen was rushed to hospital, and Denmark lost 1-0.The Danes were beaten 2-1 by Belgium on Thursday in a game that was interrupted after 10 minutes for a round of applause in support of Eriksen.Denmark must beat Russia in their final game tomorrow to stand a chance of reaching the last 16.The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a device that can detect and correct heart rhythm disorders.Like its better-known cousin, the pacemaker, an ICD is made up of one or more leads and a small housing placed under the skin.The leads can be inserted through a blood vessel directly into the heart or placed under the skin, in contact with the chest wall. — AFP\n",

      "SEVILLE, Spain (Reuters) - Spain wing back Jordi Alba has dismissed suggestions their Euro 2020 team lack the passion and intensity of previous Spanish sides after they stuttered to a 1-1 draw with Poland that leaves them third in Group E with no guarantee of advancing.The Spaniards are on two points after draws with Sweden and Poland, and Saturday's clash suggested they still have some way to go to find their top form as they perpare to face Slovakia.Just as they did in their dull scoreless draw with Sweden, Spain dominated possession but struggled in front of goal as Gerard Moreno missed a penalty and Alvaro Morata, despite scoring, wasted a number of good second-half chances.\"I really think that in terms of the intensity and the determination, you really can't question that, but of course there are plenty of things to improve, that's the same for all teams, but I think we're all doing a fantastic job,\" he told reporters.\"We're annoyed with the result but if we continue working hard I'm sure that the result will come. On Wednesday we have another match, another final, and we're going to try and continue giving all that we have to win and to get through to the next round.\"Gerard Moreno hit a post with a second-half penalty and Morata allowed a number of decent chances go begging, but for the most part Spain were once again pedestrian in possession and lacking bite in attack.The result leaves coach Luis Enrique, who has shown great faith in Morata so far, with a lot of thinking to do ahead of Spain's final group game against Slovakia.\"Morata has done many things well and in the first game, the goal is something that comes in handy for the striker -- it's a pity that we have not been able to do more,\" he told Spanish broadcaster Telecinco.The 51-year-old declined to offer a deeper analysis of what went wrong as the Spanish attack came up short once again.\"I have a tremendous desire to see the game again to analyse it in depth, the feelings right now are not the best. Perhaps we have been superior, but not enough,\" he said.\"As a coach I have had to solve problems, we have to come in four days to give joy to the fans who deserve it and if we don't win we will be out.\"(Reporting by Philip O'Connor; editing by Ken Ferris)\n",

It should make our guys proud.\"Attila Fiola put the hosts ahead just before halftime but Antoine Griezmann equalised in the 66th minute to move France on to four points after two games and on track for the last 16.Hungary's unexpected point kept alive their slim hopes and they must now beat another heavyweight, Germany, on Wednesday to have a chance of advancing to the knockout stage.\"We need to keep our feet on the ground. I'm not arrogant and saying we'll win in Munich, but we will do our best to make it a match,\" said Rossi, who took a swipe at critics who said he should have called up different players for the finals.Hungary's Puskas Arena, the only venue to allow capacity crowds at Euro 2020, was packed with 65,000 fans screaming out in joy at their team's performance and Rossi said the supporters deserved the result against France.\"A crowd, fans like we have at the stadium today, or against Portugal, or even five years ago during Euro 2016 -- we have unique fans so that's why we work to give them satisfaction,\" he added, before turning to the future for the national team.\"We are in a growth process,\" Rossi said.Several of Hungary's best players are just hitting their 20s, including injured midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai, the team's most promising young player.Midfielder Laszlo Kleinheisler, chosen as UEFA's Man of the Match, said he expected the team to gain strength from the \"incredible experience\" going forward.\"We levelled up with the French for the entire match,\" Kleinheisler said. \"I trust this will empower us for the Germany match and I hope we can achieve a good result.\"(Reporting by Marton Dunai @mdunai; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n",

      "GLASGOW: Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic admitted his side face an embarrassing early exit from Euro 2020 unless they drastically improve after a 1-1 draw against the Czech Republic in Glasgow.The World Cup finalists have just one point from their opening two games and need to beat Scotland on home soil at Hampden on Tuesday to maintain hope of a place in the last 16.Patrik Schick broke Scottish hearts on Monday with two goals to beat the hosts 2-0, including an incredible strike from nearly 50 metres that will go down as one of the best in European Championship history.The Bayer Leverkusen forward had a much simpler task from the penalty spot to open the scoring, but Ivan Perisic’s stunning strike early in the second half maintained Croatia’s chances of reaching the knockout stage.“We need energy, we are struggling,” said Dalic, who was heralded a national hero for Croatia’s run to the final in Russia three years ago.“We had a bad start, we were slow and we were trying to set unnecessary pressure, we were not compact. But, after the goal we played better. Everything is still in our hands.”Coach Jaroslav Silhavy’s wild celebrations at the final whistle showed who were the happier side with a point, with the Czechs likely to have already done enough to secure a place in the last 16 thanks to their four points.“I was surprised they didn’t attack us in the first half, they let us play and we made use of that, but we have to be more dangerous up front,” said Silhavy.“I have to thank the guys. It is a really precious point against such a strong opponent. We’ll see what the maths will show us, if it’s enough.”Croatia upset Argentina and England on their road to the World Cup final, but have looked a pale imitation of that side so far this tournament without Ivan Rakitic and Mario Mandzukic, who have retired from international football.The ageing Luka Modric and Perisic remain by a distance their biggest threats, but both the veterans were critical of their side.“There is a bitter taste after this match, as we didn’t win. We entered the match really disorganised,” said Modric.“We looked better in the second half. We scored that goal and we could have scored even more, but unfortunately we didn’t win. Now, we have to defeat Scotland to go through.”“Everyone in the team has to give more that this, otherwise we will go home after the group stage,” said Perisic. “We have a chance, we can go through, but we need to be better.” — AFP\n",

      "The recent spike in Covid-19 cases worldwide should not be taken lightly as the new variants are more infectious.Even with the vaccination roll out, wearing a face mask is still considered a necessity as the virus continues to mutate.Double-masking has become a topic of conversation to enhance protection by improving filtration.It also fits more closely against the face for a better seal.However, one of the disadvantages of double-masking is poor breathability which will cause frequent removal of the mask and hence, increases exposure.ProXmask is the better alternative to double-masking and it also has an added advantage.Designed and engineered with ProX technology, ProXmask is able to inactivate 99% of SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19, other coronaviruses as well as influenza viruses and bacteria.The antiviral technology involves the presence of active positive charges on the fabric, as binding sites for viruses.Upon contact with the fabric, virus cells that are negatively charged are neutralised, leading to the rapid destruction of its glycoprotein layers.ProXmask is also water repellent, offers better breathability and enhanced microfiltration technology, achieving above 95% BFE (bacteria filtration efficiency) and PFE (particle filtration efficiency) versus 85.4% in double-masking.Its water repellent feature enables effective shielding from respiratory droplets containing viruses and bacteria.It is washable and reusable up to 60 times, which makes it an environmental friendly product.ProXmask is also the first fabric mask in Malaysia to obtain product certification from Sirim QAS International.It also carries CE marking for the European Economic Area and is US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) registered.Those interested in becoming a ProXmask distributor and sales agent can email info@proxmask.com or visit www.prox.com.my\n",

      "THE Bukit Kukus paired roads – one of the most difficult projects both in design and construction – will only be completed by the end of this year.Penang infrastructure committee chairman Zairil Khir Johari said work was progressing well and the project would be completed in December, two months later than the earlier October deadline.“Yes, it is one of the most difficult road projects to build but we have overcome all major obstacles, which have been identified and rectified, ” he said.Zairil said while there were several delays since the project began in 2018, the estimated cost would remain the same at RM545.6mil.In a press conference in early April, Zairil had said geological fault lines were discovered at certain sections of the hilly area of the project, contributing to its delay.He had said since the issue needed to be rectified, the project, which was originally scheduled to be completed in May, would be pushed to October this year.The project consists of three sections.Penang Island City Council (MBPP) is responsible for the construction of 2.8km of the stretch that costs RM275.6mil.Two more developers are responsible for the remaining 1.4km (RM150mil) and 0.7km (RM120mil) stretches.The works include the junction improvement of Lebuhraya Thean Tek, widening of the existing Jalan Bukit Kukus, construction of new roads and an elevated road from Jalan Paya Terubong to Jalan Tun Sardon and an intersection of new paired road to Lebuh Bukit Jambul with a dedicated right-turn ramp.Several slope mitigation projects along Jalan Tun Sardon were also completed.On the maintenance of the project after completion, Zairil said it would most likely come under the Public Works Department as MBPP was only the project implementer.“A final decision on this will only be made after a discussion with all parties, including the state government.”Zairil, however, added that any defects of the project would be the responsibility of the contractor since there was a two-year liability period.The project had its fair share of mishaps since it began in 2018.In October 2018, 14 beams meant to be a platform for a section of the highway fell, leading to the Department of Safety and Health issuing a stop-work order.Two days later, a landslide mangled 12 container cabins, killing nine foreign workers and injuring four.The main contractor for the project, Syarikat Yuta Maju Sdn Bhd, was fined RM35, 000 in February last year for failing to provide a safe work procedure.Meanwhile, state Fire and Rescue Department director Saadon Moktar said his personnel visited the site recently to look at the work in progress.“It was merely to survey the area and how rescue operations could be carried in the event of a major accident.“We are still studying all the angles and the safety measures, ” he said.Saadon said they briefed the contractor on the objective of the visit and also made some recommendations on safety measures to be taken.\n",

So they went through another health check in late May.“We had requested that the residents be inoculated at the home instead of at a vaccination centre, as it would be difficult for us to look into their needs while travelling.”Chew said most of the residents had comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes.The 11 workers at the home had been vaccinated in March.A spokesperson for the mobile team said they had covered five homes for the aged, the other four being Rejang Nursing Care Centre, Love Care Centre at KPJ, Apha Home Centre and the High Q Senior Enrichment Centre.\n",

      "AN OLD folks home in Bandar Mahkota Cheras, Kajang is under quarantine after seven residents, including the home supervisor, were found to be Covid-19 positive.The home’s supervisor, who only wanted to be identified as Siah, said in a phone call from a hospital ward that testing for the home’s 18 residents and caregivers was done after a resident admitted to hospital tested positive for the virus.“The Hulu Langat district health office then carried out tests on the rest of us.“The seven who tested positive are being treated at Cheras Rehabilitation Hospital.“I have instructed my staff that no visitors be allowed for the time being unless for emergencies, ” he said.Kajang assemblyman Hee Loy Sian, who visited the home to deliver food packs to residents, said his office was notified of the situation last Sunday night.Following this, Kajang councillor Lim Kim Eng visited the home.The affected residents were sent to hospital after Lim’s visit.Hee said this was the second home in Kajang to have Covid-19 positive cases this year. The first was a children’s daycare centre.He reminded operators of such homes that they could only get a licence to operate after the facility had been inspected for fire safety and cleared by the local authority and district health office.“These centres must also get approval from their neighbours if they are operating within a housing area.“There is an urgent need for such care facilities among the community but there are not enough government-approved ones.“The public is left with little choice as it would be dangerous to leave elderly folk and young kids unattended while their parents and caregivers are at work, ” said Hee, who is also state tourism and environment committee chairman.While the elderly care home in this case had acted quickly to contain the spread of the virus, there was a high possibility of unreported cases at illegally operated centres, he said.\n",

      "SOME 16, 000 residents of the Desa Rejang Public Housing flats in Setapak Jaya, Kuala Lumpur hope that generous Malaysians will step in to provide fresh food for the community as they go under lockdown for the next two weeks.Residents living in the 12 blocks of flats have been placed under enhanced movement control order from June 18 to July 1, after health authorities confirmed a sharp rise in Covid-19 positive cases there within a short period of time.Desa Rejang Residents Association chairman Mohd Noor Md Tahir said while the Welfare Department (JKM) would be assisting by contributing dry provisions, sourcing for fresh food remains a challenge.“JKM will only be providing basic provisions once a week for each family, but we will have to source for other food items ourselves.“As there are many residents here, it would be difficult to bring in enough food for everyone.“Some residents managed to buy provisions a day before the lockdown but it would not last the entire period, ” he said, adding that there was also worry that the enhanced MCO could be extended beyond the two weeks.He said although residents were concerned, most have stayed calm as barbed wire fencing was installed around all the blocks yesterday morning.“We were informed that the Titiwangsa district health office will be carrying out targeted screening for residents, starting with senior citizens, children under two as well as other vulnerable groups.“There has been a spike in cases since last month, some of which were due to residents visiting other homes.“Most of the recent cases, however, were from those who had contracted the virus in their workplaces and later infected their families, ” Mohd Noor said.On Wednesday, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said that out of 3, 512 residents screened in the locality, 264 confirmed cases were reported with the positivity rate in the area at 7.52%.\n",

      "The Johor government’s latest economic stimulus package has received the thumbs up from various groups, and is seen as “timely assistance” during this lockdown.Johor Tourist Guides Association chairman Jimmy Leong Wie Kong said the one-off initiative for tourist guides, homestays, budget hotels and travel agencies based in the state was a reflection of the government’s commitment.“We thank the state for looking after the welfare of the tourism industry here during these trying times.“This initiative would not have materialised if there were no consultations between industry players and the state government, ” he said.Leong also thanked Johor tourism, youth and sports committee chairman Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi for continuously engaging with the industry.Johor Indian Petty Traders and Small Business Association chairman D. Ravindran said the one-off incentive for canteen operators, barbers, budget hotels, small and medium enterprises as well as school van and bus drivers was among the initiatives that would benefit its members.He also welcomed the assistance under e-Kasih, the RM200 vouchers for those in the B40 group and the Gerobok Makanan food aid programme.“The rent exemption for those living at people’s housing projects and deferment of business licence fees until December are much appreciated too, ” he said.Ravindran added that while he was grateful for the RM500 one-off initiative for some 10, 000 people who had lost their jobs, he believed that the actual number was much higher.“We are of the opinion that the figure is over 10, 000 and the state should do what’s necessary to get more accurate statistics, ” he said.Meanwhile, Johor Malay Non-Governmental Organisations Coalition Council president Zaini Atan said the economic stimulus package was timely, especially with the extension of the lockdown.“We also welcome the state’s move to buy its own vaccines to expedite efforts to achieve herd immunity, ” he added.Leong echoed his views, saying: “Johor is unique because of its proximity to Singapore and its economic interdependence with the island republic.“So getting the population here vaccinated early is particularly important for the state.”Last week, the Johor government unveiled its third economic stimulus package worth RM241mil as part of efforts to step up its Covid-19 pandemic management initiatives and provide financial relief to the people.Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad had said that the Ihsan Johor 3.0 financial aid package with 33 initiatives, was aimed at empowering the state’s management of the pandemic and strengthening the social safety net.Since the first movement control order in March last year, the state government has allocated a total of RM550.95mil through three economic stimulus packages, benefitting over 1.5 million recipients.\n",

      "THE association managing a Hindu cemetery in Ampang that complained about a proposed anaerobic digestion (AD) plant project next to it, has claimed that the local council did not discuss matters with it.Hindu Cemetery Crematorium Ampang Association said Ampang Jaya Municipal Council (MPAJ) did not inform the relevant parties about the plans to build the plant and a food court in Jalan Kerja Ayer Lama.The AD’s location is in front of the 60-year-old Ampang/Ulu Kelang Hindu Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur.The site is currently the parking facility for cemetery visitors.The food court is set to be located less than 50m away from the AD plant.Association secretary Saradha K. Suppiah (pic) said MPAJ did not inform the association about the plans nor called the committee for a meeting as claimed.“MPAJ had only addressed a letter to a worker at the cemetery instead of sending an official notice to the committee about a meeting last year to discuss this proposal.“How can this be when we have had many correspondences with MPAJ over cemetery matters since 2012? We are the rightful party that should have been notified.“How are we supposed to voice our concerns or objections when we have not even been informed in the first place?” she questioned.Saradha said the cemetery was established by her late father, K. Suppiah and it was gazetted in 1962.Besides the cemetery, Suppiah was also instrumental in building the Sri Raja Rajeswary Temple, Ulu Klang Recreational Club (UKRC) and SJK(T) Ampang.Saradha said they were not aware of the AD project until the hoardings were installed at the site and construction started at the end of May.“We have sent an official letter to MPAJ requesting a meeting on this matter.“Until then, MPAJ must put a hold on the project,” she said, adding that the burial ground would be temporarily closed for upgrading and maintenance works.MPAJ had said the AD was one way to tackle excessive food waste by processing it into compost for fertiliser and the biogas produced would generate electricity.A StarMetro report on June 14 quoted MPAJ press relations officer Norhayati Ahmad saying that a coordination meeting for the development of the food court and AD plant was held on July 7 last year, and was attended by the affected parties.She had said that no one objected to the project and all agreed to share the parking facilities, adding that the AD would take up 22% of the 0.15ha land.Norhayati said the RM4.56mil project was currently in the initial stages of construction by MPAJ, in collaboration with the Housing and Local Government Ministry.In 2019, the AD project was proposed to be in Jalan Mamanda 27, next to Kondominium Kojaya Ampang, but it was changed last year to its current location following residents’ protest.The food court will house traders currently operating in Lorong Kerja Ayer Lama.Meanwhile, former Cabinet minister Tan Sri Dr Rais Yatim, who has been an Ampang Jaya resident since 1975, called on MPAJ to provide information on the project to residents in all neighbourhoods in the area.“It is not just the immediate community who are affected. It is only right that all residents are consulted,” said Rais who is Dewan Negara president.He said MPAJ should address everyone’s concerns about the project, especially over any potential dangers of the AD plant.MPAJ councillor R. Moganraj has planned to arrange a meeting among all concerned parties after the lockdown is lifted.Ampang MP Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin, who is also Housing and Local Government Minister, was reported earlier as saying that the project was expected to be completed by January next year.The new food court will have 17 stalls and two kiosks, toilet, nursing room, surau and carpark.\n",

      "Fathers are making the most of trying times to connect with their children and strengthen bonds. StarMetro shares the joys and challenges these men face in conjunction with Fathers Day tomorrow.FATHERS Day is more than just an occasion to get dad a new tie or treat him to a nice meal.For some, when reflecting on the best gift they could have given their own fathers, the common response is “quality time spent together”.Devoting precious moments together is even more important now with the Covid-19 pandemic in our midst, as strong paternal ties with children are precious and needed. The challenges, however, are immense, especially for fathers who are heads of the household or even single dads.Tough loveFor Yong Yek Ming, 56, being a parent to two autistic sons Wei Jie, 21, and Wei Xiang, 20, has changed his perception of fatherhood.“It is definitely much more challenging being a single father.“To me it is ‘parenthood’ because I was brought up in a family where men and women are equal at home.“My mum was a strict parent and I did household chores as well.“There is not much difference between a single father and single mother because both have to do more for their children, ” he told StarMetro.Taking care of one autistic child is equivalent to caring for 10 children, said Yek Ming, a divorcee.Wei Jie, is non-verbal while Wei Xiang has high-functioning autism, both in the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).“I have to spend more time with Wei Jie because he is prone to temper tantrums and needs to be taught skills like toilet training and preparing food.“My objective is to make him independent so he can take care of himself but he requires long-term care.“The worst case scenario is getting him a caregiver in future, ” he added.Yek Ming, an engineer by training and a businessman, said it was imperative to create more awareness of autism in society.During the early stages, he said it was difficult as he would get rude looks and comments from the public whenever he took his sons out.“I was put off by it. I received comments like ‘if you cannot control your child, stay at home’.“But in 2015, I made up my mind to open up about autism, ” he said.It was then that Yek Ming and his sons became part of the inspiration behind award-winning Malaysian movie Redha in 2016, directed by Tunku Mona Riza.The movie was selected to represent Malaysia in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 89th Academy Awards in 2017.It tells the story of a family’s struggle to confront the harsh realities of raising a child disabled by a condition they knew little about.For children with autism, quality time is a subjective term, said Yek Ming.“My sons are happy to get more time with me.“The problem is I cannot get them to socialise with other people because they lack social skills and I cannot keep them at home too long either, ” he said, adding that if it was not for the lockdown, the boys would be learning life skills — cooking, handling household chores and managing money — at Parents Resource 4 Autism Centre in Sri Petaling.How does Yek Ming cope with a dual-parent role?“I cannot be as good as a mother in some aspects, ” he said.“Mothers have innate love and compassion.“But for me, there is no separation between the roles of mother and father.“If a father does not know how to cook, he can learn from YouTube now.”Recalibrating prioritiesBeing a single father for Afif Afham Arsad, 38, means reassessing how minutes are spent in a day.When he was married, the former pilot was free to focus on his career, find a side hustle and had more time for activities with his children Mikael, 12, and nine-year-old twin daughters Thalia and Tianna.“But it’s interesting how limitations and difficulties teach me perspective and focus.“Being a single father, I have managed to dig up extra minutes in a day.“I love that I can bring my children along in my journey of work and design, involving them in the process.“Sometimes, the insights from them actually match the feedback I receive from my peers, ” he said.Afif Afham was forced to change careers, from being a pilot for 17 years to a user experience/user interface (UX/UI) designer, because of the Covid-19 pandemic.While he can easily focus on learning something new from scratch on his own, he chooses to get his children involved in his new career.“I taught them design while learning it myself, and incorporated design-thinking elements in their schoolwork and game time.“To see them putting all these non-traditional education elements together is so heart-warming, ” he said.Afif Afham highly values the routine of running his household along with his children.“We don’t call it chores.“It’s just things we need to do to maintain a home filled with love.“For example, if I say ‘shut it down’ at about 7pm, the kids set the house up for night-time.“It’s like having a personal assistant but with chubby cheeks to pinch, ” he joked.Being a single parent is also about having good mental health.“I’m wired differently so I cannot parent like others, ” he explained.“I am grateful that my children and I are on the same frequency about this.“I use my design elements and purposeful games to educate them about critical thinking and resilience (in life).”But he admitted that sometimes his professional and parenting responsibilities could get overwhelming and test his patience.“It definitely does break me every now and then but it is just smart to accept reality and recover quickly, ” he said.Afif Afham’s message to all single fathers is to have a clear goal in life.“My life decisions are centred around my children’s well-being and safety.“There were overseas job opportunities last year that my friends thought I should grab quickly but those offers meant I had to be apart from my children so I declined.“More importantly, get all the help you can when you need it.“My family has been extremely helpful.“Parenting is not about being a flawless homemaker.“A child’s marinara-stained white shirt when cooking together has more value than an Instagram-worthy dining table, ” he said.Newbie daddyAfter his soon-to-be two-year-old daughter Liberty came into his world, Rithan Vijay, 41, learned to appreciate things he had forgotten.Fatherhood, so far, has been a rollercoaster ride of emotions.“I am still learning something new every day.“I have this new sense of responsibility, which I never had before, and I am constantly reminding myself it’s not about me anymore, ” said Rithan, adding that sacrificing frequent meet-ups with friends was part of the package of being a new parent.Rithan, who does freelance work from home, is also a musician and former talent division head at Astro.He said there is no manual for fatherhood.“It is just like music, you learn the rules and then you improvise.“I just pray that I can be the best person I can be for my daughter, ” he added.The pandemic has given him a chance to spend more time with Liberty.“I am grateful for this and I try to adapt to what she likes to do.“We watch cartoons in the mornings — our current favourites are Lucas The Spider and Minuscule.“She helps me feed our cat, dog and fishes and she always wants to complete tasks on her own.“It’s like having my own personal helper, ” he laughed, adding that most of the time, she likes reading, colouring or painting.“My wife deserves the utmost respect because it’s not easy being on demand 24/7.”Rithan said he now values time and feels a fierce kind of love he never thought existed.“I want to shield this little person from the evils of this world, although I know that is impossible.“I got to know my self-worth and moved away from things which do not make me happy anymore, ” he said.“I have to be well in order to set a good example for my daughter.”\n",

      "Morning and night market traders in Kuala Lumpur have been facing one uncertainty after another since the movement control order was first implemented in March 18 last year.With the government’s standard operating procedure (SOP) often lacking clarity, these traders feel that they have been left out.During the MCO last year, only indoor markets were allowed to stay open.To soften the blow, open-air traders were given RM500 under the Wilayah Cakna initiative by the Federal Territories Ministry.At that time, market traders understood that it was necessary to close in order to flatten the Covid-19 infection curve.The problems started during MCO 2.0 in January, when outdoor markets were allowed to open but night markets were closed.Night market traders could not understand why they had been sidelined as both markets operated under seemingly similar SOP.The Kuala Lumpur Night Market Association appealed the ban, which the government lifted in February with the condition that night markets would have to strictly comply with the SOP.This continued until the latest lockdown that began on June 1.According to the National Security Council’s (NSC) SOP dated June 2, all markets are allowed to operate from 6am to 2pm, subject to the local authority’s approval.In the case of Kuala Lumpur, it was decided that while indoor markets could operate, outdoor markets would remain closed.The move by Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) has not gone down well with the affected traders, who lament that in Selangor, outdoor markets are allowed to open.To make matters worse, even roadside traders in Kuala Lumpur, who are registered under the free trading zone programme introduced by Federal Territories Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa, have been allowed to operate.Their reasoning is simple; if roadside hawkers are allowed to operate, why not outdoor and night markets?After all, organisers of both markets had adopted a stricter SOP even before the lockdown, which included hiring People’s Volunteer Corps (Rela) personnel, implementing one-way traffic flow and making temperature checks and MySejahtera registration compulsory.It is only logical that markets adopting the same SOP be treated equally.Many traders I spoke to expressed their unhappiness over what they called “double standards”.Most market traders survive on their daily earnings, and missing even a week of business would greatly affect their income.Endless appeals to allow outdoor and night markets to open have been channelled to the relevant authorities.However, the indisputable fact that Covid-19 infections must be reduced urgently continues to drown out their voices.While market traders may seem rebellious in their push for the decision to be reversed, what they actually want is to be treated fairly.As a start, NSC should come up with a clear decision on whether outdoor and night markets should be allowed to open, instead of leaving it to the respective local authorities.This will ensure that all states are on the same page.Local authorities can, however, be in charge of ensuring these markets comply with the SOP, failing which they will be ordered to close.Kuala Lumpur Night Market Association secretary Charles James Roy recently suggested that DBKL allow night market traders to operate on roadsides (similar to hawkers under the free trading zone programme) as it should be workable and would improve their livelihoods.A better strategy should be taken by the government in regard to market operations.Should there be another lockdown, the plight of market traders, both outdoor and indoor, must be taken into consideration.Meanwhile, four mobile vaccination trucks will make their way to Pasar Borong Kuala Lumpur tomorrow to vaccinate traders and workers there.Some 1, 000 people at the wholesale market will benefit from the programme under the FT Ministry.This also spells good news for business operators who will feel more safe when getting their supplies from the wholesale market.\n",

      "IT is all clear for the public to do their marketing at the Perak Road Market from today after all the traders completed their Covid-19 tests and the place was completely sanitised.State local government committee chairman Jagdeep Singh Deo said during the one-week closure, all the traders took Covid-19 tests and those tested positive have remained quarantined.“A total of 69 screenings had been done for traders registered with the Penang Island City Council and their employees.“Out of that, only 11 positive cases were detected as of June 17, ” he said during a press conference at the market yesterday.Jagdeep said the closure of public premises after positive cases was in line with the state government’s efforts to prioritise public health and security during the pandemic.“After being advised by the Health Ministry, both city councils in Penang will help close down premises if positive cases were detected.“We have to be quick when there is a positive case. Those involved have to do their screenings and get the results, so that we can make a decision if the premises should be closed, or opened after consulting the Health Ministry.“We will also close premises when we find people do not adhere to the standard operating procedures (SOP).“In fact, we have closed a few markets since the first movement control order.“It is not an easy decision to make but we have to do it. The health of the public is of utmost importance, ” he said.Since March last year, several public markets including at Taman Free School, Batu Maung and Jelutong on the island and in Penaga, Bagan Ajam and Bukit Mertajam on the Penang mainland had been closed temporarily after Covid-19 cases were detected.Meanwhile, MBPP mayor Datuk Yew Tung Seang said the MBPP pig slaughterhouse in Jalan Sungai was allowed to reopen yesterday..Also present were Jelutong MP RSN Rayer and Batu Lanchang assemblyman Ong Ah Teong.\n",

      "THE Penang Water Supply Corporation (PBAPP) has taken immediate action to address low water pressure woes faced by some 200 residents in Taman Seri Putera, Nibong Tebal.Its chief executive officer Datuk Jaseni Maidinsa said the corporation would launch an investigation into the issue with short and long-term plans in the pipeline.“We will ascertain the primary cause of the daily low water pressure.“The corporation’s Operations Department has been instructed to carry out action immediately.“Pressure loggers will be installed at the key water pipeline into the housing area to precisely measure and monitor the water pressure.“Underground water leakages, valve failures or ‘air locks’ in the pipeline in the neighbourhood and nearby areas will be checked.“Water consumption in the neighbourhood will be monitored to verify that there are no water thefts or abnormally high water consumption in any premises, ” he said in a statement.Dr Jaseni added that PBAPP’s customer service personnel would contact as many affected residents as possible to record and confirm their grievances.“If it is ascertained that the residents’ complaints of daily low water pressure are valid, the Operations Department may implement short-term solutions to assist them.“Among those solutions are to loop up all ‘dead ends’ in the water reticulation systems at relevant locations to improve water distribution pressure in Taman Seri Putera.“Existing water supply networks may be re-configured to improve water distribution pressure in the neighbourhood, including repairing or replacing leaking pipelines if detected.“If pressure loggers detect any water supply interruptions exceeding 24 hours, water tankers will be deployed to supply water to the residents, ” said Jaseni.He said in view of the growing water demand in south Seberang Prai in tandem with increasing socioeconomic activities, PBAPP had long-term plans to maintain good water supply services in the district.“We will construct and commission a pumping station in Permatang Pauh with a capacity of 114 million litres per day (MLD) to boost water supply pressures in the district.“A water treatment plant in Sungai Kerian with a capacity of 250 MLD will also be constructed and commissioned, as related to the implementation of the Sungai Perak Raw Water Transfer Scheme, ” he said.In March, residents in Taman Seri Putera claimed they had been troubled by the low water pressure for three years.Some of them were eager to sell off their houses due to the disappointment.The neighbourhood’s Neighbourhood Residential Community chairman Zihan Jaafar, 40, was reported as saying that residents had lodged multiple reports to relevant authorities but the issue was not solved.He said the issue worsened after several new housing phases in the area were developed over the last three years.\n",

      "SMALL businesses in Johor are racing to do online promotions and secure last-minute orders in time for Fathers Day tomorrow.Hearing and speech-impaired baker Nur Azureen Hussin, 29, said orders for cakes to mark Fathers Day were slow compared to Mothers Day last month.Using sign language, she shared that while business had not beenas brisk for the special day, orders for South Korean boy band BTS-themed cakes were good after she posted a photo of the treat on Facebook.“I use social media to promote my business, including FathersDay six-inch cake designs that come in chocolate or pandan flavour, ” she said, adding that all Fathers Day orders came with free cheese tarts.“I was touched when the Tunku Mahkota Johor’s wife Che’ Puan Besar Khaleeda Bustamam, shared a post on my baking business with her Instagram followers, ” Nur Azreen said at her Kak Ngah Bakery and Cafe in Taman Sri Stulang, Johor Baru.Nur Azureen previously ran her bakery business from a lot at the Larkin Sentral bus terminal.She opened her current place last month.“I and six others who have similar disabilities bake breads, cakes and other desserts.“I hope to continue providing my staff room to pursue their passion and show others that the disabled can be successful too, ” said the Sabah native.It is for this reason that Nur Azureen also engaged the services of her peers in the hearing and speech-impaired community to deliver the orders, although she also has walk-in customers.Nur Azureen hopes that business will pick up once the Covid-19 situation improves.Meanwhile, 21-year-old florist and gift shop operator Wong Kee Fang from Taman Sembrong, Yong Peng said she received a handful of Fathers Day orders from different parts of Johor.Since starting the business with her partner Catherine Lee Jia Jin, 21, in August, the duo have been relying on social media to promote their products and take orders.“The orders we received were mostly from those who are unable to return home for Fathers Day due to the lockdown, so they wanted to surprise their dads with a gift.“We came up with some special packages, such as hampers that include fresh fruits, for a healthy boost.“We also designed various fresh flower and beer hampers, which have been a hit with customers who plan to make it a fun celebration at home.“Our best-seller is the premium fruit hamper, which includes nine types of imported fruits and a canned drink of the customer’s choice, ” Wong said, adding that personalised greeting cards were also provided.According to her, Mothers Day sales last month had also been good as orders of their soap flower bouquets had come from all over the country.\n",

      "RESIDENTS who faced the enhanced movement control order (MCO) in Pekan Bayan Lepas, Penang, are thankful that the two-week strict order has ended, but some are now worried if they are still employed.Lorry driver Tan Lye Tatt, 45, who transports sand to development sites, is unsure whether he still has the job because his employer has not told him yet.“I am happy that the enhanced MCO has ended. At least it gives us freedom to move now as it was like ‘house arrest’, being cooped up in our apartment unit in Bayu Nyaman.“My wife and mother are also glad that the restriction has ended, but now I have to go out and look for a job and besides driving a lorry, I am not familiar with other types of jobs,” he said yesterday.Tan hopes his boss will recall him because his savings are nearly depleted.Food delivery rider Karthik Manuvel, 19, said he lost several hundred ringgit in income during the strict lockdown.“It was tough. My brother and I take care of all the expenses at home and my brother, who works in a logistics company, might also have a pay cut for the two weeks of staying home,” said Karthik, who lives with his parents who are daily wage operators in a factory.During the enhanced MCO, Karthik said his family did not dare leave the house after knowing about the high number of cases in their neighbourhood.Ridhuan Mohd Mydin, a storekeeper, had his spirits high even though his company terminated his services and he now has to look for a new job.“I only joined the company for two days when the lockdown was imposed on June 4. My boss said they could not keep me as business was slow.“Anyway, the restriction is lifted and I can go out to look for a job,” added Ridhuan, 28, who lives with his parents and sister in Bayu Tiara Apartment.Petty trader Mohd Aswad Jaafar, 38, observed that residents in the enhanced MCO zone were cooperative in following the standard operating procedure (SOP).“We knew what we were getting into and the only way to stay safe was to stay home,” he added.Mohd Aswad expressed gratitude for the aid given by the state and non-governmental organisations during the period, adding that many of the residents there are in the B40 group.Balik Pulau MP Wan Muhammad Bakthiar Wan Chik estimated that more than RM100,000 worth of food and household essentials were distributed in the area over the last two weeks.“At least 2,400 packs of food items were given to the people and their cooperation in heeding to the SOP was crucial in stopping the spread of coronavirus in their neighbourhood,” he said.The enhanced MCO was imposed on Sri Bayu, Bayu Tiara, Bayu Nyaman, Halaman Murni, Bayan Permai, Bayan Tiara, Taman Ara Indah, Kampung Bukit, Kampung Perlis, Kampung Masjid, Jalan Mahkamah, Kampung Pak Lah and Lebuh Kampung Bukit.It affected over 10,000 residents.The decision to impose the enhanced MCO came after health authorities recorded 83 new cases within two weeks with the total number of positive cases exceeding 250.The Health Ministry in a statement said the enhanced MCO was lifted at 11.59am yesterday at all 13 localities upon completion of the 14-day strict rule.The ministry said it had completed 3,582 Covid-19 screenings in the area and confirmed that the number of cases had reduced, new clusters were under control and those who were infected had received treatment.\n",

      "THE food court on the upper floor of the central market in Sibu is one of those most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The numerous closures of the market since February this year has left a greater adverse impact on the food court than the wet and dry markets on the ground floor.Food stall operator, Lai Lee Siew, 52, lamented on the situation.“We had no income when the market was closed. Although we are now allowed to operate, it is still very hard for our business to survive as people don’t want to take the trouble to come upstairs just to tapau (buy takeaway) food and drinks from us,” he said.Lai said most of the operators preferred to just stay at home rather than waste their time opening their stalls because business was poor.“Of the more than 100 stalls, on average there are only 10 stalls still operating.“And those who are still open for business find it very hard to pull in customers as it looks like people are deserting our food court,” he said.Illustrating how bad the situation was, he cited a drink stall operator who said that he could hardly make RM10 a day.“We are only allowed to operate on alternate days these past few weeks.“As I had a heart operation recently, I chose to take the time to recuperate rather than open my stall as there is no point since business is bad,” said Lai.Life for petty traders like him has been tough since the outbreak of the pandemic.“We used to enjoy brisk business.“I can only hope that the situation gets back to normal because we don’t know if we can survive more difficult times if the situation prolongs,” he added.\n",

      "DELIVERING packages, parcels and foodstuff directly to the units of residents in high-rise buildings is against the Covid-19 standard operating procedure.Instead, such items must be dropped off at an area designated by the building management for self-pickup.Delivery personnel had been found bringing items straight to the recipients without knowing that they were breaking the rule, said Housing and Local Government Ministry strata management division enforcement unit head Insp Mohammad Izzat Hassan.“Courier service personnel are not allowed to go up to apartment units in stratified residential buildings to make deliveries.“Some management of such buildings in Subang Jaya have allowed delivery riders and courier service personnel to go up to the specific unit to make the delivery, which is against the SOP,” he said, adding that this practice was not only a health risk but also a threat to the residents’ security.Insp Mohammad Izzat said people’s movement had to be controlled to curb the spread of the virus, while being vigilant with regard to criminal activities.“The security guards may not know if the person claiming to make a delivery is being truthful, or a criminal in disguise,” he said.He was speaking with reporters after heading a team to check on SOP compliance at a residential high-rise in Petaling Jaya. The group was accompanied by Petaling Jaya City Council’s (MBPJ) Commissioner of Building (COB) unit.The enforcement team has been collaborating with local authorities to conduct random checks on high-rise properties since the start of the lockdown on June 1 to ensure SOP compliance.Insp Mohammad Izzat said that although building management offices might have the approval letter to function as an essential service, the police and local authorities would still go to the ground to check on compliance.On adherence to SOP at high-rise residences, he said it was generally good but there was confusion over how delivery and courier services could operate within such premises.Insp Mohammad Izzat said no compounds for SOP violations were given so far at stratified buildings, specifically because the violations were due to confusion.“Other aspects such as no physical meetings, closing of public areas such as gymnasium and swimming pool were adhered to at all the properties we checked to date.“However, some compounds were issued to the management for general SOP violation, namely for allowing visitors and employees in without scanning the MySejahtera app,” he said, adding that the number of compounds issued were not available yet.MBPJ COB director Jayanthi Kupusamy said they had identified 10 stratified residential buildings to be included in the first phase of random SOP-compliance checks.She said there were 1,264 stratified residential schemes in Petaling Jaya managed by developers, joint management bodies, management committees or management agents, under the city council’s purview.“We are checking two aspects, which are general SOP compliance such as the use of face mask and observing physical distancing, and stratified building SOP compliance which entails providing the tools for temperature checks, registration of visitors and the MySejahtera QR code.“We are also checking their operations approval letter and if they have correctly registered all their employees.“There are instances where names of residents were included in the list, which is not allowed.“I hope the exercise will increase awareness and serve as a lesson to other stratified management schemes to abide by the SOP and help the country flatten the Covid-19 infection curve,” she said.\n",

It is accessible from the New Klang Valley Expressway via the Setia Alam interchange, which provides direct access to Setia City.For more information on SCCC, visit https://spsetia.com/en-us/venues/setiacitycc/homeAs for Penang, SSA at Bayan Lepas has multiple access points and provides some 2,300 parking bays.

      "THE mass testing programme to pick and test 1,000 individuals at each state constituency in Penang is expected to begin on July 1 after the method is finalised.State local government committee chairman Jagdeep Singh Deo said the mass testing will be carried out across 40 state constituencies where 1,000 people from each constituency will be picked for the testing.The programme involves the stages of registration, testing operations and post testing.“One of our moves under the programme is prioritising testing at hotspot areas.“The state Health Department suggested that we prioritise the hotspot areas so we will consider redeploying numbers from constituencies with no hotspot areas to areas that do.“This is to identify, isolate and control the Covid-19 pandemic in the state,” he said during a press conference at Komtar yesterday.Besides prioritising hotspot areas, they will also focus on testing people who are at risk, especially within hotspots areas.“There are eight categories for individuals at risk who will be eligible for testing.”One of the categories includes individuals at risk like senior citizens, pregnant women and children.The other categories are transport provider workers, essentials and services providers, hawkers and traders, those registered with MySejahtera, those living in hotspot areas, heads of families who live within target clusters and individuals registered as food or goods deliverers.“Besides the categories mentioned, individuals suggested to be tested in each state constituency will also be given priority.“At this stage, the testing method is being finalised and the State Secretary’s office is in the appointment process of deciding who to conduct the programme.“We hope to finalise everything by the end of this month and hopefully we can begin testing on July 1.“Then, depending on capacity and logistics, we hope to complete the entire programme in between 30 and 40 days.”Jagdeep said the testing programme is crucial as a preventive measure while the state continues vaccinations.“Right now, the state is taking steps to ensure more vaccination centres are set up as we aim to vaccinate 20,000 people a day.“We are always ready to expedite the vaccination process. But many have not registered for the vaccines yet.“In Penang, we need 80% of the population to be vaccinated, that is 1.34 million people out of the 1.8 million population.“For now, we have some 900,000 who registered so we hope another 400,000 people will come forth and register for vaccination,” he added.Meanwhile, on housing matters, Jagdeep said the state is committed to ensuring that the housing sector continues to move.“It is important to assist the housing chain as many people are involved when we approve projects.”He said up to yesterday, the state approved 283 applications involving 473 various works to be carried out under the state’s Housing Maintenance Maximum 80% Fund.“A total of RM45.2mil was spent here where most of the projects involved were lift and water tank upgrades and replacements.“Other works included upgrading or replacement works involving roofs, tar roads, walls, railings, piping and repainting works.”He added that up to June 16, the state spent a total of RM276mil on repair and maintenance projects involving public and private housing schemes in the state.\n",

      "STRESS and problems in coping with the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a 52% increase in people, mostly within the Klang Valley, calling the Befrienders Kuala Lumpur hotline for help.Majority of the callers comprise youths and teenagers.This was based on a study by a private university, which revealed that almost 75% of people aged below 40 were experiencing moderate stress levels.“This is not a good sign,” said Monash University Malaysia’s psychology department senior lecturer Dr Rachel Ting Sing Kiat.She said 258 people in Selangor took part in the “Covid-19 Psychological Stress Survey”, which was conducted between March and June last year.Dr Ting said the situation, however, had not improved this year as people were still affected by the pandemic.She revealed that senior citizens were better at coping during the pandemic, unlike the younger generation.“In the Klang Valley, teenagers and young adults are stressed because they cannot socialise like before.“We have secondary school students who are experiencing social phobias too, where they suffer from anxiety in returning to school,” she told StarMetro.She opined that students were not coping well with their studies due to the lack of student-teacher engagement.“Some tell me they are unsure if they are on the right track and if their teachers even received their homework through online lessons.“Online interaction is not the same as face-to-face, and because of this the younger ones feel stressed,” said Dr Ting, who is a licensed psychologist in the US.She said many young adults were suffering from relationship issues.“Loneliness has crept in among single parents and single people throughout the pandemic.“They cannot go dating or socialise, and many of them live alone in the city while their families are in their hometowns,” she pointed out.Meanwhile, people who have lost their jobs are facing financial stress, she said.“As for wealthy people, their investments have shrunk and this too adds to their stress levels,” she added.Dr Ting has created a non-profit support group on Facebook called Safe Space Covid-19 Malaysia, which has qualified volunteers who carry out activities for people in four categories, namely frontliners, Covid-19 patients, family of Covid-19 patients and people who have lost their loved ones to Covid-19.The group has over 100 members and 100 volunteers.“We verify the members’ identity and it is a closed group. The volunteers are those who have undergone psychological skills training,” said Dr Ting.She said the group organised live sessions online for them to chat, aside from online festival gatherings.“We do not conduct therapy on this page. Instead, we provide a support platform,” she elaborated.She encourages people who are suffering from stress to seek counselling from the various free services, if they lack the financial means.She said counselling was necessary as it provided additional support for people during the pandemic.“Everyone needs a non-judgmental listening ear,” she noted.Meanwhile, MCA publicity bureau chairman Chan Quin Er revealed that there were more queries on how to proceed with divorce since the movement control order began last year, based on her experience as a lawyer.She said the pandemic had also resulted in many elderly people stuck at home alone as they were cut off from family members due to the inter-state travel ban.She emphasised that mental health issues were complex, and what Wanita MCA’s Legal Advisory and Women’s Aid Centre (Lawa) did was provide an outlet for those who needed help.Persatuan Kebajikan Maha Malaysia, in collaboration with Lawa, conducts free email interactions, online meetings and phone calls offering counselling services during the MCO.The association sees a worrying trend with the increase in calls for help over the past one year.Association president Sung Yeow Swee said 83 reports comprised domestic violence cases.He said the worst hit in Klang Valley were those who had lost their jobs, especially the middle and low-income groups.“The number of callers comprising women have increased by four times compared to the same month last year.“This is why it is important to go for counselling.“People who seek counselling from us are dealing with family matters involving spousal relationships, or dealing with children and money issues.“Most of the problems were due to miscommunication among family members,” said Sung.On the positive side, he said people were becoming more open to the idea of counselling.For details on counselling and legal aid, call Lawa at 03-2716 5943.Befrienders Kuala Lumpur chairman Justin Victor said a worrying trend now was of people who were falling into depression.“We understand when people who have clinical depression call us, but now we are seeing many other people suffering from depression.“The lockdown has affected even those with no mental health issues before, due to their inability to do simple things such as visit their loved ones,” noted Victor.He revealed that women were also more likely to call for help over the phone compared to men who preferred not to talk about their problems, and that there were more women with failed suicide attempts compared to men.“Some 80% of those with suicidal thoughts who call us end up feeling much better about their situation after talking it out.“In most cases, they just need someone to talk to,” he said.He added that it was important for people to identify the signs and start learning about stress and depression through reliable channels, such as Malaysian Mental Health Association.To reach Befrienders KL, call 03-7627 2929 or visit www.befrienders.org.my\n",

      "THE Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor (KLSCCCI) has donated medical equipment worth a total of RM502,000 to Sungai Buloh Hospital for treatment of Covid-19 patients.The contribution of two Centralised Monitoring System units and five intensive care unit beds was made in response to the surge in cases.Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (ACCCIM) president Tan Sri Ter Leong Yap said the rising death toll and overwhelmed healthcare system was of great concern to all.As part of the chambers’ ongoing efforts to curb the pandemic, the ACCCIM and its constituent members across the country are stepping forward to offer assistance in various ways.Last month, the ACCCIM donated 20 units of High Flow Nasal Cannula and three ventilators worth RM626,000 to Sungai Buloh Hospital and the Penang Health Department.This sum was jointly contributed by ACCCIM and a few of its leaders, namely Ter, Tan Sri Lee Oi Hian, Tan Sri Lim Kuang Sia and Dr Chia Song Kun.This is in addition to ACCCIM’s contribution towards the purchase of 33 ventilators for Sungai Buloh Hospital in the middle of May.Given the urgency of increasing vaccination coverage, the Terengganu Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry worked closely with Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin in mobilising resources for setting up an on-campus vaccination site, which is expected to administer 1,000 vaccine shots daily.Meanwhile, the Kelantan Chinese Chamber of Commerce plans to offer its hall space to be used as a vaccination centre.The ACCCIM has actively contributed towards helping to ramp up the country’s healthcare capacity through various Covid-19 funds since March last year.Besides that, a RM500,000 donation was made to the Malaysian Medical Association’s Sabah branch last October, an initiative in collaboration with the Sabah United Chinese Chambers of Commerce.While being part of the collective effort in fighting the pandemic, the ACCCIM hopes that the Federal Government will expedite the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme in anticipation of the large delivery of vaccine supply starting this month onwards.ACCCIM is of the view that the various phases of the movement control order have been critical in allowing the government and society to work together to keep the prevalence of infections at low and manageable levels.It also believes that mobilising and coordinating with businesses, industries and the private healthcare sector to source for more vaccines and fast-track the national vaccination programme is of the utmost importance.\n",

      "TWO weeks into the nationwide lockdown which began on June 1, Penangites appear to be staying home and adhering strictly to standard operating procedures (SOP) to flatten the Covid-19 curve.The latest checks by The Star found many main roads on Penang island were mostly free of traffic.There were noticeably more vacant parking lots in George Town, evidence that many were working from home.Only handfuls of shoppers were seen at supermarkets while several food delivery riders were spotted picking up their orders for customers staying at home.Karpal Singh Drive, which was usually packed with joggers, has gone quieter in the mornings.On June 2, the National Security Council updated the SOP and allowed only jogging and exercising alone in one’s own neighbourhood.The previous SOP allowed jogging and exercising alone within 10km from one’s home but authorities found people liked going to nearby scenic spots such as the Karpal Singh Drive promenade to run while enjoying the view of the sea.In other states, police fined joggers for driving to other locations for runs.Penang youth and sports committee chairman Soon Lip Chee said those who were issued compounds for SOP violation could appeal to the Health Ministry for a 50% reduction of the fine if payment was made within seven days.“The ministry will then decide on the appeal,” he said, adding that the public should exercise indoors for the time being.Meanwhile, there was the usual long line of cars waiting at the roadblock along Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway heading to Penang Bridge as cops checked every vehicle for the necessary documents before allowing motorists to travel between districts.Penang police chief Comm Datuk Sahabudin Abd Manan said the SOP compliance rate in the state had been 98% since the lockdown began.“A total of 668 compounds have been issued.“The common offences include not wearing face masks, not checking in with the MySejahtera app, gathering at crowded places and crossing states without permission.“I urge everyone to stay at home. Don’t go out unless it is absolutely necessary.“So far, we have carried out 107 spot checks in Penang.“We are determined to take action against individuals who disobey the SOP.“We have 650 personnel manning 46 roadblocks during the lockdown,” he said.\n",

      "Johor government has unveiled its third and largest economic stimulus package yet, worth RM241mil, to boost its Covid-19 pandemic management efforts and provide financial relief to the people.Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad said the main focus of the stimulus package was to allocate RM75mil to allow the state government to better test, trace and vaccinate the people against Covid-19 through the purchase of the Antigen Rapid Test Kit and targeted screening.He said a large chunk of the stimulus package totalling RM126.86mil was allocated to improving the people’s welfare and human capital across various sectors.“This includes a one-off RM500 financial assistance to micro-entrepreneurs such as petty traders and hawkers as well as canteen operators, barbers, school bus and van drivers, religious officials and low-income households who are listed in the National Poverty Data Bank system (eKasih).“In efforts to strengthen social security, we are also lending a helping hand to those in the creative industry, media practitioners, students in primary up to tertiary education and employees suffering from income or job loss due to the pandemic.“A total of RM9.5mil is allocated to help small and medium enterprises and RM1.74mil is channelled towards the tourism industry,” he added.In caring for the people’s mental well-being, Hasni said RM1mil had been allocated to the Darul Ta’zim Family Development Foundation (YPKDT) to conduct online counselling, psychology webinars and tests to benefit about 10,000 recipients.The state government will also provide food baskets as well as food and shopping vouchers to ensure that the needy do not go hungry, he said.He elaborated that the items would be distributed through the respective coordinating agencies such as district offices, Johor Corporation and the Sultan Ibrahim Foundation.In addition, he said RM661,000 derived from three months’ pay cut for the Mentri Besar and 10 executive councillors as well as civil servants and contributions from various government-linked companies would be channelled to Johor’s Disaster Relief Fund to fight the pandemic.“We will form a special committee to ensure that the Ihsan Johor 3.0 initiatives are implemented accordingly and to monitor the progress.“This committee will meet at least once every two weeks and update the people on its progress,” he said.\n",

      "JOHOR will benefit immensely if the government decides to revive the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project in the future.Johor South SME adviser Teh Kee Sin said although Singapore would no longer be part of the project after it was terminated on Jan 1, the high-speed rail link project connecting Kuala Lumpur to Johor Baru could still go ahead.He welcomed the statement by MyHSR Corp chairman Tan Sri Esa Mohamed in his Letter to the Editor in The Star on May 19 that HSR plans were still on track.Esa in the letter said “The HSR, as a project of the utmost national importance for Malaysia, is very much on track.”He said the government had a clear vision of the project’s direction as well as how to achieve it, and that ongoing studies on the latest iteration’s financial and economic viability were extremely promising so far.“The project has long been studied and discussed for more than 10 years. We all know the returns and economic benefits are not for overnight gain,’’ Teh told StarMetro.He said the revised HSR project would encompass almost 90% of the original 350km of tracks, with stations in Sepang, Putrajaya, Seremban, Melaka and three stations in Johor, namely Muar, Batu Pahat and Iskandar Puteri.“The project, if revised and implemented, will attract investors to Muar and Batu Pahat, hence bringing development to both towns in northern Johor.”He said Singapore-based manufacturers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) planning to relocate their operations, might choose Muar or Batu Pahat.Teh said although Singapore was no longer in the HSR project, the Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link, expected to be up and running by 2026, would improve connectivity and accessibility at the Johor Causeway.“Hopefully, the borders between Malaysia and Singapore will reopen quickly, once the Covid-19 infection curve is flattened, and cross-border activities return to normal as in pre-Covid-19 days,” he added.KGV International Property Consultants (M) Sdn Bhd director Samuel Tan said the viability of the domestic line (high-speed rail from Kuala Lumpur to Johor Baru) was in doubt due to perceived lack of passenger load.However, he acknowledged that there would be many downstream benefits from the project, with Johor standing to gain the most as it had three stations located along the track.“This will bring development to the Batu Pahat and Muar districts.“However, if the numbers cannot add up in terms of passenger load (due to lack of connection to Singapore), the project may end up as a white elephant and this must be avoided, more so under the current economic climate,” said Tan.He said, however, many were of the view that Singapore might link up with the domestic line to connect to the greater Trans-Asian Railway (TAR) network in the future.The TAR network, when initiated, would link Singapore through Malaysia to China via Indo-China countries.“Under such an arrangement, the HSR will take on a different profile. Its role as an economic multiplier cannot be underestimated,” said Tan.\n",

When you feel like you are not up to doing anything, that is okay.“Do whatever you are comfortable with doing as that makes it easier for you,” added Dr Chua.For details on the therapy sessions subsidy, visit https://forms.gle/HXNaBp1mQs7TYLYq6For help in dealing with domestic violence or any kind of abuse, call Talian Kasih on 15999, Women’s Aid Organisation (WAO) on 03-3000 8858 or All Women’s Action Society (Awam) on 03-7877 4221.\n",

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "AGENCY\n",
      "The Delta variant of the coronavirus, first identified in India, is a cause for global concern with studies showing it is more contagious and resistant to vaccines than other forms of Covid-19.But there is also evidence that vaccines retain important effectiveness against the Delta variant after two doses.Here is what we know about how variants respond to jabs.Fewer antibodies ...Several lab tests show that the Delta variant seems to have stronger resistance to vaccines than other variants do.A British study published in The Lancet medical journal early this month (June 2021) looked at levels of neutralising antibodies produced in vaccinated people exposed to the Delta, Alpha (first identified in Britain) and Beta (first identified in South Africa) variants.It found that antibody levels in people with two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot were six times lower in the presence of the Delta variant than in the presence of the original Covid-19 strain on which the vaccine was based.The Alpha and Beta variants also provoked lower responses, with 2.6 times fewer antibodies for Alpha and 4.9 times fewer for Beta.A French study from the Pasteur Institute concluded that neutralising antibodies produced by vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab are three to six times less effective against the Delta variant than against the Alpha variant.... but vaccines still workAlthough they represent an essential marker, the levels of antibodies measured in a lab are not enough to determine the efficacy of a vaccine.In particular, they do not take into account a second immune response in the form of killer T cells, which attack already-infected cells and not the virus itself.As a result, real-world observations are crucial to measuring vaccine effectiveness – and the first results are reassuring.According to data published on June 14 (2021) by Public Health England, vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford is as effective at preventing hospitalisation in the case of the Delta variant as it is in the case of the Alpha variant.Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab prevent 96% of hospitalisations due to the Delta variant, while AstraZeneca/Oxford prevents 92%, according to a study involving 14,000 people.Previous data released by British health authorities at the end of May (2021) come to similar conclusions for less serious forms of the illness.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 88% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 caused by the Delta variant two weeks after the second dose, while the jab is 93% effective for cases caused by the Alpha variant.AstraZeneca/Oxford shows efficacy of 60% against cases caused by the Delta variant and 66% in the case of Alpha.Scottish authorities published similar data on Monday (June 14, 2021) in The Lancet.The team behind the Sputnik V jab meanwhile tweeted on June 15 (2021) that theirs was \"more efficient against the Delta variant ... than any other vaccine that published results on this strain so far\".They did not publish results, but said the study by the Gamaleya Center, a Russian research institute, had been submitted for publication in an international peer-reviewed journal.One dose not enoughAmong the currently authorised vaccines (as of publication time), only the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is given in one dose instead of two, and not enough data exists to determine its effectiveness against the Delta variant.For the others, lab and real-world tests both conclude that one dose of any vaccine only gives limited protection against the Delta variant.\"After a single dose of Pfizer/BioNTech, 79% of people had a quantifiable neutralising antibody response against the original strain, but this fell to ... 32% for B.1.617.2 (Delta),\" says the lab study from June (2021).The Pasteur Institute found that a single dose of AstraZeneca/Oxford would have \"little to no efficacy\" against the Delta variant.Data from the British government confirms the tendency in real-world scenarios: both vaccines were 33% effective against symptomatic cases caused by the Delta variant three weeks after the first dose, compared to around 50% effectiveness against the Alpha variant.In Great Britain, where the Delta variant is now responsible for 96% of new cases, these findings pushed the government on June 14 (2021) to reduce the waiting period between doses from 12 weeks to eight for people over 40.In France, the wait has been reduced to three weeks from five for a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.The Pfizer/BioNTech jab does however offer very high (94%) protection against hospitalisation due to the Delta variant after one dose.Shots and physical distancingScientists agree that the best defence against the Delta variant is to get a full two-dose vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Top French scientist Jean-François Delfraissy says creating a \"block of vaccinated people\" will help keep the Delta variant from spreading throughout the population.A US study from June 10 (2021) points to the importance of vaccination to keeping the list of viral variants from growing.\"Increasing the proportion of the population immunised with current safe and effective authorised vaccines remains a key strategy to minimise the emergence of new variants and end the Covid-19 pandemic,\" it says.Antoine Flahault, who heads up the University of Geneva's Institute of Global Health in Switzerland, insists that it is still crucial to observe physical distancing, share infection information and observe restrictions when necessary to \"keep virus circulation low\".The more the virus circulates, he says, the more opportunity it has to mutate and generate new variations. – AFP

      "AGENCY\n",
      "Amid Chrissy Teigen's apology and exit from Netflix's Never Have I Ever and her Safely brand due to resurfaced tweets, she and husband John Legend have taken to Twitter, claiming that a publicised direct message exchange between Teigen and fashion designer Michael Costello is \"completely fake.\"On June 14, fashion designer and Project Runway alum Costello posted screenshots of an alleged conversation between Teigen and himself from 2014, in which Teigen accused him of being a racist due to a \"photoshopped comment.\"In the now-deleted screenshots, Teigen is shown as writing to Costello,\"Racist people like you deserve to suffer and die. You might as well be dead. Your career is over, just watch.\"However, a report from Insider points out that these DMs may not have been real. For one, there is no verified checkmark next to Teigen's name. Instagram introduced verification in 2014, and Teigen was verified in early 2015, meaning these screenshots were purportedly taken in 2014.But the blue and purple message design was not implemented until 2020, and the video chat icon at the top of the screen was not introduced until June 2018, according to the report, which a representative for Teigen corroborated. A representative for Costello did not immediately respond to Variety's request for comment.On Friday, Teigen released a statement on Twitter, writing,\"No idea what the f*** Michael Costello is doing. He just released a statement where he didn't at ALL acknowledge how fake the DMs were, & now claims to have emails that don't exist.\"\"Chrissy is completely surprised and disappointed by Michael Costello's recent attack, which includes fictional 'screenshots' from 2014 of supposed private messages that Chrissy did not send,\" the statement reads.\"In October 2014, she did post a comment on Mr. Costello's Instagram when he was publicly accused of making a racist remark. After he denied the accusation, and claimed it was based on a photoshopped comment, Chrissy deleted the comment, as was reported at the time.\"The statement went on to say that Teigen believed her relationship with Costello was \"cordial,\" referencing several online interactions they had over the years.\"Chrissy has acknowledged her past behaviour and the pain she has caused, but she will not stand for anyone spreading false accusations to further demean her name and reputation,\" the statement continues. \"Chrissy will continue to do the work she needs to do to be the best person she can be. She hopes Michael Costello can do the same.\"Legend also took to Twitter to defend Teigen, writing,\"Chrissy apologised for her public tweets, but after her apology, Mr. Costello fabricated a DM exchange between them. This exchange was made up, completely fake, never happened.\"Legend continued,\"I encourage everyone who breathlessly spread this lie to keep that same energy when they correct the record.\"On Friday, it was announced that Teigen would be \"stepping away\" from Safely, the cleaning brand she developed with Kris Jenner. An Instagram story posted to the brand's account reads: \"Chrissy will be stepping away from Safely to take much needed time to focus on herself and be with her family. We fully support her decision and are thankful for her contributions. The brand will continue to move forward and focus on our important mission of bringing high quality, hard-working cleaning products to all American households.\"Earlier this week, Teigen penned a lengthy apology regarding previous tweets targeted at model and reality TV personality Courtney Stodden.\"Not a day, not a single moment has passed where I haven't felt the crushing weight of regret for the things I've said in the past,\" she wrote in a Medium post on Monday. \"As you know, a bunch of my old awful (awful, awful) tweets resurfaced. I'm truly ashamed of them. As I look at them and understand the hurt they caused, I have to stop and wonder: How could I have done that?\"The post continues,\"I've apologized publicly to one person, but there are others – and more than just a few – who I need to say I'm sorry to. I'm in the process of privately reaching out to the people I insulted.\" – Reuters\n",

      "Taylor Swift's 2012 album Red is next in line in her series of album re-records.After much fan speculation, Swift announced on Friday that the re-recorded version of her fourth studio album, Red (Taylor's Version), will release on November 19.\"I've always said that the world is a different place for the heartbroken. It moves on a different axis, at a different speed. Time skips backwards and forwards fleetingly. The heartbroken might go through thousands of micro-emotions a day trying to figure out how to get through it without picking up the phone to hear that old familiar voice,\" Swift wrote in the post's caption.\"In the land of heartbreak, moments of strength, independence, and devil-may-care rebellion are intricately woven together with grief, paralyzing vulnerability and hopelessness. Imagining your future might always take you on a detour back to the past. And this is all to say, that the next album I'll be releasing is my version of Red.\"Back in April, Swift released Fearless (Taylor's Version), her first album do-over. In addition to re-recordings of the album's 19 tracks, Fearless (Taylor's Version) included her 2010 single Today Was a Fairytale and six from the vault songs, that were not included on the original album. These included You All Over Me with Maren Morris, Mr. Perfectly Fine, We Were Happy, That's When with Keith Urban, Don't You and Bye Bye Baby. Fearless (Taylor's Version) debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top 200, Top Album Sales and Country Albums chart, making it her third No. 1 album in less than a year.Swift first confirmed her intent to re-record her music in August 2019 on Good Morning America, after her Big Machine Label Group catalog was acquired in June 2019 by Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings. In November 2020, after her masters were sold once again to Shamrock Holdings, Swift penned a long post on Twitter, saying that she had started the process of re-recording her old music. – Reuters\n",

He added that he shot the video snippet for the highlight medley himself.“I really put a lot into this album – I even tried mixing, ” said the musician who co-authored all of the EP‘s tracks.“It may sound hard but it was rather fun. As I got to do what I’ve been wanting to do, it was enjoyable – no matter how tiring, ” he said.

      "Do you have any real-life, heart-warming stories to share with readers? E-mail them to lifestyle@thestar.com.my, with the subject \"Heart and Soul\". We’d love to hear from you. Keep your story within 900 words. We reserve the right to edit all submissions.It's been 19 months since I last flew back home to Malaysia.We sometimes take things for granted and often not realise how much the person beside us has done for us. And then one day, we find ourselves overwhelmed with memories of how much that person has influenced our lives.I lived with my parents for nearly 40 years till I got married and left for overseas three years ago. I didn’t give much thought about going far away because, as someone who is used to travelling, I believed that I could always visit them whenever I wanted to. In fact, in the first two years, I went back three times.Recently, while talking with my husband, I realised that I was speaking like Appa would. I started crying, overcome by emotion.The next day, on a call to Appa, I just burst out crying. I told him that he had taught me so much and that I was truly thankful for it. I apologised for the many times that I had hurt him. He went teary as well. We’ve had some clash of opinions and misunderstandings, mainly due to the generation gap of 45 years and how we viewed certain things a little differently. Nevertheless, the care was always there.Years ago, Appa and Amma drove me to a maktab in KL for my Diploma studies. Only upon reaching the college did we realise there were too many students staying in the student accommodation nearby. That was the first time I saw Appa in tears. So he and Amma spent one whole week staying in KL to look for a comfortable place for me to stay, and they found one.He always advised me to spend wisely and never take things for granted. I cultivated the habit of saving money since young. He always advised us to save for rainy days and that we shouldn’t resort to borrowing money from anyone. Once I started working, I started travelling, which he loved too. I still remember bringing back the US$300 he gave me for every trip I went on. I would refuse it every time but he’d insist that I keep it, in case of any emergency, but I’d travel within my budget. It was he who taught me to live within our means.Appa is also one who believes in not stressing out too much on anything. Years ago, it so happened that I had an SPM paper to sit for, the day after Deepavali. Seeing me cooped up in my room for hours engrossed in my revision, he came in and told me to put my books away and go watch a movie on TV. I still remember the movie Duet. He is a practical man. He wanted me to have a relaxed mind before the important day. He knew that when I set my mind to do something, I wouldn’t stop until I achieved it. He encouraged me to do what I love but also told me not to work too hard. Even now he tells me and my husband not to overwork and to have little breaks every now and then to avoid unnecessary stress.Since young, I had wanted to become an English language teacher like Appa, and he encouraged me to pursue it. He always told me to follow my passion and gave me the confidence I need to achieve it.Appa loves writing. Be it writing a letter or an opinion article for the newspaper, he did it with ease and flair. Naturally, I developed that passion, too. I may not be a great writer, but I learnt a lot from his style of writing. When we were younger, he’d often write certain grammar points on the whiteboard in our dining area and then call us, including Amma, and explain it to us. I then started writing. He was so proud of me whenever my articles got published.Another important life lesson that I learnt from him is to be kind and not disrespect people who are less fortunate. I often saw Appa talking in a friendly manner to the ones who did odd jobs in and around our home. He didn’t look down on them. In all the three schools I taught in, I had good rapport with the cleaners, gardeners and office boys and they were always nice to me.I also learnt not to get worked up when something beyond our control happens. He hardly blamed me or got angry over any wrong thing I did, let alone keep harping on it. In one incident, I was driving his car when a small lorry hit the passenger side of the car and the window was smashed. When I reached home and told him, the first thing he asked was if I was hurt. Only then did he step out to see the damage. I’m sure it broke his heart but he remained calm. He said it was an accident and even though I was careless in a way, he knew I that I’d be more careful next time.When we were younger, Appa brought home a dog whom we named Julie. Unfortunately, she passed away unexpectedly. As fate would have it, another dog came into our lives in 2000. We named her Julie too. I saw how Appa loved her. I had seen him feeding strays, even on his trips to India. And so, my love for dogs, especially the abandoned ones, kicked in. We rescued, fostered and rehomed many homeless dogs when I was in Malaysia, and all the dogs we’ve had are the ones we rescued.From him I learnt to be kind, not only to others but also to myself. Before leaving home three years ago, I told him not to worry about me as I’d always take care of myself and be happy, and this is because of all the confidence he had built in me over the years.I owe it to my Appa for how I view life and I’m so proud to be his daughter. Everything that I am today is because him and Amma, and I love them both beyond words.\n",

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "JULIA TAN LI YING\n",
      "My dad, John Tan, is my role model, my friend, my tutor, and one of the two important mentors in my life (the other being my mother). He is my ultimate \"Ninja Turtle\" – my hero. I’ve always looked up to him for advice and guidance whenever I hit a road bump.He has rules set at home and practises proper manners even when guests are not around, setting a good example for us children. Manners such as not lifting up our bowl to drink soup but to use a spoon, tidying up our beds once we wake up, washing our cups and dishes, using proper words when we speak, and so on.He constantly reminds us that he isn’t a strict father and that he is also learning to be a better person. He is fair and disciplines us accordingly because he believes that we should be instilled with good values and taught how to behave from a young age so that we do not embarrass ourselves, and be successful in the future. We have to cultivate proper manners and discipline, because my Ninja Turtle says it will help us grow up to become good people.From the day we were able to read, he gave each of us a personal piggy bank and taught us to make a habit of saving our remaining pocket money in it. He always emphasises the importance of saving money for a rainy day because no one has a clue what will happen in the future.ADVERTISINGMy dad, who is one of 11 siblings, lost his father – my paternal grandfather – when he was seven years old. I’ve never heard any complaints from him about how hard it was at that stage of his life. He stayed strong and always lent his siblings a helping hand whenever they needed it. The protective big brother instinct is always in him. I am very similar to him in this sense because I am the oldest sibling in my family. Seeing how he handles family issues, how he is the glue to the family, relatives and friends, has made my respect for him grow.He is the first person I hope to speak to, rant to or gossip to about my day or anything that I am too embarrassed to share with my mother or friends. We are even friends on social media and we share funny moments on TikTok. Sometimes, he would crack some jokes or look at some funny memes on Instagram and we would laugh at them together. He encourages me to type using proper English words. He too learns alongside me and shares words he learnt with us to help build our vocabulary.“Do what is right, not what you want.” My dad’s favourite motto. He drilled this into my mind ever since I was mature enough to differentiate between what is wrong and what is right. I can say that this motto has saved me from trouble many times. I remember once when I wanted to copy my friend’s homework and ended up not doing it because it struck my conscience of going against what I had been taught.Turns out, my friend had plagiarised from one website and the teacher immediately caught her and later gave her an earful on the plagiarism and the serious consequences that follow.I enjoy his sharing sessions of wisdom and life experiences. It helps us think and ensures that we do not do things that we may regret. His advice has somehow always worked out for me, one way or another.I am 14, I am blessed to have him in my life to mould and teach me. I will improve myself so that one day he will look at me with pride, and can proudly show off how successful his daughter has become. Thank you, dad.I would like to wish him and all the fathers in the world, a Happy Fathers Day. Also, to my favourite uncle, Father Albert Tan, who has long been away in the Philippines for church work, and whose birthday is coming: Happy Fathers Day and Happy Birthday! Stay safe and healthy.\n",

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "AGENCY\n",
      "Miwako Sakauchi stands in her studio and brushes spinning swirls on torn cardboard and drawing paper, using the five colours designated as symbols of the modern Olympiad.Titled Vortex, her paintings show the \"anger, fear, sense of contradiction and state violence” over the residents evicted and the trees felled so enormous Olympic stadiums could be built, Sakauchi said. \"I can’t think of it as a ‘festival of peace’ in this situation. It's totally nonsensical.\"The Japanese public mostly opposes holding the Tokyo Olympics next month during a pandemic, polls have shown, even though outward dissent such as protests has been small.One little-recognised outlet where people have expressed their frustration and fear over the Olympics has been art.T-shirts, drawings and other artwork have become a form of protest over the decision to hold the Games against medical advice and the public's opposition. Officials have responded in some cases by demanding the sometimes satiric art and merchandise be removed, and the artists say their freedoms are being curtailed.\"What I can do instead of going to protests is to use my expertise in art, ” said Sakauchi of her motivation to produce the paintings. She has never participated in street protests or incorporated political issues into her abstract paintings in the past, but the Tokyo Olympics have been a tipping point.The risk of infection from the virus may have prevented people from taking to the streets to express their frustration.Sakauchi created the paintings after she was contacted by a group of artists who organised an anti-Olympics art exhibit last summer. Her works were displayed in another exhibition in February.Kai Koyama, the main organiser of the exhibition, said it is his professional duty to protest, even though he knows many Japanese are hesitant to openly show their opinions.\"We’re artists. We wouldn’t exist if we didn't express ourselves, ” said Koyama, 45, in an interview. More than 20 artists have gathered for the project.Another artist who joined the anti-Olympic exhibition is Sachihiro Ochi, 52, a social worker and doctor in a clinic near Yokohama Stadium, which will host Olympic baseball and softball games. He says Tokyo and Yokohama, the nation's largest cities, have hardened their policies on the homeless because of the Olympics. Public spaces that were once open are now covered with coloured cones and obstacles, he said.Ochi has tried to illustrate that displacement, along with satirical motifs, in his paintings of the marathon and the national stadium.\"There are people who lost their jobs and housing during the pandemic,\" said Ochi.Some creators of anti-Olympics art say their freedom of expression has been cramped even though their feelings align with growing public disapproval of the games.Before the pandemic, designer Susumu Kikutake made parody anti-Olympics T-shirts because of bribery and plagiarism scandals surrounding the Tokyo event. Online comments were harsh and he only sold around 10 shirts a month.But amid a recent virus surge and rising public concerns, the owner of the P&M shirt shop in Tokyo says demand has boomed. Sales reached 100 shirts in April and 250 in May.Kikutake said the spike reflects public resentment against a prolonged state of emergency issued by the government.\"My kids’ sports events and school trips have been cancelled, and we have been forced to put up with it... but they say they can hold the Olympics, ” said Kikutake. \"It really irritates me that (the prime minister) does not explain why they are holding the Games, and he just keeps saying it will be ‘safe and secure’.”The Tokyo Games’ organising committee demanded Kikutake stop the production of the T-shirts over copyright concerns, he said. He started over with a new design that includes fewer Olympic rings and a misspelling of Tokyo as \"Okyo.”Similar attempts to satirise the Tokyo Olympics have been suppressed by the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, citing copyright infringement.The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan removed a parody drawing that uses the Tokyo Olympic logo combined with features of the coronavirus from their website after receiving a demand for withdrawal from the organising committee.Koyama, the art exhibit organiser, is planning a third anti-Olympics art event late next month, when the Olympic opening ceremony is slated to start.But galleries are wary of subversive exhibitions like his, the artist said. One that agreed to host the exhibit backtracked after far-right activists targeted the space with loudspeaker trucks demanding the cancellation of another exhibition they claimed was unpatriotic.\"Freedom of speech is about to be extinguished because of the Tokyo Olympics, ” said Koyama. ”We’re being suffocated.” – AP\n",

      "“One teh, two kopi-O, three kaya toast!” Tall Sook shouted from the front to his workers in the kitchen at the back of his coffee shop.Although short and hunched, Tall Sook had a loud voice. Everybody called him “Ah Tall”, which means hunched back. Always good-natured, he didn’t seem to mind. In an ironic twist of courtesy, my mother insisted that we address him as Tall Sook or Uncle Tall.Tall Sook was the boss of the Nam Wah kopitiam in Kampar, Perak. Strategically located at a busy junction, it enjoyed brisk business in the 1960s. It boasted its signature Hainanese roti kaya, dai bao (big dumpling) and Loh Mai Kai (steamed glutinous rice with chicken). There was also a popular noodle stall there.Before the war, like many Hainanese folks, Tall Sook used to work for a British family at the army base in Penang.Through the years, he had perfected the art of preparing kaya toast, poached eggs and morning coffee. His bread was roasted over charcoal until it had a nice golden crispy feel. His homemade kaya was finger-licking good. It simply melted in our mouths. The aroma of his kaya and toast would drift upstairs where we used to stay. It made us drool.Every morning, as early as 5am, the hungry tin-mine workers would arrive for their breakfast. The tin industry was booming in the 60s, with thousands of workers. They would be eating either dai bao or a double portion of Loh Mai Kai. They would also have takeaways of some of Tall Sook’s famous kaya toast. They ate fast and worked hard.As a small-time tin-miner, my grandfather would also frequent Nam Wah for his daily fix of coffee and kaya toast. On his days off, he would take me and my brother there for breakfast. As the coffee was too strong for us, he would order some tea to mix with it. After that, he would pour some of the mixture on a saucer for us to lap it up. This was long before “yin-yang” tea became popular.Whenever we were at the coffee shop, my brother and I would collect some empty cigarette boxes left behind by customers. The common brands were Abdulla 37 and Lucky Strike. We would use them as “lego” blocks to build houses and other playthings. Despite smoking Lucky Strike for decades, my grandfather had still not made his big strike yet.Happy straysThere were about 20 marble tables in Nam Wah coffee shop. Typically, a family of six or seven would squeeze around a marble table. There would be a tam thuong (chamber pot) under each table for customers to throw their cigarette butts and other waste.The good life in Nam Wah attracted many stray cats and dogs. The rats were big and fat, too. The fat cats and dogs would prefer the easy life of feasting under the table rather than chasing rats or robbers.There would be either a dog or a cat lying under each table. The cats' mewing and the dogs' wagging tails tugged at the children's heartstrings. The children would be busy feeding the animals while their parents were feeding them. So, everyone was busily and happily feasting together. It was an eye-opening show of transfer benefits and associated leakages.One regular customer of Nam Wah was a jovial and short man. He was only about 4ft (1.2m) tall. Everybody called him lo sai (which means boss in Cantonese). As a bookie, he would come around the shop during lunch hour. His endearing toothless grin helped him to win many customers.He would approach his customers by greeting them, “Lo sai\", to flatter them and win some business. In response, some customers would tease him by saying that he was the real lo sai. Cantonese is indeed a flowery language with many intonations. Depending on how you say it, lo sai could also mean old and small. It was an accurate description of his age and stature.One of his regular customers was my father, who said that he was one of the most successful bookies working for a big “bookie king” who lived at the top of Golden Dragon hill, a residential area for the wealthy.The accident“Bang!” There was a sickening sound of crashing metal. It was a serious accident between a motorcycle and a car at Nam Wah intersection. From my room window, I could see the motorcyclist lying motionless on the road in a big pool of blood. The front part of the car was also damaged.The motorcyclist was surrounded by a big crowd of curious on-lookers. They were busy jotting down the registration numbers of both vehicles involved in the accident. They were hoping that the numbers would come out in the lottery draw. I was disappointed that they seemed to show more concern for their lottery prize than the welfare of the injured motorcyclist. A while later, an ambulance finally arrived to take the him away.Surprisingly, the car’s registration number actually came out during the weekend’s lottery draw. Hundreds of the townsfolk were jumping with joy and expecting to receive their windfall soon.However, in the middle of the night, the “bookie king” quietly and hurriedly slipped out of the country. He simply couldn’t afford to pay the prize money to everybody.It is rumoured that he went into hiding in London, where he remains until today. His big bungalow in Kampar lies empty till today, a sad reminder of the glorious 60s and a hollow life as a bookie king.\n",

      "Chaewon of April countered bullying rumour from bandmate Lee Hyeonjoo, writing a long explanation on the website of the band’s fandom community.She said that she has thought long and hard but wanted to share in detail how Lee’s claims – that the members ostracised her – were not true.Lee had missed practices and training sessions even before the group made their debut, saying that she was ill, wrote Chaewon. She, being the oldest, said that she tried to look after her and they always stayed together, thinking they were real close.“But as soon as we debuted, my worries became reality, ” recalled Chaewon. On their way to get hair and makeup done before performing on television shortly after making their debut, Lee disappeared. She missed the dry run and camera rehearsal and returned just in time for the live performance, stated Chaewon.“April was a precious opportunity I couldn’t give up and Hyunjoo was a very dear friend, ” she said, adding that she had had enough and looked through whatever record she had. – The Korea Herald/Asia News Network\n",

      "Boiling, baking, airing out: The skills required to make sure you’re safe reusing an FFP2 face mask (equivalent to a KN95 or N95 mask) are more often seen in the kitchen.To be clear, anyone wondering whether these steps are really necessary before reusing a face mask, should know that pathogens you may have exhaled remain on the inside of your mask.Put the mask on again without doing anything, and you’re breathing them in.Also, your possibly infected hands touch the mask every time you take it on or off; from there, it can get in your eyes or nose.In short, it’s safer to kill bacteria and viruses before reuse.However, the question arises of how to maintain filter performance after disinfecting a face mask.Researchers in Germany have found three ways that are easy for the general public to disinfect their masks.The options are in the oven, in the air and in the cooking pot.The oven method has come under fire because it’s easy to mess up: If it’s too hot, the filter is damaged; too cold and viruses don’t die.Chemist Martin Kreyenschmidt opines that boiling your mask in a pot is the best method.Put the face mask in a tightly sealed bag meant for freezing or boiling, and put in the water for 10 minutes.“This is a very simple method where you can do little wrong.”An FFP2 mask can be boiled this way about three times at most.Before trying this method, be sure to read up on how to do it online first.The third method is air-drying: Hang the mask up with a hook and leave it to dry for a week.This can be done up to five times before the mask should no longer be used.Occupational safety expert Peter Paszkiewicz is sceptical of such reprocessing methods and belongs to those critical of the oven method.If you want to reuse a mask several times, he says, air-drying is best.“That’s what we recommend,” he says.Under no circumstances should the mask be stashed in a pocket or purse.“Then bacterial cultures develop quite superbly,” he says.Face masks should hang in the open – ideally, for several days in the sun.Indications such as “NR” or “R” on the masks are not relevant for everyday users, he says.NR means the masks should not be reused.But ”from an infectiological view, this has no relevance; it’s more related to occupational safety”, according to Paszkiewicz.Self-disinfecting masks are also available.Special materials in these masks deactivate viruses and bacteria within a certain amount of time, allowing you to reuse the mask safely afterwards.One solution uses positively-charged textile surfaces to destroy the negatively-charged bacteria and viruses.Researchers in Berlin have looked at these textiles and found that while the viruses will be deactivated, it takes a few hours.The SARS-CoV-2 virus particles are not neutralised straight away.From Kreyenschmidt’s point of view, such a product lulls consumers into a false sense of security, and it’s impossible to say realistically how quickly the protective ability will wear off.Before buying such a product, be sure to really study its certification and see what standards it meets – this will help prevent you from spending money on a face mask that’s, in the end, useless. – By Tom Nebe/dpa\n",

      "Hong Kong actress Cecilia Cheung has revealed that she is looking for someone who loves her but adds that she would not make it public when she starts a new relationship.Cheung, who turned 41 in May, made the comments while chatting with fellow Hong Kong actress Sheren Tang on Chinese variety show Life Is Beautiful 2, Chinese media reported on Thursday (June 17).Cheung, who was formerly married to singer-actor Nicholas Tse, poked fun at herself and said she is very picky when it comes to love. Her other half should not cling to her too much, she says, but it is also not ideal if he does not cling to her at all.Even if she gets into a new relationship, she said that she would not disclose this to the public, citing bad past experiences.\"I don't think I received lots of blessings when I shared about (my relationships) in the past,\" said the actress who recently appeared in Chinese reality show Sisters Who Make Waves 2.\"The more you share, the more they would find a way not to give their blessings.\"Tang, 55, agreed, saying: \"They can complicate matters out of nothing.\"Cheung added that she would keep mum even if it was discovered that she is dating.Cheung was married to Tse from 2006 to 2011, and they have two sons – Lucas, 13, and Quintus, 11.She has a third son, Marcus, two, and has never revealed the identity of his father.Besides the two actresses, Hong Kong veteran actor Paul Chun, 75, also appeared on the show. The trio discussed the lack of younger talent in the entertainment industry, with some male actors seeing themselves as idols instead.\"Being a star doesn't mean he is a good actor,\" said Chun.Agreeing, Tang said: \"People nowadays don't love acting enough, as what they love is being actors.\"Cheung and Tang later posted on social media photos of the three of them together. – The Straits Times/Asia News Network\n",

      "AGENCY\n",
      "After being closed for months, museums are facing a new threat from pests. The scale of the problem is such that one curator has launched a new card game to help colleagues identify pests that can endanger art collections.Since last spring, insects and rodents have been taking up residence in museums around the world. Most pests are attracted to dark, quiet places, making the empty galleries of these cultural venues an ideal environment for such unwanted visitors.The Getty Museum in Los Angeles took advantage of its months of closure to carry out an intensive moth control programme. It reportedly took more than 6, 000 hours to clean the institution's 55 galleries from top to bottom, according to the Los Angeles Times.ADVERTISINGAnd it certainly isn't alone. Britain's National Trust reports that insect numbers increased by 11% overall in 2020 at its heritage properties, compared to the previous year. That's why Helena Jaeschke, a conservation development officer with the South West Museum Development Programme, has decided to tackle the problem in an original way. She recently created a card game called Save The Museum! with the help of her daughter, who works as a board game designer.A fun way to help fight pestsInspired by the card game Top Trumps, Save The Museum! consists of cards each featuring the silhouette of an insect to identify. The cards also contain additional information about the pests, such as their size, preferred environment and the damage they can cause in a museum.\"You can flick through the cards to learn details about pests and possible treatments whilst having a coffee break, or else challenge each other with a game,\" Helena Jaeschke told The Art Newspaper.Save The Museum! card packs were distributed to the 140 museums and institutions participating in the South West Museum Development Programme's \"Pest Partners\" project. This initiative assists cultural venues with the recent increase in pest numbers, exacerbated by museum closures and staffing cuts caused by the pandemic.While Save The Museum! is primarily aimed at curators, Helena Jaeschke hopes that other employees will take an interest in the game to help museums get rid of these unwelcome visitors. - AFP\n",

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "AGENCY\n",
      "It's been a long time since anyone in Ireland has been able to enjoy a pint in a pub, which were forced to stay closed as the pandemic upended public life around the entire globe.But as pubs are now allowed to reopen, it doesn't mean the challenges are over: Ireland's pub industry now must figure out how to replace the people skills of staff who left the trade during the pandemic.Kevin Barden, whose family owns the traditional Irish music pub O'Donoghue's, says he has been lucky to welcome back 19 of his 20-strong team after 15 months of closure, and he hopes the final one will also return in the coming months.But many other venues have not been so fortunate, according to Barden, and are finding it hard to fill their rotas.Until very recently, O'Donoghue's, a pub where the Irish folk band the Dubliners made their name, did not have a customer cross its threshold since March last year, when the Covid-19 emergency forced the closure of bars across Ireland.While relaxations allowed some pubs to reopen for periods in the months since, many traditional venues in Dublin remained closed throughout.Pints of stout are now settling on O'Donoghue's bar once again. However, ongoing restrictions mean the pub's defining characteristic – live music – will have to wait until Ireland takes some further steps back to normality in the months ahead.\"We're nervous but excited,\" says Barden. \"It's been a long 15 months being closed. Coming into the pub and no one being here is just a weird experience.\"He says getting ready to reopen had been \"a big joy\" and \"having the staff back – it's been great seeing them again\".Like so many workers across Ireland, the staff received an income through government Covid-19 wage subsidy support.\"It's been tough for them and their families and they're chomping at the bit to get back,\" says Barden. \"We've 19 out of 20 coming back but I think we're definitely in the minority. Every pub in town seems to be looking for staff, whether it's floor staff or kitchen staff or bar staff. There's definitely been a drain on the industry.\"Barden says the large number of people leaving the trade is worrying.\"It is the experience that is going to take a long time to be replaced,\" he says. \"It's one thing just pouring a pint, but it's how you deal with people, it's that experience of bar life which is kind of irreplaceable.\"Three kilometres away, on the same side of the River Liffey, production of Guinness at the famous St James' Gate brewery has been ramped up by an extra five million pints a week to accommodate the pubs reopening.Through its Raising The Bar initiative, Guinness invested €14mil (RM70mil) in 5, 000 pubs across Ireland to help them with Covid-19 safety steps, including training for almost 22, 000 staff and help in constructing more than 1, 200 outdoor spaces.In recent weeks, Guinness quality control teams have called at 8, 000 pubs to clean more than 50, 000 beer lines.Grainne Wafer, Guinness' global brand director, says experience of reopenings in other international markets gives her confidence that the industry in Ireland will bounce back.\"It's fantastic to be at this point,\" she says.Wafer says research showing Guinness was the most talked-about beer on social media during the pandemic has also given her reason to be optimistic.\"That is an incredible feat because Guinness isn't the biggest beer brand in the world but it is the beer brand that people are most looking forward to getting back into pubs and having.\"Colin Green, a commercial director at Guinness, says consumer experiences would be crucial to the success of the sector's reopening. \"We know from data that people have a really high expectation of the pub or a restaurant in Ireland – they want a brilliant experience, they have missed it but they have probably set it up on a pedestal as the best experience ever,\" he says.\"The pubs have got to make it feel safe and friendly, the drinks have to be superb quality and the food – it's all about the consumer experience,\" he says. \"People have craved so much of that social reconnection that pubs will play a massive part in that going forward.\" – dpa\n",

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "AGENCY\n",
      "Dear Mayo Clinic: A friend of mine shared that she went for her annual mammogram last week. At the appointment, she was asked whether she had been vaccinated for Covid-19 and had experienced any changes in her breasts. I recently received my first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Although I feel fine, I’m wondering if there is a connection between being vaccinated for Covid-19 and increased risk for breast issues? I am due for my mammogram appointment in a few weeks.In some women, breast cancer can present with lymph nodes that are swollen under one arm.Some patients have reported developing swollen lymph nodes after a Covid-19 vaccination.This has raised questions about whether screening mammograms should be rescheduled due to concerns that this finding could be mistaken for a potential breast cancer diagnosis.Mayo Clinic’s recommendation is that women should not delay preventive screening.Regardless of whether or not you have been vaccinated for Covid-19, you should come in for your mammogram as scheduled.However, you should let your mammography technologist know that you’ve been vaccinated for Covid-19, as well as how many doses you’ve received and which arm it was administered in.This information will be helpful in understanding the mammogram images.In your specific situation, you may want to consider having your mammogram before your next vaccine dose.If that is not possible, make sure you communicate with the technologist about your vaccination status.Lymph nodes are part of your body’s germ-fighting immune system.Your lymph nodes, also called lymph glands, play a vital role in your body’s ability to fight off infections.They function as filters, trapping viruses and bacteria before they spread to other parts of the body.This is why swollen lymph nodes are common in many people when they are ill.Common areas where you might notice swollen lymph nodes include your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin.When someone receives a vaccine, the lymph system is activated.Swollen lymph nodes are a common and harmless reaction to many vaccines, including for Covid-19.They typically occur under the arm where the shot was given.The swelling is a sign that your body is responding to the vaccine.Depending on the amount of swelling, some people may notice that their lymph nodes are larger and tender or painful to the touch.The challenge is that when your healthcare team sees swollen lymph nodes on a mammogram, they will want to evaluate it further.With the reports of swollen lymph nodes related to Covid-19 vaccination, your healthcare team will want to be particularly vigilant and ensure that the swollen lymph nodes are related to the vaccine and not breast cancer.It is also important to note that swollen lymph nodes are not seen in every woman who has been vaccinated for Covid-19.Most patients do not show changes in lymph node size on mammography.For those patients who feel swollen lymph nodes in their underarm, the current standard would be to perform a mammogram and ultrasound of the area.If enlarged lymph nodes are seen on your mammogram, but you are asymptomatic, an ultrasound will likely be recommended for further evaluation.You may be asked to return for a repeat scan in three months.Covid-19 has put everyone on alert, but my advice to women in general is that if you cannot have your mammogram prior to being vaccinated, keep your appointment and inform the technologist about your vaccination.Encourage your family and friends to stay up to date with their preventive screenings too.I also tell my patients that any skin changes – swelling of the breast, new lumps or bumps, or nipple discharge – should be checked out.And that goes for both women and men as breast cancer can affect both sexes.Early detection of breast cancer saves lives, so for that reason, regardless of what’s happening in the world, it’s important to not delay your breast cancer screening.Patients with cancer are at an increased risk for developing severe Covid-19 and being vaccinated is one tool to help prevent infection.We are seeing guidelines that say women at any stage of breast cancer treatment should be vaccinated for Covid-19 if they’re able.I encourage all cancer patients to be vaccinated for Covid-19 when it is available.But regardless of whether you are vaccinated or not, it is still important to practice safe behaviours, including wearing a face mask in public, practising physical distancing and performing proper hand hygiene. – By Dr Kristin Robinson/Mayo Clinic News Network/Tribune News ServiceDr Kristin Robinson is a radiologist with Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. Information in this post was accurate at the time of its posting. Due to the fluid nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, scientific understanding, along with guidelines and recommendations, may have changed since the original publication date.\n",

      "For generations of children, British children's author Enid Blyton conjured up a cosy world of boarding schools, beaches and freedom from parents.But The Daily Telegraph reported recently that English Heritage, a charity that maintains historic buildings and commemorates famous residents, had updated its website to say her work has been criticised \"for its racism, xenophobia and lack of literary merit\".This prompted accusations in right-wing media that Blyton had fallen victim to \"cancel culture\", where people whose views are deemed unacceptable are ostracised and shamed on social media.\"Five get cancelled!\" wrote The Daily Express, referring to her Famous Five series of adventure novels.The update comes as the Black Lives Matter movement is prompting reexamination of popular culture including Disney films.Born in 1897, Blyton is known for her Famous Five and Secret Seven adventure novels as well books about \"Noddy\", a wooden boy who comes to life.In a statement, English Heritage said it updated its online entry on Blyton in July 2020 to include \"a reference to the fact that the author's work has been criticised for its racism\".It said that this was part of moves to \"provide a fuller picture of each person's life, including aspects that people may find troubling\".The charity put a blue commemorative plaque on Blyton's former house in Chessington, southwest of London, in 1997.The English Heritage website cites her story The Little Black Doll from 1966 where the doll's face is washed \"clean\" by rain. It also says that publishers Macmillan in 1960 refused to publish her story The Mystery That Never Was, citing a \"faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia\".An academic who has written about Blyton, David Buckingham, emeritus professor of communication and media studies at Loughborough University, said: \"I think there are bits of Enid Blyton, like the story... where a doll gets its face bleached, that aren't what you'd want to be reading to a child.\"\"In a way you can say it was symptomatic of her time but it doesn't completely get her off the hook.\"While Blyton enjoyed massive popularity with children, she was shunned by middle-class parents and the cultural establishment, he stressed.\"When she was in her prime in the 1950s, she was effectively banned by the BBC for being of poor quality, and that continued right through the 1960s and 70s.\"Enid Blyton died in 1968. - AFP\n",

      "Mounted against a wall in Datuk Dr Jacob Thomas’ office in Ara Damansara Medical Centre is a large display of awards and keepsakes he has collected from around the world.Each item tells a story. When asked which ones are the most memorable, the group medical advisor of Ramsay Sime Darby Health Care (RSDH) holds up a small pin which has “Vice President of the United States” engraved on it.“This was given to me by a member of the U.S. Secret Service from when former Vice President Al Gore visited Malaysia in 1998. We were near the helipad on the roof of Subang Jaya Medical Centre, which was the assigned hospital for his visit,” recalls Dr Jacob, who was at the time, the executive director of the hospital, and would later be appointed CEO.In the following years he would rise up the ranks, achieving many career milestones and receiving numerous accolades, his latest being his appointment as the Joint Commission International Board (JCI) chairman in January this year.The first Malaysian to hold this post, Dr Jacob has been a member of the board since 2014.Recognised as the gold standard in hospital accreditations, JCI is a division under The Joint Commission, said to be the world’s most trusted name in accreditation.JCI represents a worldwide consensus on quality patient care that reflects advanced healthcare practices and delivery trends that enable organisations to be high performers.From ensuring hospital machinery is working efficiently to performing checks on staff, JCI does a thorough survey of hospitals hoping to gain accreditation.“JCI is a body which checks all your credentials, ” explains Dr Jacob. “How do you make sure your patients are safe, how infection in the hospital is controlled, this was something which they started doing which got more and more popular.”“There are bodies who do this locally, for example Malaysian Society for Quality and Health which is a Malaysian accreditation body, among others.”“The role of JCI is to make sure patients are safe, that the hospital has good practices, when a patient complains, people attend to it, and make sure that your doctors are screened, that they are competent.”Surveys are conducted by three surveyors, who spend five days in the hospital, examining everything in every single department, from whether your X-ray machines are calibrated to whether your fire extinguishers are working.“They check on how safe your hospital is, they look at your sprinklers and in between rooms if there is a partition in the ceiling, a smoke barrier. Before I was on the board, I’ve seen the surveyors, a team made up of a doctor, a nurse and an engineer, carrying out their work. They’ll prop a ladder up and climb up to the ceiling and look to see what is happening inside, ” explains Dr Jacob.Being appointed chairman is an honour, says Dr Jacob.“To be part of this, not just for me, but for the country and the hospital. It’s a big honour, not everybody gets to be chosen for this.”“Many, many things so genuinely gave me satisfaction than when I get into something which brings attention to our region and to the country.”A lifetime in healthcareKeeping healthcare standards high is a passion of Dr Jacob’s, who has served in the armed forces, public and private healthcare for more than 40 years.Today, apart from his role in RSDH, he works closely with various NGOs and government agencies to promote Malaysian Healthcare both locally and internationally, and he is also a steering committee member of the National Key Economic Areas (NKEA) for Healthcare.Dr Jacob’s dream was to become an ENT specialist, and he was on track to pursue this ambition when life took an unexpected turn.“I always wanted to be a surgeon. I have two elder brothers, the eldest is an eye specialist, and my late second brother was an orthopaedic surgeon, he was the head of orthopaedics for the whole of Malaysia, who passed away just after he retired.”He was given a scholarship to work under a famous ENT surgeon in the United Kingdom and was all prepared to embark on this journey when a robbery in his home left him with severe injuries to his hand.“When my son was eight months old, five robbers broke in and as I tried to stop one from stabbing me, I caught hold of his knife, ” recalls Dr Jacob. “He pulled the knife away and left three of my fingers dangling.”Hand surgery restored movement in one finger, but to this day two remain stiff.“That’s how I had to give up my desire to become an ENT specialist, but when I look back now, I realise it’s God’s way of saying that that path was not for me, so I went this administrative route and I have no regrets.”Dr Jacob is passionate about helping others in any way he can, whether it’s by recommending doctors to friends and family or by lending a listening ear to troubled souls.“One thing that gives me satisfaction and joy is helping people. The staff are friendly with me and I greet everyone, whether you’re in housekeeping or a top surgeon, ” says Dr Jacob, who recounts an incident where he found a telephone operator crying because her husband had left her.“She had two small children and didn’t know what to do and had nobody to talk to, and I sat with her and we talked. When I saw her years later, she said she became strong after that and her two children had graduated, I was so happy to hear that, ” recalls Dr Jacob.“I’m a people person. Whatever I’ve done, whatever I’ve achieved, in the end if I can help somebody else or give advice, that gives me the most joy.”He attributes this quality to his parents, who never hesitated to help others in need, even though they themselves were not well-off.His father, an engineer, would always find time to talk to the labourers and gardeners who lived in the same neighbourhood, and would advise them on how to save money.“We came from a poor family, as a young boy I only had one pair of shoes and if they got soaked in the rain I would have to wash them and put them on the stove to dry. We didn’t have a phone in the house and I used to watch TV in the neighbours’ house, but I’m grateful to my parents for the example they were, and for giving us an education.”These are the values Dr Jacob and his wife, Datin Dr Indira Verghese, an eye specialist, have instilled in their two children.“This has rubbed off from us without even teaching them. They’ve watched us, how we treat those who need help, which is something I learned from my parents.”“For our children, we gave them an education, made sure they can stand on their own two feet, what more can you do?”The wall of memories in his office is something of a testament to the much-loved and respected figure many know him as.“My wife has seen all this and she told me, when you retire, please don’t bring any of this back home, ” he jokes.For one so committed to his work, it’s hard to imagine Dr Jacob retiring.On whether he plans to stop working in the near future, Dr Jacob quips “I’m scared to retire. The moment I retire, I’ll start rotting, ” he adds with a laugh.\n",

      "This Sunday, we celebrate our fathers and all the men in our lives who are dear and important.Though the pandemic has made this Father’s Day a subdued affair, make no mistake it is still a special family occasion.Books are great as a gift in our opinion, and we've picked out a list of recently released Malaysian reads for your consideration.From the outdoor dad and the old school storyteller type right to the design-savvy dad and history buff, there’s a book for every sort of father out there.FOR THE HISTORY BUFFDiary Of A French Missionary is a perfect book for WWII history enthusiasts who want to venture beyond regular combat stories in Malaya under the Japanese rule. This book is based on a handwritten diary, which was meticulously kept by French priest Father Marcel Rouhan, the director of the College General in Penang, during WWII.While most Allied citizens were evacuated before the Japanese forces invaded, the French missionaries remained behind as \"neutral\" subjects. Rouhan's diary, therefore, is an exceptional eyewitness account of survival during the Japanese occupation in Malaya.The diary has been translated, introduced, and annotated by Serge Jardin, a French author long domiciled in Malaysia.FOR THE MUSIC-LOVING POPSWe couldn't locate a recent book on local music that was noteworthy. Instead, we decided to go with a highly-inventive Malaysian rock album - released on vinyl - which is bound to delight record collector dads.Not all dads are into oldies. For a change, why not get him MonoloQue’s latest album Lagu Perang (Bunyi Gamelan Melayu di Abad ke 21)?A recent MonoloQue Instagram post described this album as \"an amelioration of traditional culture, language, and legacy.\" That might be accurate. This album is ambitious in forging a new narrative for the gamelan's use in a contemporary setting. The Orkes Gamelan Pahang Di Raja (and the ancient instruments) is as important to this recording as the pop star guests (Najwa to Aizat Amdan), but it is main man Loque who must be applauded for putting everything together.This double LP, which was 10 years in the making, comes in the form of a deluxe vinyl box set, making it a cool gift for adventurous ears.FOR THE OUTDOOR DADHitting the jungle trek and being near wildlife is definitely a no-no this lockdown season. But the late Stella Rajendran’s coffee-table book on Malaysian birds will definitely transport you to the wild outdoors.Stella, a beloved Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) member, photographer and artist, had beautifully captured the beauty of her winged subjects, basking among natural foliage in Malaysian Birds, A Glimpse.The book, published by MNS and edited by Allen Jeyarajasingam, features 197 selected bird species with 300 colour photographs, caught expertly by Stella's artistic eye. But this is not just a photography book.Scan the QR codes and find out more about the featured birds in the MyBIS (Malaysian Biodiversity Information System) bird database.Proceeds from the sale of this book will be channlled to Stella Rajendran Environmental Education Fund, which will help MNS to organise environmental education programmes for school children.FOR THE STORYTELLER DADLame jokes and age-old stories seem to be many fathers’ favourite pastime. Why not show your dad how it’s properly done with Tan Sri Vadaketh Chacko George’s Some Stories I Have Told And Some That I Haven’t .This 274-page book - which goes back to the dawn of Malaysia - contains 100 funny, witty and insightful stories the retired Court of Appeal judge and former lawyer has told all through his colourful (public) life.Famous figures on board include former Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, and the late Sultan of Perak Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah, who George befriended during their law student days in London in the 1950s.In all, these warm-hearted stories from George about friendship, family, life and work reminds readers that a good story should always be shared.FOR THE POP ART DADIf your dad is hip and slightly subversive, he might enjoy Banned in KL, Astro Boy Rides The Wave To Sky Kingdom On A Grasshopper: Malaysia In Fifteen Postcards.Here is something that is part history, part art project and full of curious fun. The visual impact is also most striking. From ice cream wrappers in the 1980s and 1990s underground gig poster to the Syair Ghayat Al-Muna in the 1900s and Raja Bomoh seen through art, readers can enjoy a different take on local history and national propaganda.Through the pages, Universiti Malaya Professor Dr Simon Soon, architectural researcher Lim Sheau Yun, and digital researcher Ong Kar Jin take readers on a unique throwback journey.Each historical image is printed on perforated pages that can be freed and used as postcards.FOR THE PHOTOGRAPHER DADGrabbing his trusted camera and roaming the streets for a photography walk may not be possible in this extended lockdown. So, why not get your father the next best thing?Penang At A Glance is a wonderful photobook commissioned by the George Town Festival to preserve the island state’s unique diversity.The photobook showcases both the familiar and the never-before-seen images of Penang captured by Govindarajoo Selvathurai, Oh Chin Eng, Sherwynd Rylan Kessler and Thum Chia Chieh.These photographers have beautifully recorded Penang’s fantastic landscapes, time-honoured traditions, vibrant festivals, homegrown arts and of course, the friendly people.FOR THE (LOCAL) HANTU-LOVING DADThe late Singaporean politician Othman Wok was a man of many talents. Did you know he was one of the pioneers of Bahasa Malaysia ghost stories and horror fiction in Singapore and Malaysia?As a young reporter for Utusan Melayu and Mustika magazine between 1952 and 1956, Othman made a name for himself as a \"cerita hantu\" specialist.His classic works are much coveted by book collectors now.The recently released A Mosque In The Jungle is good news for Othman's cult following. It assembles two dozen of the best stories from his three fiction collections in English: Malayan Horror (1991), The Disused Well (1995) and Unseen Occupants (2006). Curated by Singaporean award-winning poet/writer Ng Yi-Sheng, this book provides an entry point into Othman’s world of horror.Here’s the perfect treat for family late night tales.FOR THE INTERIOR DESIGNER DADIf you’re not a big fan of your dad’s interior designing skills demonstrated in this lockdown season, maybe Malaysia-based architect/writer Robert Powell’s Terrace Transformations In The Tropics is the Father’s Day gift you’re looking for.Complete with sectional drawings and stunning pictures by professional photographer Lin Ho, this book suggests innovative and cleverly inspired solutions to spruce up your Malaysian terrace house.From introducing nature into mid-terrace houses to bringing sunlight into the interior and naturally ventilating your home, your dad would be spoilt for choice with the 26 terrace houses shown in the book.\n",

      "My dog suffered a strange, worrying episode 2 weeks ago. His eyes started twitching wildly and his head drooped heavily to his left. It was also clear he was not quite conscious anymore and we drove him to the vet immediately.The diagnosis was a haemorrhagic stroke in his brain and there is not much that can be done apart from putting him on some medication. But at least, we seemed to have caught it in time and we have some treatment options for him, though he is not quite the same as his head is now permanently turned to his left, which oddly makes him look even more cute.As he is my top assistant when working and writing, the subject of strokes was worth investigating, as it was extremely disturbing to see one in action. My mother also suffered three strokes, two of which were very severe and the last one ended up finally causing her death.Types of strokesNot all strokes are the same, even though all strokes are effectively an attack event in the brain. There are three kinds of strokes:1) an ischaemic stroke is caused by some blockage (e.g. a blood clot) cutting off the blood supply to parts of the brain. This is the most common type of stroke.2) a haemorrhagic stroke is caused by a bleeding in or around the brain (e.g. when a blood vessel in the brain bursts or fails); and3) a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), also known as a mini-stroke. It is the same as a stroke, except that the symptoms last only for a short period of time because the blockage stopping blood getting to the brain is only temporary.Incidences of strokesEvery year around 800, 000 Americans suffer a stroke, and roughly 610, 000 of them are first-time occurrences. Also, approximately 160, 000 Americans die from stroke-related issues every year, which is roughly one in 20 deaths in the country.The risk of strokes for men in the USA roughly doubles every decade of age from age 55 or so, where the 10-year probability is 5.9%, increasing to 11% at age 65 to over 22% at age 80 or more. For women in the USA, the 10-year probability is 3% at age 55, rising to 7.2% at age 65 and then 23.9% at age 80 or more.The incidence of strokes in the USA is not typical of every country, but it does roughly match the statistics from many Westernised countries.Risk factorsThere are some unavoidable risk factors, such as age, gender, race, and a history of strokes in the family due to genetic factors. There may not be much one can do about such factors, but they may not be necessarily as dangerous as the avoidable lifestyle and dietary risk factors.And most of these avoidable risk factors are related to the diet, apart from smoking and physical inactivity. So, in no particular order of importance, the dietary-related risk factors are normally:• hypertension (high blood pressure)• heart disease• diabetes• cholesterol imbalance• obesityThe simple (and surprisingly often very difficult) solution for managing the above risk factors is to maintain a proper diet. That is because the dietary risk factors are related, in varying degrees.A diet which helps reduce obesity also reduces heart disease, hypertension, cholesterol imbalances and may also ameliorate diabetes. Similarly, a diet to cope with heart disease will also help with the other risk factors. Looking at it another way, changing dietary habits to tackle any risk factor which may be of concern has the free benefit of reducing the risk in the other factors.The optimal dietI think by now most people would be aware that a better diet for health in general is one that incorporates five (80-90 grams) portions of fruits and vegetables daily with sensible proportions of good fats, proteins, fibre-rich foods, and meal quantities. And by now, most people would also have encountered probably hundreds of dietary suggestions, a certain proportion of which would have arisen from sponsored campaigns by food marketeers.Therefore, I do not intend to offer advice, but instead review an interesting large-scale study into heart disease which curiously turned out to be one of the more intriguing studies into strokes.A curious studyThe 2013 ‘Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea’ (PREDIMED) study in Spain was the largest randomised controlled experiment examining the effects of a Mediterranean style diet ever conducted.All 7, 447 participants in the study were aged between 55 to 80 years and selected because they were at high risk of cardiovascular disease (due to smoking, being overweight, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia (cholesterol imbalance), or a family history of heart disease).The experiment was simple. One third of the participants were to have a Mediterranean diet supplemented with a litre of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) every week, one third were on a Mediterranean diet augmented with a mix of nuts (15 grams walnuts, 7.5 grams almonds and 7.5 grams hazelnuts), and the final third control group was put on a low-fat control diet.The study was stopped early because the results were too good.After only 4.8 years, both the EVOO group (30%) and the nuts group (28%) had an average of 29% lower risk of heart disease than the control group. The explanation for this effect was investigated in some depth and the best theory was that it was due to compounds called polyphenols in EVOO and nuts. It appears that polyphenols might protect the cardiovascular system by improving the endothelial function and enhancing the endothelial synthesis of nitric oxide produced by digestion of EVOO and nuts.Endothelial is the medical term related to the endothelium (the thin layer of cells that line the blood vessels, heart, and some body cavities), and nitric oxide promotes vascular dilation and protect blood vessels from damage due to platelets and cells circulating in blood.A meta-analysis against other studies (covering 101, 460 people and 38, 673 stroke survivors) to validate the PREDIMED findings also found a strong correlation, and this meta-analysis additionally found that consumption of EVOO reduced the risk of strokes by 27%, which was a bonus result.This close link between heart disease and strokes should not be unexpected; in short, what is good for cardiovascular conditions appears to be just as good for strokes, as mentioned earlier.Other more in-depth analysis of the PREDIMED data found that people who consistently ate red and processed meats and other forms of typical junk foods were 48% more likely to have a cardiovascular event and 47% more likely to die. But remember, the people in the study all already had existing heart conditions, and many are past middle age. From this, the implication is people should avoid junk food and certain meats if they currently have a heart condition.Although it is commonly perceived that fats are involved in strokes, there are curious anomalies in the stroke death rates in the world’s top fats consuming countries. For example, Belgium (95.0 grams), Germany (85.54 grams) and Malaysia (78.3 grams) are amongst the world’s top countries in daily fat consumption, but the rates of strokes are significantly different. Belgium has a stroke death rate of 7.94%, Germany 7.58% and yet Malaysia is 9.8%, over 2.3% higher than Belgium despite consuming almost 18% less fats.To be fair, some of the difference in Malaysia is probably due to poorer health care systems, but there is also persistent evidence that the types of fats make a significant difference. Trans-fats are now banned for home consumption in much of the Western world but are often still sold in many tropical countries due to their ability to tolerate higher storage temperatures. Also, countries consuming mainly olive oil such as France and Spain have significantly lower stroke deaths despite having roughly the same fat intake as Malaysia.Lifetime riskAn often-quoted paper called the Framingham Study in 2005 calculated the likely incidence of a stroke occurring within the lifespan of a US citizen. It turns out to be more than 1 chance in 6 for a middle-aged person, around the same for Alzheimer’s Disease. Interestingly, the study also estimated hypertension is the most significant factor determining the lifetime risk of getting a stroke. People with normal blood pressure had roughly half the risk of developing a stroke compared to people with high blood pressure (ie, >= 140/90 mm Hg).My dogAs I started writing this, my dog appeared to have suffered a TIA (mini-stroke) this evening. He is resting now but it was a sobering reminder about the tissue-thin fragility of health. Less than three weeks ago, he was bounding around in the woods. Now we are watching him anxiously as he sleeps fitfully.I do not know what the stroke risk factors are for dogs, but at least you should now have a better idea of what they are for people.The views expressed here are entirely the writer’s own.\n",

      "In 2020, the global wine industry suffered a double whammy. Production was up, but consumption was down and as a result, the average price of wines had fallen worldwide.It would be easy to blame the pandemic for these statistics, but 2020 was the third year in a row where wine consumption fell, and it fell by 2.8% globally. The closing down of hospitality venues such as bars and restaurants due to the pandemic obviously had an impact, as did the USA tariffs on EU wines. Importantly, the 17.4% fall in wine imports by China also accounted for a sizable chunk of the 2020 fall in global consumption as China is the world’s sixth largest wine importer.Sparkling, festive wines such as champagne were the hardest hit in 2020, down disproportionately 15% by volume as fewer people found reasons to celebrate during a pandemic.Against all that negative news, one curious spot was that French wine consumption was up 14% in 2020, possibly encouraged by the lockdowns where there were seemingly fewer things to enjoy except another bottle of wine. The quality of wines consumed was also higher as the French appeared to be paying more for their wine drinking at home.This may be because quality wines were selling for less; a normal bottle of Margaux would normally retail for over 25 Euro (RM126) but I was buying them for 15 Euro (RM75) during the wine festivals. As a result, my cellar is now reasonably well-stocked to cater for a large wedding party if that ever became a necessity.Legs or tears?One thing quite intriguing and enjoyable is watching the interaction of wine with a normal wine glass. A swirl of any wine with more than around 11% alcohol content in a wine glass invariably leads to a fascinating inverted crown of liquid in the glass which has “legs” or “tears” flowing back down into the wine at the bottom of the glass.By the way, it is important to note that this works only with wine glasses that have not been cleaned in a dishwasher using a rinse solution as many rinses add a thin layer of polymers inside the glass.Initially, one would assume this phenomenon is simply due to the wine settling back down after a swirl, but prolonged observations have confirmed that this is not the case. One reason is that the amount of liquid dripping back down the sides of the glass often continues unabated even after many minutes, hence it cannot be a gravity effect as more liquid falls back down into the wine than was displaced by the swirling of the glass. So, the question is: how does wine replenish itself up the sides of a vertical wine glass?This phenomenon is known as the Marangoni Effect, discovered by James Thomson in 1855 and explained by Carlo Marangoni about 10 years later. And if you enjoy a good drop of alcohol, the reason for this gravity-defying effect might endear you even more to wines and spirits.Typically, the Marangoni Effect leads to features such as the display of legs or tears in a mixture of liquids, or the movement of liquids in a closed system. These liquids first need to have some contrasting characteristics. In wines, the liquids involved are the combination of ethanol (the alcohol present in wines and spirits) and water. Ethanol has two important differences to water: (i) it has a lower surface tension than water, and (ii) it evaporates faster than water.The difference between the surface tension of ethanol and water creates something called a surface tension gradient. Surface tension is both a tensile and a contractile force on the surface of liquids – the higher the surface tension tensile force (i.e. the ability of a liquid to form a film), the stronger also is the contractile force of the liquid (i.e. the ability of the liquid film to pull away from an area of low surface tension).The simplest way to view the Marangoni Effect is via a dish of water where some finely-ground white pepper or nutmeg powder has been sprinkled on top. Touch the middle of the dish with a drop of washing-up liquid and the powder will shrink immediately to the edges of the dish. This is because the area around the washing-up liquid has a lowered surface tension; hence this drives the area of lowered surface tension to the area of higher surface tension due to the higher contractile force.Note that this effect will be observed only if the amount of washing-up liquid used is not too high or diluted inside the water in the dish. Otherwise, there will be no Marangoni Effect visible as then the surface tension would be diminished to some common reduced point. This is a relevant point to remember in the following explanation.Surface tension gradientThe surface tension gradient is the difference between the surface tensions of two liquids in the same mixture. In a wine bottle, this difference is not always apparent as the ethanol and water content is initially well mixed together, but the inherent surface tension gradient of wine is easily exposed by swirling it in a wine glass.So, finally, this is how wine develops legs or tears.Swirling the wine in a wine glass exposes the wine to two important factors: evaporation and a surface tension gradient. The evaporation of ethanol is enhanced by the swirling as it exposes a greater surface area to air. The means the concentration of alcohol is reduced in the film of wine exposed by the swirling of the glass.This increases the surface tension gradient significantly as there is now more water content in the film around the glass, instead of the original roughly balanced mixture of ethanol and water. That is because water evaporates slower than ethanol.The net effect of ethanol evaporation is to pull more wine up the sides of the wine glass as the initial tangential stress (or increased contractile force) caused by the reduction in alcohol is higher than the force of gravity. Initially, the surface tension gradient is relatively low as the ethanol is mixed in well with the water content.But when ethanol is evaporated faster than water, the surface tension gradient spikes up to the point it can surpass even the force of gravity. Hence more wine is pulled up from the bottom of the glass onto the sides.The volume of wine dragged up the glass accumulate and form bigger and bigger droplets. After a certain point in time, the weight and volume of these droplets are unable to resist gravity and hence they start to flow back down the glass. These are the legs or tears one can observe in wine glasses.So now one can understand why one cannot see legs or tears in a closed bottle of wine or spirits. There is not enough evaporation to reduce the ethanol content enough to develop the required tangential stress (or contractile force) to pull the bottle contents up the sides.Therefore, from the above, it should be obviously not true that larger legs or tears always mean there is more alcoholic content in a wine. That is because an important factor is evaporation. This means the impact of the Marangoni Effect in wines is heavily influenced by factors such as humidity and heat.However, where wines are compared in the same environment, then the alcohol content would be strongly correlated with the size of legs or tears observed. In such a case, a higher ethanol content will result in larger legs or tears.So, I hope one now can appreciate not only the taste but also the complexity and beauty of the physics and chemistry in a glass of wine.This is dedicated to Allan Cheah, a wine lover in KL who passed away from Covid-19 on 20 May 2021.The views expressed here are entirely the writer’s own.\n",

      "MALAYSIANS have high beef consumption per capita, which is no wonder then that quality plays an important role when it comes to choosing the best.In Malaysia, food safety and halal compliance are two important factors when it comes to beef purchasing among consumers.Australian agriculture counsellor Sanjay Boothalingam, who is attached to the Australian High Commission, said Australian red meat was highly sought after because of its quality and stringent adherence to halal compliance.“Australia has plenty of vast open spaces that are suited for red meat production and almost 70% of what is produced gets exported.“This also means that there is a good production system in place to suit different markets, including Malaysia,” he said during the True Aussie Beef Up webinar.The webinar was organised by the Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), the red meat industry’s research, development and marketing body.Sanjay added that Australian red meat, including beef and lamb, had a prominent global reputation as a supplier of clean, safe and natural products.Meanwhile, MLA Malaysia representative Rose Yong said that according to the MLA Global Consumer Tracker Malaysia 2020, Malaysia has comparatively high per capita beef consumption of about 7kg per person a year, against the average of 5.4kg in the region.She said Australia was the second largest beef supplier to Malaysia, with a market share of approximately 12%.It is also the biggest supplier of chilled beef, accounting for almost 90% of the country’s chilled beef imports.“Australian beef is the favourite meat for many Malaysian families, especially among those with middle to high-income, with 40% of affluent Malaysians indicating Australian beef would be the first choice for their next beef purchase,” Yong said during the session.In conjunction with the webinar, participants also enjoyed a luncheon delivered to their doorsteps, featuring True Aussie Beef and Lamb.True Aussie red meats are naturally rich in protein and low in sodium.It can be enjoyed in different meat cuts and in a variety of cooking styles.During the session, participants picked up tips on how to cook different cuts of beef during a virtual cooking demonstration by chef Victor Chow, while consultant dietitian Mary Easaw spoke on benefits of eating red meats.Customers of Aussie beef also stand a chance to win special prizes the next time they make a purchase with the Great Aussie Beef Escape contest.Those who buy Aussie beef at retail outlets or supermarkets may win True Aussie Beef toolkits and kitchen items such as air fryers, pans and knives.All they need to do is buy chilled Aussie beef, cook a steak or beef dish, take a photo and share it with three people.They must also submit the photo to MLA for judging.The contest takes place from mid-July to end-August and the details for it are being finalised.True Aussie beef is available at all major supermarkets and hypermarkets in Malaysia.For more information and suggested recipes, visit trueaussiebeefandlamb.my\n",

      "One of the seemingly routine things in life that the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdowns have totally transformed is grocery shopping.Buying food essentials was once a matter of popping into the nearest supermarket, wet market or sundry shop and getting whatever you needed. There were no time limits – self-imposed or otherwise – and everything could be purchased at leisure. You could even shop for fresh produce every day if you liked. But those halcyon days of unlimited grocery shopping freedom are temporarily on hold, as Malaysians come to grips with the reality of the pandemic.These days, in line with the current lockdown and high Covid-19 figures, locals have been advised to either buy their food essentials online or plan their grocery shopping trips well and stock up on food to last for a longer period of time, rather than risk unnecessary trips to the supermarket.Many people seem to have taken this advice to heart. Team manager Ezrin Nik Ismail for instance, only goes to the supermarket once a week now and buys all her seafood online.“I still prefer going to the supermarket, because for me, when I go to the store, I will be like ‘OMG, I need this!’ Sometimes on online platforms, I cannot think of what I need. So I go to the supermarket once a week early in the morning when it’s very quiet and buy a lot of things for the week, ” she says.While Ezrin now totally avoids wet markets, given the fears associated with the Covid-19 clusters that emerged from some markets last year, others still find that produce is freshest in wet markets.“I go to the wet market once a week around 6am because I can get very fresh meat and seafood and it’s not crowded, ” says stay-at-home mum Theresa Choo.Choo also buys other food essentials from her neighbourhood supermarket but is careful not to shop for too long.“If I go to the supermarket, I will go at times when I think the crowds won’t be there and even then, I do a very quick grocery run. It’s not like in the past when you can linger and wander along the aisles, now I have a list and just grab ingredients and dash home within 30 minutes!” says Choo.Stay-at-home-mum Valerie Michael meanwhile only goes to the supermarket every two weeks or so and plans all her meals based on what she has purchased.“I only have one freezer so I cannot stock up much, but I plan my meals after going to the supermarket. So I don’t cook a lot of food at every meal, I try and stretch all the ingredients. If I do cook more, I freeze the extra meals, so that if I run out of food, I have back-up meals in the freezer.“For emergencies, I also have a sundry shop in my condo where I can buy a small selection of veggies and other items, so I sometimes shop there to limit unnecessary visits to the supermarket, ” she says.Valerie combines this with online grocery sites, which she uses to buy milk for her children as well as spices and cooking sauces.Tuition teacher Amrawati Narayanan meanwhile typically stocks up on two weeks’ worth of groceries every time she goes to the supermarket. And even going to the supermarket is a carefully calculated affair these days.“I really try to avoid going out and doing physical shopping. Sometimes even when I need to go the supermarket, I drive past first to see if it is crowded. If I see that there are a lot of people inside, I won’t go in, ” she says.To combat running out of ingredients, Amrawati has come up with a unique barter system with a vegetable seller who happens to be the mother of one of her tuition students.“She sends fresh veggies to my home and I just counter the amount I owe her with the tuition payment, ” she says.On top of that, Amrawati and her immediate neighbour have developed a routine where they buy fresh food and other ingredients for each other when they do their individual supermarket runs.“I ask my neighbour if they anything and they do the same, so we buy food for each other. And what’s nice is we don’t even take money for these purchases, ” says Amrawati.Property developer Raymond Ng meanwhile has opted to limit his supermarket excursions as much as possible in a bid to preserve the health and safety of the occupants of his house, namely his octogenarian grandparents and two young kids.“I normally order chicken, pork and fish online once a week. When that is delivered, I sanitise everything first before storing it away. For vegetables, I buy a little extra as I have a few fridges. Then I plan what to cook for the week, working through leafy vegetables like spinach first before using up hardier vegetables like cabbage, ” he says.Ng is very adamant about curtailing trips to the supermarket during this period as he wants to set an example for everyone else in his family.“I don’t go out very often for grocery runs because I am responsible for the health and welfare of two elderly people and two young children. I take that responsibility very seriously.“Also I feel that I can’t tell everyone to stay at home if I am constantly going to the supermarket or wet market. I have to look after my family and this means staying at home as much as humanly possible, ” he says.\n",

      "ABIRAMI DURAI\n",
      "When the first edition of the movement control order (MCO) kicked off in March last year, millions of Malaysians were housebound for weeks on end with little external stimulation. Which is why – unsurprisingly – people turned to cooking and baking with a vengeance.Very quickly, home kitchens transformed into culinary havens, from whence all sorts of adventurous, innovative meals emerged. There were no limits to what the imagination could produce and a whole new breed of quarantine cooks were born out of that experience.But one year later, and two weeks into a brand new lockdown, there is a patina of anxiety and despondence in the air.Covid-19 figures have been soaring for a few weeks now and for most home cooks, there is no longer the thrill of producing all sorts of exotic new meals. In many ways, anxiety has killed both the inspiration and the need for adventurous cooking.Instead the focus has shifted very firmly towards healthy, comforting meals designed to boost immune systems and provide nutrition in spades.What’s cooking?During the first MCO, property developer Raymond Ng, 38, experimented a lot and even used exotic ingredients like hairy crabs and abalone in his meals. This time around, he is sticking to tried-and-tested comfort food, as his focus is on cooking hearty, healthy meals for his family so that everyone remains in good health throughout the pandemic.This is especially important to Ng as not only does he cook for his wife Denise Chong, 37, and two young kids, Rayanne Deanna Ng, 9, and Raydence Devean Ng, 5, he is also responsible for the daily meals of his octogenarian grandparents – Dato Ng Tiong Seng, 88, and Datin Chan Lai Har, 87, who live with him.“Nowadays people have less and less money, so it is not about eating wagyu beef or other luxury foods, I think it is about comfort food. So during these difficult times, my recipes are home-cooked, simple meals like marmite chicken, sweet and sour chicken and fried fish.“For my grandparents, it is even easier to cook for them as they like simple Chinese food like steamed fish and steamed chicken. But I like to satisfy the appetites of everyone at home, so even though I make simple food, sometimes I cook three totally different meals to please my grandparents, wife and kids, ” says Ng, laughing.Ng’s views are echoed by team manager Ezrin Nik Ismail, 38, who says she experimented a lot in the kitchen during the first MCO and was very, very adventurous with her daily meals.But given the sombreness associated with the current lockdown, she has switched focus and with the help of her trusted multi-functional kitchen appliance Thermomix, she now churns out healthy meals for her husband Mohd Izrin, 36, and two kids Mika Danial, 4, and Lana Mariya, 2.“Yeah, it is definitely about building up my family’s immunity. Now that I have a Thermomix, I make everything from scratch. My thinking has changed, I care about what goes into my family’s mouths – I care about how much oil is used in our everyday meals, and in that way, I try not to eat outside food anymore, ” she says.These days, Ezrin says her go-to meals are dishes like chicken rice, soups, pasta and pizza. She also bakes bread and healthy muffins and often gets her kids to help her with the daily cooking to alleviate their boredom, as they are completely housebound.“It’s definitely about comfort food and things that are very easy and simple to prepare. I also like involving the kids in activities like making pizza together, as this is a bonding exercise and my son loves pressing all the buttons on the Thermomix and adding ingredients into the machine, ” he says.Stay-at-home mum Valerie Michael, 38, is also a big believer in healthy, balanced meals and typically makes a variety of dishes that serve her family’s nutritional needs like Chinese-style spinach soup, Indian dhal and pasta dishes. Valerie also uses her air-fryer a lot these days to create healthy fried food for her two young children – Adithya Isaac, 5, and Aryan Micah, 2.“Oh yes, I use the air-fryer for everything from frying ikan bilis to frying fish, so that the kids get healthy fried meals, instead of the usual oil-coated fried fare, ” she says.For other home cooks, the first MCO last year provided the ideal opportunity to learn how to cook more dishes. While some of the more extravagant or unusual fare might have been relegated to one-hit wonders, many wholesome meals have become mainstays now that the current lockdown is in place.Saritha Devi Kirupalani, 36, for example is a lawyer with a hectic work schedule. Because she normally leads such a busy lifestyle, the first MCO actually gave her the chance to widen her cooking repertoire, and she used that time to learn how to make hearty, nutritious dishes like chicken curry and Thai green curry.Although this iteration of the lockdown has been less fruitful from a cooking perspective, Saritha has been able to turn to the recipes she discovered in the first MCO.“I was definitely cooking a lot more during the first MCO, I don’t think I even touched my laptop for an entire week. So that time, I learnt how to make dishes like chicken curry and rasam (Indian tamarind soup). But I think this time around, businesses have learnt how to run on a work-from-home basis, so for me, work is proceeding as normal so I don’t have that much time to focus on trying new things unfortunately, ” she says.Stay-at-home mum Theresa Choo, 66, is one of few home cooks who is churning out more international fare this MCO. But Choo’s goal is relatable: she wants to keep her pandemic-fatigued family happy and nourished, which is why she has been making global food with a healthy slant.“It’s been so long since we travelled anywhere, and the lockdown is another curb to travel, so every meal that I make is to pretend that we are overseas. I have made Japanese sushi, Mexican quesadillas and Thai tom yum during this period. I want to make meal times interesting, so it is something everyone in the family looks forward to during this tough period, ” she says.Choo says having well-balanced meals is important to her, and she puts a lot of effort into making sure her meals are tasty and healthy.“I know what goes into my food, because I am preparing it myself, so I don’t use too much oil and there is always plenty of fibre in every meal. Also my home-cooked meals are not too carb-heavy, because I find that when you order meals from eateries, it is always 80% carbs, ” she says.Fruits galoreNearly everyone I spoke to has made a huge effort to include more fruits in their daily diet, largely to ensure they are in optimal health during the pandemic.This is bolstered by the World Health Organization’s nutrition advice during the pandemic – part of which is to consume two cups of fruits (and 2 ½ cups of vegetables) every day as well as snacks made up of raw vegetables and fruits.So many concerned parents are making huge efforts to inculcate the habit of eating more fruits. Ezrin for example, blends fruits and freezes it into fruit popsicles for her children.Choo meanwhile has a daily dessert platter made up of an assortment of fruits. Saritha on the other hand, started consuming a lot of fruits weeks before her Covid-19 Astra Zeneca vaccination appointment and is now trying to covertly introduce a wider range of fruit into her four year-old daughter Rania Ravenesan’s diet.“I ate a lot of blueberries and other fruits before I got vaccinated and I think that is why I didn’t have any side effects after the jab. And for my daughter, I’ve always tried to ensure she gets her veggies even though she’s a fussy eater. And now I’m trying to get her to eat more fruits. She recently started eating strawberries, which I’m so happy about because before this, she would only eat grapes, ” says Saritha.Tuition teacher Amrawati Narayanan, 68, also takes great care to ensure that she and her daughter Rena Shan, 39, get lots of fruits in their daily diet now, especially as Rena hasn’t had her Covid-19 vaccination yet.“I already got my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine but Rena hasn’t, so I want to make sure we are both in good health during this lockdown. So we have a lot of fruits in our house and either consume it fresh or as a smoothie, ” she says.Ng has also taken to blending vegetables and fruits into smoothies for his children as he wants to boost their immune systems, given that they are too young to be vaccinated against Covid-19.“My children dislike vegetables and fruits, so now every day, my wife and I blend it with yoghurt and make it into smoothies for them to drink and they like it so much, they ask for more!“Before, we never really ate a lot of fruits. But these days, I watch the news every day for updates on Covid-19 cases and I am always biting my nails from the anxiety. So definitely, eating healthy is my priority right now, ” he says.Food deliveryAlthough most people are trying to cook healthy meals at home as much as possible, sometimes it really isn’t possible to do it every day, especially when work beckons or cooking simply becomes too tiresome.Ezrin for example, allows herself one meal delivery a week, although she tends to hand pick the businesses that focus on quality home-cooked meals that align with her own cooking style.“I still cook a lot but I try to support local businesses because I feel like I want to do my part to help them out. I prefer food made by home businesses in my area, as it is still nice and warm when it arrives, ” she says.Valerie believes that the growing number of people starting home food businesses has also resulted in a parallel number of consumers eager to support these smaller home-hewn establishments making quality meals.“During the pandemic, I have seen a lot of people – including friends of mine – start small businesses selling food, mostly because times are bad and people have had to take pay cuts or sustain job losses. So I think many people are supporting these businesses and it also gives everyone the opportunity to try something different.“Like for me, practically every weekend, I will order food from my sister who has a small business catering home-cooked meals on the weekends, ” she says.Saritha on the other hand, confesses that with her busy work schedule, she does often have to turn to food delivery services for help, especially on days when she doesn’t have the time to cook.“Oh yes, I turn to food delivery portals very, very often. But it also gets to a point where you are sick and tired of it, especially when you see the same food and the same restaurants listed over and over again, and sometimes that is what compels me to cook simple dishes.“Like the other day, I made a Maggi mee goreng with lots of vegetables and prawns, even though I didn’t have much time after work. And that was purely because I was tired of ordering outside food!” she says.For others, safety is so central to everything that they do that ordering meals is now verboten. Ng, for instance, actually co-owns a Japanese eatery and understands the need to support local businesses, but confesses that his desire to protect his family overrides his yearning for outside meals.“I am a restaurant owner too – my restaurant does delivery and takeaway, but for me, home-cooked food is my priority now because I don’t want to get in touch with unnecessary people coming to my house as my grandparents are at home and they are very vulnerable, so I need to take extra safety precautions, ” he says.\n",

      "Curious Cook: Eat your nitrate-rich veggies\n",

      "CHRIS CHAN\n",
      "This week, there are no hugely surprising news but confirmations of some old research which has been updated and generally validated. I also must confess that I have been busy with work so have not been able to allocate the usual number of hours to research into more esoteric subjects, but the following items should be comforting as there appear to be possible real-life human benefits according to some recent papers.Nitrate-rich vegetables really helpEveryone knows five portions of vegetables and fruit are helpful for maintaining good health. Lots of research have confirmed this. But one might be interested to know that a very recent paper confirmed that around 120 grams of nitrate-rich greens appear to have the most positive impact on heart health. The paper from New Edith Cowan University (ECU) is not new news as it mostly confirmed an earlier 2018 research paper funded by Isagenix International LLC. I had ignored the 2018 paper previously due to possible bias as the sponsors are a multi-level marketing company promoting and selling various dietary supplements.The latest study, ‘Vegetable nitrate intake, blood pressure and incident cardiovascular disease: Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study’, released on 4 May 2021 is much more plausible, even though it mostly echoed the 2018 paper. The basic summary is that people who consumed a daily minimum quantity of nitrate-rich vegetables had on average 2.5 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure and a 12% to 26% lower risk of heart disease. These findings were based on a study size of over 50, 000 people in Denmark conducted over 23 years.The main aim of the ECU study was identification of dietary factors which lead to lower incidences of heart disease. The primary finding was very simple: just a daily cup of raw (or half a cup of cooked) nitrate-rich vegetables was determined to have significant cardiovascular benefits. And consuming more than this daily amount (around 120 grams) did not accrue any additional benefits.How nitrate-rich vegetables help with cardiovascular health appeared to be linked with nitric oxide levels. Nitric oxide (NO) production is significantly stimulated through enzymatic-dependent mechanisms during the dietary intake of nitrate-containing foods. NO is a primary vasodilatory factor and it is absorbed from the endothelial cells of the peripheral vasculature where it is accumulated from the digestion of nitrate-rich foods.In summary, raised NO levels in the body arising from adequate consumption of nitrate-rich vegetables is linked to vasodilation, or the widening of the larger blood vessels such as arteries or veins. This factor contributed to a lower incidence of heart disease and reduced levels of hypertension (high blood pressure).NO was determined to be a signalling molecule in the cardiovascular system much earlier on and this discovery had led to a Nobel prize in 1998 for Robert Furchgott, Ferid Murad and Louis Ignarro. Confirmation of the dietary associations with NO were established later.Prior to this, the use of NO was more specific. For example, NO was introduced to cardiac patients via nitroglycerine to improve cardiovascular health, intensive care patients had NO gas included in oxygen ventilation systems to reduce dangerous high blood pressure levels, and NO had also been used to treat erectile dysfunction in men, among other interesting treatments.Another associated paper from ECU published just over a month earlier also indicates that a nitrate-rich vegetable diet improves muscle function in the lower limbs. The study was smaller, on 3, 759 Australians, conducted over 12 years but the findings were very interesting.The results from ‘Dietary Nitrate Intake Is Positively Associated with Muscle Function in Men and Women Independent of Physical Activity Levels’ indicated an 11% improvement in lower limb strength and a 4% faster walking speed for people who consumed higher amounts of nitrate-rich vegetables daily.What was remarkable was the improvements in lower limb strength appeared to occur primarily from the nitrate-rich diet, regardless of the amount of any additional physical activity.Nitrites versus nitratesAt this point, one should note the important difference between synthetic nitrites (and some synthetic nitrates) used as food preservatives (usually in meats) and natural nitrates found in green vegetables. Synthetic nitrites (and some synthetic nitrates) are commonly included in processed meats as preservatives.However, these synthetic nitrogen-based compounds break down into nitrosamines in the human digestive system and over 90% of nitrosamines are determined to be carcinogens of varying gravity. The World Health Organisation had therefore categorised processed meats as Group 1 carcinogens in 2015.If one finds that consumption of foods treated with nitrites is unavoidable, then include at least some other food items with high levels of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) with the meal. This helps prevent the conversion of nitrites in the stomach into nitrosamines.Plant foods with natural nitratesThe plants containing beneficial natural nitrates make up a long list, so it is normally never a huge problem to acquire the daily suggested quantity of nitrates. Some common examples are green, leafy vegetables (like spinach, mustard greens, arugula, kale, Swiss chard and lettuce), beetroot, radishes, turnips, watercress, Chinese greens (such as bok choi, Chinese cabbage, choi sum, etc), kohlrabi, chicory leaf, celery, onion, garlic, etc.Considering the small quantity of consumption of greens required, the health benefits appear to significantly outweigh the marginal costs and efforts involved, especially if one is susceptible to hypertension or some cardiovascular conditions.Chocolate as a (possible) treatment for liver diseasePossibly adding to the good news is a recent April 2021 study that suggested chocolate could be a beneficial treatment for fatty liver disease and inflammation, particularly various liver conditions not associated with alcohol-related damage.It has been claimed for many years that phytochemicals in chocolate such as polyphenols and methylxanthines have health benefits, including reduced risks of cardio-metabolic diseases including stroke, coronary heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, conditions common to obese humans. The impact of chocolate on obese mice was therefore the basis for the study.The study outcomes were remarkably positive. However, it was regrettable the Penn State paper, ‘Dietary cocoa ameliorates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and increases markers of antioxidant response and mitochondrial biogenesis in high fat-fed mice’ did not attempt to identify the compounds in chocolate which were claimed to promote the positive effects on the laboratory mice.Nevertheless, compared to obese mice in the control group which were also kept on excessive diets, the chocolate-treated mice exhibited extremely interesting outcomes after eight weeks, such as 28% lower liver fat levels, 56% lower levels of oxidative stress and 75% lower levels of DNA damage. Curiously, chocolate-treated mice also gained weight at a 21% slower rate.If the same outcomes from the mice experiments can be extrapolated to humans, the health benefits would obviously be immense. From a rational perspective however, the reality is more complicated, and there is currently no guarantee that such mice-related health improvements would apply to people, although the study is hopeful the positive results can translate to humans.The daily dosage of chocolate required was also challenging. In the absence of precise knowledge of the actual effective compounds in chocolate, humans would require about 10 tablespoons of low-sugar cocoa powder every day to match the amount of chocolate administered to the test mice. This large daily quantity of chocolate may be a factor in the results as ingesting so much chocolate might act as an appetite inhibitor, and there is no data offered about this possible suppressant effect.So, although the chocolate study might be good news to humans one day, until the actual active compounds in chocolate are identified, about the only thing one can presently suggest is that it may be an idea to substitute snacks without chocolate with snacks which contain chocolate. This is just a very informal suggestion, by the way, and not a recommendation.The views expressed are entirely the writer’s own\n",

      "CHINESE rice dumpling or zongzi, commonly known as chang among locals, has a long tradition steeped in history.Legend has it that poet and minister Qu Yuan, who served during the Zhou Dynasty, was wrongly accused of treason and committed suicide by drowning.The locals could not retrieve his body.Afraid that it would be devoured by river creatures, they threw rice dumplings into the river.From then on, the Dumpling Festival was held annually to remember him.The rice dumplings are wrapped in bamboo leaves and usually contain meat, nuts and beans.There are also vegetarian versions that may contain meat substitutes such as mushrooms, gluten or bean curd.Traditionally, the vegetarian option for chang is the alkaline dumpling or gan sui joong.Alkaline dumpling is so unique in texture and flavour that it is quite difficult to describe to anyone unfamiliar with it.The lye solution that is used to cure the rice, creates dumplings with a distinctive yellow colour, translucent appearance, springy texture and a subtly pungent flavour.There is an exact science in using lye solution, sometimes called lye water or alkali water.It is bottled locally as air abu soda and available at bakery supply shops.For 200g of rice, only half a tablespoon of lye is used.Any less may not be sufficient to cure the rice and any more may cause the rice to taste like soap.The red bean paste recipe is from my mother, who would melt the sugar in the oil to caramelise it before adding the red bean puree.This recipe makes a lot more paste than is needed for the dumplings, so the rest can be stored for mooncakes and steamed buns.I also use it to stuff glutinous rice balls for the winter solstice festival.Rice dumplings need to cool down completely for it to attain a glossy surface, allowing the wrappings to come off easily.Although it can be enjoyed on its own, some people like to serve it with a drizzle of palm sugar.Alkaline dumplings with red bean paste fillingIngredients200g glutinous rice½ tbsp lye solution20 bamboo leaves10 hemp stringsRed bean paste500g adzuki beans6 cups cold water1 cup cooking oil400g granulated sugarMethodFor the bean paste, wash the adzuki beans until water runs clear. If boiling over the stove, soak overnight, then simmer over medium heat for two hours until soft. Use immediately if boiling in a pressure cooker for 40 minutes.With a hand blender, puree red beans until they become a smooth paste. If using a regular blender, add sufficient water to form a smooth paste.Heat oil in a frying pan and add sugar to melt and caramelise in the oil. When sugar has turned a light golden brown, add pureed red beans and stir until the oil and caramel have combined into the red bean paste.Turn off heat and allow to cool completely before rolling out 10 balls of red bean paste about 2cm in diameter. Store excess bean paste in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a week or in the freezer for two months.Wash glutinous rice until water runs clear. Soak rice in cold water overnight or at least four hours. Then drain the rice in a colander or wire sieve and let it drip dry for 30 minutes.Finally, stir in lye solution and let it sit for 30 minutes but no more than two hours.Scrub the bamboo leaves and hemp strings with a brush to get rid of dust and dirt. Place leaves and strings in a pot with sufficient water to submerge and bring to a boil. Then set aside to soak in the water until needed.To assemble the dumplings, overlap two sheets of bamboo leaves and create a cone shape in the middle of the leaves. Fill the cone with one teaspoon of rice, stuff with a ball of red bean paste, then cover with another teaspoon of rice.Push the cone into a triangular shape and cover with the big flap of leaf until it forms a tetrahedron-shaped pyramid. Fold the excess flap against the side of the pyramid and tie firmly with a hemp string.When all the dumplings are properly wrapped, bring a big pot of water to a boil. Then submerge the dumplings in the water, cover with a lid and simmer over medium heat for an hour and 15 minutes.When cooked, remove dumplings from the pot and hang to drip off excess water. Cool completely, for at least an hour. Store at room temperature for no more than three days, or in the refrigerator for a week.\n",

      "Our perception of calorie content can be distorted by the temperature of a dish, whether warm or cold.This could lead us to eat more.According to a study from France, our brain perceives a cold dish to be lighter in calories than a warm dish.The majority of people who choose a cold dish tend to consume more calories (+31%), fat (+37%) and carbohydrates (+22%).But how can this unconscious decision made by our brain be explained?To answer this question, three researchers from Grenoble Ecole de Management conducted a survey of 2,600 French, American and Brazilian adults of all ages.One of the study’s authors, Amanda Pruski Yamim, offered a first element of explanation for this observation in a press release.“In most cultures, warm foods are considered filling and play an important role in the day’s main meals.“This perception comes from the fact that humans digest hot foods more easily and expect warm food to be tastier,” she outlines.And so for a tastier meal, we are willing to pay more.The study reports that survey participants would be willing to pay up to 25% more for a food item when it was served (or simply labelled) hot.“These observations are essential for people with weight problems or suffering from obesity,” says the researcher, who advises adding a warm food item to a cold dish to increase the feeling of satiety. – AFP RelaxnewsOrder hot and healthy food straight to your doorsteps at wallet friendly prices with foodpanda Promo Code\n",

      "PUDING raja or royal pudding gained popularity when the current King’s reign began in 2019.Naturally, it was the dessert served during His Majesty’s installation banquet at Istana Negara.This sweet treat comes from Pahang where it was originally served to the royal family at their palace in Pekan.The recipe was compiled by the Queen herself in her book titled Air Tangan Tengku Puan Pahang.The dish is traditionally served during Malay weddings and festivals as well as during Ramadan.The main ingredient is a small, sweet local banana called pisang lemak manis, but you may substitute it with pisang emas.Unlike many other fried banana recipes where the fruits are sliced first, this calls for the bananas to be fried whole. Be careful when lifting the bananas out of the oil because they get extremely soft and mushy when hot.The most time-consuming component of this dish is the jala emas or golden threads.Although these are available ready-made from many online vendors, you can determine the sweetness level and which egg to make it with if you make them yourself.It is recommended that you use the yolks of duck eggs but chicken egg yolks would work as well.The only difference is the richness in the flavour that you get from duck egg yolks.The other usual garnishes are prunes, crystallised cherries and cashew nuts.Dates can also be added for additional sweetness, as well as walnuts and almonds.This dish is served with a custard sauce, and there are a few variations in the recipe.Some cookbooks call for whole eggs and a bit of water, others just use egg yolks.Although most would simmer the sauce directly in the saucepan, I prefer to whisk it in a double-boiler to make sure I don’t get lumps.When it has thickened, it needs to be refrigerated for about two hours, with a lid on so that the surface does not crust over.If it gets too stiff to pour after being chilled, just whisk in a tablespoon or two of cold water and it should flow when poured.Serve the royal pudding cold with the custard sauce on the side or poured generously over the dessert just before serving.Here’s wishing our Agong a happy birthday, and everyone can enjoy the holiday with a dessert fit for a king.Puding rajaIngredientsJala emas5 yolks from duck eggs1 cup sugar2 cups cold water1 pandan leafCaramelised bananas12 bananas, peeled1 tbsp butter or ghee2 cups cooking oilCustard sauce3 egg yolks3 tbsp sugar1 tin (390ml) evaporated milk1 tsp custard powder1 pandan leafGarnish100g prunes, seeded and halved25g red glacé cherries, halved25g green glacé cherries, halved125g cashew nutsMethodFor the jala emas batter, whisk egg yolks until fluffy, then strain through a wire sieve.Fill batter into a squeeze bottle with a narrow nozzle and set aside, or if you are using a jala mould, fill only when needed.Fill a saucepan with water, sugar and pandan leaf, and bring to a boil. Then remove pandan leaf and bring down the heat to a slow simmer.Drizzle batter into the simmering syrup from a height to get fine strands in a circular motion starting from the outer wall of the saucepan into the centre.Allow the strands to cook for about 30 seconds before lifting them out with a slotted ladle or chopsticks.Repeat four or five times with the remaining batter.For the caramelised bananas, heat cooking oil with butter or ghee.When oil reaches frying temperature, add bananas in whole and fry on all sides until light golden.Drain excess oil on kitchen paper. In the remaining oil, fry the cashew nuts until light golden.For the custard sauce, whisk eggs, milk, sugar and custard powder until combined.Strain through a wire sieve into a bain marie or double boiler, then add pandan leaf and turn the heat on low.Continue whisking until the sauce starts to thicken on a low simmer, then turn off the heat.Strain cooked custard sauce through a wire sieve, cover with a lid and keep in a chiller until needed.To serve, arrange caramelised bananas on the bottom of the dish.Cover bananas with a layer of jala emas, then garnish with fruit and nuts. Serve with custard sauce.\n",

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "CHESTER CHIN\n",
      "News that the 99-year-old Coliseum Cafe is shutting down for good has caused dismay amongst Malaysian foodies and historians alike. This 2014 story by our Travel writer Chester Chin perfectly encapsulates just why it is such a huge loss to our country's heritage.This story originally appeared in StarLifestyle on 31 August 2014, and has been edited for brevity and clarity.The sconce on the stained wall at the back of Coliseum Café’s dining area hasn’t lit up for a while now. But the lamp’s faulty nature isn’t reason enough to warrant a brand new replacement - not when the item in question is a relic that’s almost a century old.The Western colonial-themed restaurant has been operating since 1921 and in many ways, its dated interior mirrors just that. Antiquated furniture adorns the old mosaic tiled floor, accentuating nostalgia in this quaint venue along the bustling Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman in Kuala Lumpur.At one point during our conversation, the restaurant’s operation manager Jufri Kenneth Abdullah lifts up the tablecloth to reveal the aged wooden surface of the table we are seated at.“For your information, this is 100 years old. This is the same table used back in the restaurant’s early days, ” he reveals, “and so is that coat hanger, ceiling fan and bar top.”He adds that the bar section of the restaurant - once off-limits to the fairer sex - resembles the original arrangements in the 1950s. Framed advertisements from the 1920s and 1930s still hang above the area today.The reason for preserving the café the way it was is history, he says.It’s an incredibly practical logic when you consider that Coliseum Café has weathered many significant milestones in the country.The restaurant stood tall throughout the British colonial rule, the Japanese occupation, Malaya’s independence, the formation of Malaysia and, if you want to put things in a more modern context, the millennium.“In the early days, Coliseum was more of an exclusive dining place. You had to be in proper attire - coat and tie - to dine in. These days, people can just come in shorts and T-shirts, ” Jufri Kenneth says.According to him, the restaurant used to be a favourite haunt among the British colonial crowd when it first opened. By the 1950s, planters and tin miners reportedly gathered on Friday evenings to discuss anti-communist strategies.“Today, we place ourselves as a casual family dining restaurant, ” stresses Jufri Kenneth.Coliseum Café has withstood the test of time. In 2013, the restaurant opened its second outlet at Plaza 33 in Petaling Jaya and was recognised by the Malaysia Book of Records as the “Longest Operating Western Colonial-Themed Restaurant”. They also added a third outlet at Mid Valley Megamall in Kuala Lumpur. In 2014, the venue celebrated its 93rd anniversary in the local culinary scene.Reportedly started by a group of business partners from Hainan Island in China, the restaurant has seen its fair share of famous diners, including the first Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.Acclaimed cartoonist Datuk Mohammad Nor Khalid, endearingly known as Lat, even left behind caricatures of customers who have dined at the venue.Of course, the food is a big part of the draw.“What you see here are all retained from the past, ” Jufri Kenneth says of the menu.The perennial favourites, he says, are the baked crabmeat, homemade oxtail soup, Hainanese fried noodles and “anything that has to do with sizzling”. Of course, one can’t possibly disregard the Hainanese chicken chop - an aspect that’s as ubiquitous as the old Hainanese cooks who prepared them in the past.Although it primarily catered to the British when it first opened, Jufri Kenneth is an ardent believer in Coliseum Café being a thoroughly Malaysian restaurant today.“The Hainanese brought their own style of cooking, the Indians brought the spices and some Malay cooking influences make the food served here Malaysian cuisine.“Dining at Coliseum is actually a walk down memory lane. My father used to bring me here when I was a boy. Back then, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman was known as Batu Road and it was a two-way street.After a brief pause, he adds: “I bring my kids here and eventually, I’m sure they will bring theirs too.”\n",

      "Well, here we are, stuck at home again. I guess it’s back to making drinks at home again, huh?Well, since we’ve already covered what sorts of spirits, liqueurs, and syrups you should have in your home bar, let us now talk about the sort of tools you need to recreate your favourite cocktails at home.Now, before we get into the sorts of bar tools that are out there, it should be pointed out that you don’t HAVE to get these tools for your home, as there are plenty of utensils in your kitchen that can be used for the same purpose. For instance, a cookie jar can be used as a cocktail shaker, baking measuring spoons can replace jiggers, a chopstick can stir a drink just as well as a fancy bar spoon... well, you get the picture.However, while these replacements will get your drink made, they don’t offer the same experience as using some proper bar tools.“We feel that having the right tools will give you more joy and better results in what you are making, ” says Nathan Pinto, co-founder of The 4 Barmen, a Malaysian startup that specialises in making good quality and affordable bar tools.“Sure, you can mix cocktails using a water jug at home, however, with a proper cocktail shaker, you have better control when mixing and shaking drinks with finesse.“Working with ‘make-do’ tools will get the job done, but using proper tools, the whole experience will be exceptionally better and becomes more fun. The results also taste and look better, ” Pinto adds.The 4 Barmen was formed when the four founders – who are cocktail enthusiasts, but not professional bartenders – realised that the options for bar tools in the Malaysian market were limited. Hence, they decided to take matters into their own hands and set up a store offering high quality bar tools and glassware at a reasonable price, with more elegant finishes, in order to inspire Malaysians to create more cocktails at home. Their store includes three levels of Starter kits suitable for home bartenders, depending on the skill level of the user.With that in mind, let’s learn about the different sorts of bartools and what they are used for, with some help from bartender Shawn Chong of the Mizukami Collective and Bar Class Academy Asia.ShakerThe primary function of a shaker is to mix, chill, aerate, and dilute a cocktail. There are two main types of shakers that are commonly used in bars – the Cobbler and the Boston.The main difference between the two is obviously the shape and size. Also known as a three-piece shaker, the Cobbler is the one that looks like a little metal bottle, while the larger Boston shaker is commonly made up of two large vessels, usually made of metal, though some are a combination of metal and glass vessels.“A Cobbler shaker generally fits one or two drinks depending on volume, while a Boston can accommodate three to four, ” Chong says.“The Boston shaker is also more efficient in making drinks that have solid items like fruit, herbs and spices as well as well drinks that call for cream or dairy. The space in the shaker eases the frothing capability.”According to him, the Boston shaker is also more versatile as open vessels are easier and faster to clean, so a Boston Shaker wins on hygiene.The cobbler shaker, on the other hand, has an in-built strainer at the top and so is favourable for cocktails that don't call for any fresh herbs, purees or pulp.JiggerWith a distinctive hourglass shape, the jigger is a bartenders' measuring tool.“Just like baking, accuracy is required to create balanced cocktails by respecting the proportions a recipe calls for. It's far faster and more efficient than using a scale, though a scale would win at point accuracy, ” says Chong.Mixing GlassA mixing glass is used to stir a cocktail rather than shake it, as this allows you to maintain better control over the amount of dilution, and also maintain the texture and viscosity of the drink better.Sure, you can just use a normal glass or a jar to mix drinks, but many bartenders tend to use specially crafted mixing glasses. This is not just for the aesthetics – some professional mixing glasses, like the Yarai mixing glass (named after the Japanese diamond pattern etched on the outside) are made with a heavy base, uses thicker glass, has a spout at the top for easy pouring, and the pattern at the side makes it easier to hold while using.Bar spoonA spoon is just a spoon, right? Well, not when it’s a bar spoon. “While its primary function is for stirring cocktails, It can also be used to measure smaller quantities instead of using a jigger, as a bar spoon usually measures three to four millilitres of liquid, ” says Chong.A bar spoon can also be used for layering spirits on top of one another, either by pouring the spirit over the underside of the spoon, or by using the spiral stem.Some bar spoons also either come with a fork on the other end (which can be used for skewering garnishes or squeezing citrus directly from fruit wedges), or a muddler. Which brings us to...MuddlerThe muddler is used to crush fruits, herbs or spices to extract its flavour properties. The size of the muddler doesn't matter, though a larger one usually requires less effort.StrainerBartenders commonly use two types of strainers – Hawthorne strainers and conventional mesh strainers.A Hawthorne strainer is usually paired with a Boston shaker to hold muddled items and ice, as the ice shouldn't be reused once a drink is made. It commonly comes with prongs that sit at the lip of the shaker.\"A Hawthorne Strainer with no prongs serves the same purpose but is very useful for bartenders to use the ‘throw’ technique,\" says Chong. \"The throw technique allows for a slower dilution rate than shaking and more aeration than stirring yielding a different end result to a cocktail.\"According to Chong, most of the time, a normal mesh strainer would be sufficient for straining your drinks, but there are times when you need to ‘fine strain’ it as well.Fine straining means using both a Hawthorne Strainer AND a mesh strainer together in order to effectively remove any smaller particles that a Hawthorne can't hold back. It is also used to ensure a nice smooth froth/foam should the cocktail need it.Bar bladeA bar blade is a bottle opener that's meant for high volume bars where bottled drinks like beer are served a lot, according to Chong.“Its length usually causes the blade protrude from a bartender's pocket for easy access and with a long blade it creates a better fulcrum making it easier to open the caps. The long blade also allows bartenders to do tricks/flair in hopes to earn some tips!” he says.Snag extra discounts on your bartending tools with Lazada Discount CodeMichael Cheang used to shake cocktails using a plastic cookie jar.

      "IAN LAU - RETRO RECIPE\n",
      "LAKSA is a dish that has a different meaning depending on where you come from.Although by definition laksa is a spicy noodle soup, various states in Malaysia have their own spin on this dish, each offering a different culinary experience.Sarawak laksa became world famous when the late Anthony Bourdain claimed that this “breakfast of the gods” is “one of the foods served in heaven” and featured it twice in his shows --- for Travel Channel’s No Reservations and CNN’s Parts Unknown.I discovered when preparing it that Sarawak’s laksa is distinctive not so much for the combination of herbs and spices in the broth.The biggest difference is how it is thickened not just with coconut milk but with roasted ground sesame seeds and peanuts.This recipe, one of the simpler made-from-scratch Sarawak laksa recipes, was previously published in Flavours magazine, and is stored in the Kuali.com archives.However, even many true-blood Sarawakians are opting for ready-made spice paste because of the many components required before cooking the dish.Do not be intimidated by the number of ingredients though.Some of the roasting and toasting of ingredients can be done ahead of time, and even the broth can be prepared a day before if coconut milk is added just before serving.While laksa from other states are served with either laksa noodles (Penang, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang), wheat noodles with or without rice vermicelli (Perak, Selangor and Melaka), or spaghetti (Johor), Sarawak laksa uses only rice vermicelli.A Sarawak laksa stall at a Chinese coffeeshop in Petaling Jaya uses Sarawak mee kolo noodles and I learned from my colleague Tina Loh from Kuching that this is not the norm.She advised that laksa in Kuching is only served with chicken.Combined with prawns, these two meats provide proteins to enrich the broth and garnish the dish.Some recipes also include sliced fish cake as a topping, which you may add if desired.One topping missing from this recipe, though, is julienne omelette.Loh says the egg is a crucial ingredient and remembers from having helped her mum cook the dish at home.I decided to include it too.Although Loh also insisted on belacan in the sambal condiment, this recipe listed only dried shrimps.I felt that it was essentially the same basic ingredient but in different form, as everyone was wowed by its taste despite the absence of belacan.You may add belacan if you wish.I know that although it may not be viewed as authentic by many Sarawakians, I hope this recipe makes a good tribute to their state dish.

Strain the broth through a wire sieve and discard the heads and shells.Bring the stock to a boil and add prawns, poach for five minutes until cooked.Then cool down completely before splitting each prawn into two halves.Bring the stock back to a boil and add meat.If using chicken, poach for 10 to 15 minutes over medium heat until fully cooked, then remove from the heat to cool down before shredding.If using pork, poach for 20 to 30 minutes over medium heat until tender, then remove from the heat to cool down before shredding.To make the sambal, blend all ingredients with a little oil in an electric mill into a fine paste.Heat the oil in a frying pan and saute the sambal paste until fragrant and oil separates. Set aside.To make the spice paste, blend all the ingredients with a little oil into a fine paste.Heat the oil in a frying pan and saute the spice paste until fragrant, then add sesame seeds, peanuts, curry powder and seasonings.To make the laksa broth, place the spice paste in a large saucepan and add stock and coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat, adding more stock if necessary, to adjust its consistency.To serve, divide the vermicelli among bowls and ladle the broth over it, then garnish and serve piping hot with sambal.\n",

      "VEGETARIAN goose got its name not because it tastes like goose meat but because of its crispy texture that resembles the skin of roast goose.It is made completely out of foo pei, or bean curd skin, and is seasoned with a mixture of red fermented bean curd and five spice powder.It is said to have been invented by Buddhist monks in Hangzhou, China, and is one of the first vegetarian dishes that, although having a meat moniker, doesn’t really mimic the real thing – unlike many other mock meats.It is not often prepared at home because not many people like to deep-fry, so it is usually bought ready-made.However, it is not really difficult to make because it only contains a few ingredients, and the oil can be reused for other dishes.The most important step is to keep your packages neat without the raw edges of the bean curd skin breaking into the oil.This is done by folding the edges of the bean curd skin towards the centre until you get a package that has all the raw edges tucked into a narrow rectangle.Then secure the packages with toothpicks so they do not open up when frying.Some recipes give instructions to poke holes into the packages before frying to release the air bubbles.I find this method allows too much oil to penetrate into the folds of the packages, making it crispy all the way inside but very greasy.I prefer to puncture the bubbles as they emerge so that it’s less greasy and still soft inside.Unless you can multitask, I recommend frying the packages one at a time so that the oil temperature doesn’t lower too much and it is easier to handle any erupting bubbles.The vegetarian goose should be consumed immediately although it can stay crispy for a few hours.If left out for too long, it can be made crispy again in a toaster oven at 150°C for 10 minutes, but it should not be fried again.You may serve it as an appetiser with a sweet Thai chilli sauce.Vegetarian gooseIngredients3 sheets bean curd skin3 cups cooking oilsweet chilli sauceMarinade3 cubes red fermented beancurd150ml cold water1½ tsp icing sugar½ tsp light soy sauce½ tsp five spice powderMethodIn a small bowl, break up bean curd cubes with a little water before adding in the remaining water. Add sugar, soy sauce and five spice powder and whisk together until combined.Spread open the bean curd skins and arrange on a countertop.Stack them neatly one on top of the other and cut into quarters with kitchen shears.Take one quarter sheet of bean curd skin and brush the marinade seasoning all over the surface.Place another sheet on top and brush lightly with a layer of marinade.Fold the long ends of the bean curd sheet to meet in the centre, then fold in the sides, making sure that the raw edges are tucked into the inside of the bean curd package.Use toothpicks to secure both ends and one in the centre to hold the piece in place. Then continue to brush and fold remaining sheets until you get six bean curd packages.The final packages should measure about 7x20cm, each consisting of about 16 layers of bean curd skin.Heat oil in a frying pan and deep-fry packages one at a time until golden brown.Use a bamboo skewer to puncture the packages as you fry so that the bubbles do not suddenly burst and splatter oil all over the place.Remove toothpicks after frying, cut into slices and serve immediately with sweet chilli sauce.Get your favourite vegetarian meals delivered to your doorstep.

      "Steak, rare? Why not, as long as it's grown in-vitro. That's the conclusion of a study published last week regarding attitudes to consuming meat grown in a laboratory.Conducted collaboratively by two American universities and one British, the study, available in the Foods journal, aims to understand the state of mind of different generations facing the emergence of alternative meat production. These in-vitro proteins are made from animal cells and then grown in test tubes. This type of cultivation presents an alternative to traditional breeding whose consequences on the environment are disastrous.The younger the generation, the more in favour of in-vitro meatTo find out more about perceptions of what not long ago seemed like a meal out of a work of science fiction, the researchers interviewed adults of different age groups.The study was conducted on representative samples of the American and British populations. And appetites vary depending on the generation. About 89% of GenZers are inclined to consume it and have a positive view of the subject. A similar percentage is found among millennials (85%).Boomers, on the other hand, are less open, with just 77% \"at least somewhat open\" to trying lab-raised meat.In vitro meat vs farmed meatOn average, those who took part in the study said that this new type of protein could make up 37-42% of their diet's meat in the future.Generally, answers suggested that many expected farmed meat to remain on their plates and that this new form of protein would make up a \"partial, rather than full, replacement for meat\".In their study, the researchers found that \"despite growing evidence of the environmental and public health threats posed by today's intensive animal production, consumers in the west remain largely attached to meat.\"It is therefore difficult to predict whether this type of meat will become widespread. It will be necessary above all to convince a public that has been fed on farmed meat, although it may become easier as younger generations become purchasers for their households. – AFP Relaxnews\n",

      "Climate change is threatening our tea consumption. A recent report shows that extreme weather conditions are likely to alter the taste of the world's most widely consumed beverage. By 2050, a quarter of the tea plants in India and Kenya could have disappeared.Wine, rice, chocolate, coffee, etc. The list of foods threatened by global warming is long. And now we can add tea to it. Floods, heat waves, hurricanes... these meteorological events are becoming increasingly frequent due to climate change and threatening tea growing areas in the world.This is particularly the case in Kenya, the world's largest exporter of black tea. In this African country, the number of tea plants could decrease considerably in the coming decades, and even dwindle by a quarter by 2050, according to a new report by British charity Christian Aid.But the effects of the climate crisis could be felt long in another way before a possible tea shortage. Like some wines, the taste of tea could be altered and have less flavor than the tea we're used to drinking. Indeed, flooding and increased rainfall could alter the subtle flavors of the tea leaf and potentially reduce its health benefits, the report says.\"\"[W]hen tea plants get really wet they suffer a double whammy because the plants stop having the ecological cues to make these metabolites and the few that are there get diluted as the plant gets waterlogged,\" explain the study authors.A threat that also threatens other major tea-producing regions, including China, India and Sri Lanka. To prevent these adverse effects on tea, which remains the most consumed beverage in the world, the report suggests several courses of action, including strengthening international policies dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing climate financing to help countries and farmers adapt to climate change.The charity also stresses the need to cancel the debt of poor countries (already heavily burdened by the pandemic), in order to give them \"the fiscal space to better respond to the impacts of climate change. These recommendations are made in view of the COP26, which will be held in November in the city of Glasgow, Scotland. – AFP RelaxnewsQuench your thirst with tasty beverages.

      "SUZANNE LAZAROO\n",
      "A 'laksa war' has broken out amongst Malaysian netizens recently. But what are the different types of laksa in Malaysia? Here is a story from our archives where we explored the different interpretations in each state and region.This story originally appeared on StarLifestyle in two parts on 27 August and 3 September 2017, and has been edited for brevity and clarity.Flavour-drenched, hit-the-spot comfort food, a rush of spices or a hit of bracing tang, made with wheat noodles, rice noodles or even al dente spaghetti – laksa has many faces, and they’re all delicious.At its heart, it’s a dish of noodles in a spiced gravy, which can have a creamy coconut milk base or a sour asam base. A bowlful then brims with fish flakes, prawns, chicken and even blood cockles or roast pork, and shredded cucumber, pineapple, bean sprouts and herbs... and often, a spoonful of fiery sambal or pungent prawn paste, making the dish further customisable to each diner.In Malaysia, the different incarnations of laksa are bound by more than just a loose structure and character, of noodles in gravy – daun kesum is also called laksa leaf, because it’s used so extensively in the various versions of the dish. Most laksas are perfumed by it, along with other herbs and spices.Sound simple? It’s not. Here, almost every state has its own version of laksa, and broad interpretations of the one dish can also span hazy regional borders – such as laksam which is a white-on-white dish of thick, rustic rice noodle rolls in a pale, rich gravy of coconut milk and fish (or more rarely, eel), popular in the northern states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Kedah.“When you look at the styles in Peninsular Malaysia especially, it feels like there is a natural geographical progression from north to south, from the more sour, thin gravies to the creamy, rich ones, ” said celebrity chef Isadora Chai.“Malaysians are very familiar with and possessive of their own regional or state laksas – I think there’s an emotional connection for a lot of people, who have been eating a particular laksa all their lives, ” she said.You also find laksa in Thailand, where it’s called khanom jeen, made with rice noodles and also manifesting in various incarnations, and in Indonesia, where permutations of the dish are specific to towns and cities. In Singapore, the coconut milk-based Katong laksa is extremely popular, traceable to the Straits Chinese community based in the Katong precinct.There are various origin theories for laksa – in different countries, usually traceable to interactions between Chinese traders or settlers, who brought their own thin noodle soups with them, and locals, who then decked out those broths with local herbs and spices, and coconut milk.While it’s difficult to pinpoint its specific origins in Malaysia, in states like Melaka and Penang especially – both enclaves of the Peranakan community – the dish seems to have been born among the ranks of the Peranakans, the descendants of Chinese traders marrying local Malays.What is evident though, as you contemplate such a lush bowl of plenty, is that it is a fusion of sorts, in the best sense of the word – cultures, states and regions contributing various elements to come up with an extremely delicious whole.Currying flavourCurry laksa is thick and rich, with just a hint of sweetness from the addition of thick coconut milk.Possibly the best examples are the ones you find in the Klang Valley and Melaka, which are usually garnished with tofu pok (bean curd puffs), chicken, fish cake slices, prawns, blood cockles and long beans. The finishing touch? That spoonful of sambal and a scattering of mint.\"Melaka laksa is quite straightforward to cook, because there’s no fish involved, you don’t have to flake the fish flesh, so it’s the fastest to cook, ” said recipe developer and cookbook author Debbie Teoh.In Penang, where curry laksa is also known as curry mee, there are two variants of the dish using yellow Hokkien noodles – one served doused in chicken curry the colour of a fiery sunrise, the other in a pale, thin coconut milk base (this has now come to be known as white curry mee).Aromatic chilli paste is then added according to one’s taste. In white curry mee, the Chinese side of laksa’s identity is manifested strongly – via cubes of congealed pork blood!“Curry mee is what I’d choose if I wanted something creamy yet light, ” said Teoh.Asam-based laksasThe thin, sour laksas spiked with asam are usually made with asam gelugor, dried slices of the Garcinia atroviridis fruit, with its slightly astringent, clean sour hit that makes your lips pucker, as opposed to the sweet-sour pulp of asam jawa or tamarind (Tamarindus indica). Some laksas use a combination of the two and in a pinch, you can sub one for the other – only the very discerning will notice the rounder, fuller mouthfeel of tamarind.Sour, spicy and laden with the intensely fishy appeal of flaked mackerel, then perked up with turmeric and freshened with pineapple, chilli, mint, laksa leaves and bunga kantan (torch ginger flower), Penang’s asam laksa is deservedly famous – and it’s still not asam laksa until a spoonful of pungent hae kor (fermented prawn paste) is stirred into the heady mix.“Ikan parang is the best fish to use – it’s sweet, with a melt-in-the-mouth texture – but it’s also the most work to get the flesh off the many small bones, ” said Teoh.In July 2011, CNN Travel ranked the dish at No. 7 for deliciousness, in a list of 50 foods in the world (later that year, a public poll saw it fall to the 26th rung though).Perlis and Kedah laksas are similar, but the former is often made with catfish or eel, while the latter sees hard-boiled egg slices added, as well as various ulam. Malay sellers tend to serve it with a spoonful of sambal nyiur, or coconut sambal.In this way, laksa also illustrates the differences in area, highlighting the produce farmed or produced in a state – such as the use of freshwater eels, fresh rice noodles in the rice-rich northern states, or the fact that Johor doesn’t really grow rice much – as well as cultural influences from the ethnic communities in an area.Hybrid offeringsAnd then there are laksas that defy convention like the laksa Siam found in Penang and Kedah that is a further fusion of both asam and curry laksa!This rich laksa is sour and fishy like asam laksa, and rich with spices and coconut cream at the same time – what you would call the best of both worlds.In Johor, the creamy laksa gravy – enriched with asam gelugor as well as lemongrass, galangal and dried prawns – is characteristically served with spaghetti, making its fusion roots stretch further beyond borders than most.According to Kalsom Taib and Hamidah Abdul Hamid in Johor Palate: Tanjung Puteri Recipes, Johor’s well-travelled Sultan Abu Bakar (who ruled the state from 1886 to 1895) loved pasta from his first visit to Italy; he instructed his chefs to switch out the traditional noodles for the pasta, and Johor laksa was born.Heading EastOn Malaysia’s East Coast, a tale of two laksas is told.Skirting the coasts of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang – and finding their way to Johor on occasion – these are the Rose Red and Snow White of a very different (and delicious) fairy tale.Siblings, they are laced with the fish and coconut milk that you would expect from their lands of origin, but manifest quite differently.The kuah putih, or white gravy, sees its noodles in a simpler, cleaner, milder gravy. It’s particularly popular in Kelantan, where it’s synonymous with the eponymous Laksa Kelantan.In the state, its purity of colour is maintained by the common use of tenggiri, with its marble-pale flesh, in homes. If you buy it from a street vendor though, you’re likely to find the cheaper ikan kembung instead.Laksa kuah putih gives the humble white pepper a dominant role in a way that few dishes do – it’s the predominant flavour in the thick coconut milk gravy, with a supporting cast of shallots, ginger and lemongrass. A squeeze of lime freshens the gravy after its slow cooking treatment.It’s a gravy that is similar to the one that bathes laksam; what differentiates them is the thick, rustic rice rolls that you’ll find in laksam.Both dishes are finished with a generous handful of vegetables and fragrant herbs – finely-sliced long beans, bean sprouts, cucumber, with Thai (daun selasih) or holy (daun kemangi) basil and the ubiquitous laksa leaf (daun kesum).“Terengganu is the only state where both laksa kuah putih and kuah merah – which we also call ‘kuah masak’ – are offered alongside for choice in the markets, ” To’ Puan Rosita Abdullah, author of Kayu Manis: A Tribute to Terengganu told Flavours magazine in a 2012 article.“The Terengganu kuah masak uses less fish, unlike in Pahang, where the gravy is thicker. The laksa paste can easily be bought in the market and fish used could be tenggiri, kembung or selayang.“The fresh green topping can include shredded brinjal and daun jambu golok (cashew nut shoots).”Because of its comparative mildness, you’ll find laksa kuah putih eaten for breakfast more often.Also based on coconut milk, kuah merah has extra fish power – in addition to the fresh ikan kembung or tenggiri it’s usually made with, the deeper, more layered flavour of salted fish is also often discernible.In addition to the other toppings, the intensely orange-yolked salted duck egg can also be a topping, as can daun kaduk (wild pepper leaf).“People usually make one or the other, ” said Datin Munira Salinger, in Red & White Laksas (Flavours, 2012).In the Pahang-born former teacher’s autobiography, My Story, you’ll find illustrations of her long-held enthusiasm for researching the history and culture of Malay food in particular, with some of her favourite recipes.She says that the kuah merah is a grander dish with more planning and prep involved, and so usually saved for more elaborate functions, rather than one-dish meals at home.“It is something that one gives to family members living nearby – often sent in a tiffin carrier as a gift, and one would provide enough to feed the whole family, ” she said.Sarawakian sensationHopping across the South China Sea, you’ll find Sarawak Laksa – a dish so fabulously rich that it sees foodies’ ears pricking up all over the country at the mere mention.While its home state boasts the most proliferation, you’ll also find it in Sabah, and in neighbouring Brunei.The fact that Sarawak laksa is made from a paste with a multitude of ingredients that also remains a jealously-guarded secret only adds to its mystery-wreathed allure.Often, when you find the dish on a menu in Peninsular Malaysia, it’s been made with the paste specially-ordered from Sarawak; a few adventurous chefs do attempt to replicate it solely by taste, but Sarawak laksa is unique in its common status as being more often made from a paste made and imported from its home state. This is so even when the dish is cooked at home.The fiery, crimson gravy is laced with spices like cumin, star anise, fennel, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, white pepper and coriander, and includes a chunk of belacan along with the ginger, chillies, lemongrass, galangal and shallots. Both chicken and prawn stocks are used, and there are also roasted, ground peanuts, sesame seeds and candlenuts in there.That explains its distinctive, delicious complexity and richness, but the key is in getting the ratio of every ingredient right.Its origins, like those of many local dishes, are anchored more in lore than stone.There’s a legend that in 1945, Goh Lik Teck, a Teochew migrant from Guangzhou, China, started selling a simpler version of the dish – with just six ingredients – in Kuching’s Carpenter Street.Another story has the laksa emerging from the Chinese and Malay cultural collusion, rather than just one noodle-seller.In the 1960s, Goh’s family started making and selling the paste to other vendors; around the same time, businessman Tan Yong Him started selling the paste commercially under the Swallow brand, and other bird-oriented brands soon followed suit.Laksa paste and intense gravy aside, the other building blocks of Sarawak laksa are rice vermicelli, shreds of chicken and omelette, prawns and fresh coriander leaves. A spoonful of piquant sambal and lime halves are always served on the side.And that’s the dish that Anthony Bourdain tweeted was the “breakfast of the gods” in 2015, when he revisited Kuching’s famous Choon Hui Cafe for CNN’s Parts Unknown; it was his second visit to the very same coffee shop, after his 2005 stop there for the Travel Channel’s No Reservations.Order popular Malaysian cuisine at discounted prices by using foodpanda Voucher\n",

      "Just over a decade ago, American plant-based meat producers like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods seemed like the archetypal outliers dreaming of big things that no one had ever heard about, much less thought was possible.The two were the earliest producers of plant-based meats and launched their products in an era fraught with skepticism and disbelief.Fast forward a decade later and both brands are behemoths in the plant-based alternative protein space which has become both crowded and lucrative.Global growth has been so positive that a recent report by Boston Consulting Group and Blue Horizon Corporation indicates that although alternative proteins accounted for 2% of the world protein market in 2020, this figure is likely to go up to 11% by 2035.This means that in under 20 years, nearly 1/10th of the protein consumed around the world will potentially take the form of an alternative protein.What is plant-based meat?‘Alternative protein’ is an umbrella term used to describe protein-rich products sourced from plants, insects, fungi or through muscle tissue grown in labs with cells harvested from real animals (cell-cultured meat).Of these available options, plant-based meat has been the most visible and successful since first hitting mainstream consciousness 10 years ago with the introduction of Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat’s realistic burger patties.Since then, the plant-based meat market has gained the bulk of investments – USD2.1bil (RM8.6 bil) in investments in 2020 (paired together with plant-based egg and dairy) compared to USD360mil (RM1.4bil) for cultivated meat and USD590mil (RM2.4bil) for fermentation companies, according to data released by The Good Food Institute Asia Pacific (GFI APAC), a non-profit organisation that aims to expedite growth of the alternative protein sector.This is buoyed by an increasingly global consumer base, introduced to these products via a growing number of fast-food chains, supermarkets and restaurants around the world.So what are plant-based meats? Plant-based meats, also known as meat analogues are essentially plant-derived products designed to closely resemble the physical appearance, taste, texture and structure of their original protein counterpart, whether that’s chicken, beef, lamb or other animal products.Plant-based meat primarily takes two forms – whole muscle meat and restructured meat. Whole muscle meat is meant to mimic whole animal muscle structures like chicken breasts and steaks while restructured meat (which seems to be more prevalent in the plant-based space) is essentially plant-based replicas of products like nuggets, meat strips, minced meat, burger patties, sausages and luncheon meat, to name a few.The products are usually fashioned out of a range of ingredients that can include grains and legumes including soy, wheat, rice, peas, chickpeas, lentils and mung beans which are converted into flours, isolates and concentrates. Flavours, colour components, minerals, carbohydrates and fats like coconut oil and canola oil are often also included in the overall formulation.The Beyond Meat burger patty for instance, features pea protein isolate as a hero ingredient alongside mung beans, brown rice, coconut oil and cocoa butter while Impossible Foods contain potato, soy, coconut oil and flavour from a molecule called heme.To concoct a believable product both in terms of taste and texture, plant-based meats typically go through either one of two processes – dry extrusion or wet extrusion, which basically enables plant proteins to combine with other ingredients to form a successful formulation while eliminating unwanted flavours, aromas and textures.“Ultimately, the choice of creating plant-based alternatives using dry or wet processes is a market decision. High-moisture products can provide better texture options such as meat-like fibres but will also require cold chains to be distributed. Dry products can travel, be stored more easily, and later be rehydrated, making it often more suitable for business-to-business distribution. Supply chains will decide which ones fit their needs best, ” says Adrien Beauvisage, head of region for South-East Asia and Oceania for Bühler, a Swiss multinational company which specialises in food technology.The corporation – alongside Swiss food flavour mavens Givaudan, recently set up Singapore’s ground-breaking Protein Innovation Centre.The Asian plant-based meat marketWhile the initial success of plant-based meats was centred in America and Europe, plant-based proteins have very quickly established a firm footing in the Asia Pacific region, an acceleration that has been fuelled in part by the Covid-19 global pandemic, which has driven changes in consumer perception, awareness and general enthusiasm for plant-based meats.This increased acceptance of plant-based meats was at first generated by a fear of eating animal products spurred by reports that the Covid-19 virus might have originated from the consumption of wild animals in a market in Wuhan, China.But on a larger scale the pandemic has caused a seismic shift in thinking, with many Asians now more informed and interested in issues like sustainability and health. This interest has also been enhanced by increased availability of plant-based meats and improvements in the taste and texture of these proteins.“There is compelling evidence that the global pandemic further accelerated a shift towards alternative proteins that was already gaining steam across Asia Pacific. During the first two months after the coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong-based plant-based meat company Green Monday reported that online sales more than doubled.“Similar surges were documented in Korea and other major Asian markets, which helps explain why investment in Asia Pacific-based alternative protein companies was 600% higher in 2020 than 2019, ” says Mirte Gosker, the acting managing director of GFI APAC.Research published by nutrition company Herbalife Nutrition in December 2020 backs these claims up. The study polled 8,000 people in the Asia Pacific region and found that 41% of respondents, especially in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines now display a greater openness to plant-based food options.Meanwhile, another study conducted by DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences found that 78% of Asians now believe plant-based meats are here to stay.This turn of events is interesting, because plant-based meats are not actually new in some parts of Asia, like China. In fact, old-school soy based mock meat and plant-based meat replacements like tofu and tempeh have been around for eons. The difference is, these products catered to niche, often domestic markets and never really gained an international audience.The 2.0 versions of plant-based meats on the other hand, seemed to have reeled in not only vegan and vegetarian fans but also meat-eaters who want to make meaningful changes to their diets, in line with the growing flexitarian and reducetarian global movements.According to plant-based egg producer Eat Just’s founder Josh Tetrick, “The demographics for Just Egg in South-East Asia are similar to those who enjoy the product in the United States and elsewhere in the world.“They’re 21-50-year-olds who care about eating a little bit better when they’re at home or on the go and realise their food choices not only make them healthier but contribute positively to the world around them. When the choice is delicious, convenient and accessible, switching to plant-based is easy.”While broadening the mass market appeal of new-fangled plant-based meats will be pivotal in expanding its reach in Asia, in many ways, many countries in the region already have an advantage, having been exposed to conventional plant-based meat replacements for ages now. It is this familiarity with plant-based meat substitutes that is likely to accelerate the movement in Asia a lot quicker than many other regions around the world.In fact, Zion Market Research’s 2020 report indicated that by 2025 (a mere four years away), the Asia Pacific region will hold the largest share of the global plant-based market due to familiarity with soy-based vegan proteins as well as growing environmental consciousness.“The demand and familiarity with meat alternatives already exists in Asia, which allows a new generation of meat alternatives, with better taste and nutrition profile, to grow even faster, ” affirms Beauvisage.Supply channelsThe increase in demand for plant-based meats among Asia Pacific consumers aligns with the growing number of start-ups and legacy brands developing their own range of plant-based meats.In Thailand for instance, plant-based meat firm Let’s Plant Meat put together its plant-based patty fashioned out of soy in just 12 months, and now sells it in Thailand for half the price of Beyond Meat.Other success stories include Malaysian-based Phuture Daging, which sells minced meat made out of soy, rice, peas and chickpea protein that is available in Singapore and Malaysia; Hong Kong start-up OmniMeat, which makes meat strips, mince and luncheon meat crafted out of shiitake mushrooms, pea, soy and rice and has a presence in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia; and South Korean brand Unlimeat’s plant-based beef, made from surplus grains that would otherwise be discarded. Unlimeat has successfully penetrated a few key markets like Hong Kong and even the United States.Conventional legacy brands like Nestle have also stepped up their game in Asia. Nestle’s Harvest Gourmet plant-based meat range in South-East Asia is processed in a new purpose-designed plant-based facility in Shah Alam, Selangor – the multinational giant’s first plant-focused space in the region.But perhaps nowhere has the growth and interest in plant-based proteins been more viscerally seen and felt than in Singapore, which has dashed ahead in the alternative protein game. The Singapore government has a $100bil (RM309 bil) plan to prepare for the effects of the climate crisis, and tangential to that is the goal of producing 30% of its own nutritional needs by 2030 (Singapore currently imports about 90% of its food).To facilitate this, the government has encouraged and nurtured a reputation as a food tech capital, which in turn has facilitated its rise to becoming the regional (and potentially global) epicentre of alternative proteins.This has translated into a slew of homegrown Singapore start-ups venturing into this lucrative field from Next Gen Food’s Tindle brand of plant-based chicken to Karana’s whole-plant jackfruit replacement meats.The country has also attracted numerous international brands and organisations looking to make their mark in Asia, with Singapore as their home turf.Innovative plant-based egg producer Eat Just for example, is building its first and largest plant protein production facility in Singapore and in December 2020, the company became the first in the world to get regulatory approval to sell lab-grown meat to Singaporean consumers.More recently, in April 2021, Swiss brands Buhler and Givaudan which respectively specialise in technology and food flavours, combined forces to launch the Protein Innovation Centre (PIC) – the first of its kind in Asia to accelerate plant-based foods.The centre is a one-stop space with all the equipment required to produce and test new products and the expertise to expedite product development. This technology and expertise is open to start-ups, researchers and manufacturers in Asia interested in producing plant-based alternatives and scaling production, ultimately allowing new players to make faster and more successful market entries.“By 2050, the global population will reach nearly 10 billion people and global food demand will soar by more than 50%. This will happen in challenging circumstances due the increasing impact of climate change. Finding all the protein needed to feed this ever-growing population will be a challenge, including in Asia, where roughly half of the world’s population is located.“A change in our protein diet – relying less on animal protein and more on plant-based protein – is seen as one of the most potent ways we can achieve food security. It would free up large amounts of arable land and water for human consumption.“To make it happen, it’s important that large population centres get access to plant-based products and consume larger numbers of plant-based proteins, including meat substitutes. Singapore, placed at the centre of South-East Asia and known for its cuisine derived from several ethnic groups, is a strategic location to make sure that new products developed in Asia find their audience, ” says Beauvisage.\n",

      "What if there was a non-invasive way to tell if someone in the room with you is infected with the coronavirus?British scientists say they have developed a ceiling-mounted Covid \"alarm\" that can detect anyone infected in as little as 15 minutes.The Sunday Times reports the highly accurate device, slightly larger than a smoke alarm, is being hailed as a potential boon for screening in aircraft cabins, classrooms, care homes and offices.Early studies by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Durham University have shown the device has an accuracy of 98-100%, making is as reliable as gold-standard PCR lab-based Covid-19 tests and considerably more so than quick lateral flow tests.The researchers stress that their results are at an early stage, with their work published in a paper that is yet to be peer-reviewed.The sensor, made by Cambridgeshire firm Roboscientific, works by detecting chemicals produced by the skin or present in the breath of those infected with coronavirus.These \"volatile organic compounds\" create odour too subtle to be sniffed by the human nose. A study by the Covid alarm's research team showed they could be detected by dogs, but the alarm would be more accurate and more practical.The Sunday Times says the detectors could find people with the virus even if they were yet to show symptoms, making it more effective than PCR tests, which have been found inadequate for asymptomatic carriers.It takes 15 to 30 minutes for the machines to sample the air in a large room, with the results sent instantly to a mobile phone or computer.At present, the sensors would cost around 5,000 pounds (RM28,730.80) each, the paper says. – dpa\n",

      "Thousands of health-related mobile phone applications have \"serious problems with privacy,\" according to analysis by Macquarie University in Australia.Published by the British Medical Journal (BMJ), the Sydney-based team's research into more than 20,000 apps found \"collection of personal user information\" to be \"pervasive.\"Of the almost five million apps available on platforms operated by Apple and Google, around 100,000 are health-related. However \"inadequate privacy disclosures\" often hinder users \"from making informed choices,\" said the Macquarie researchers, who compared 15,000 health, medical and fitness apps with a sample of 8,000 others.While the health apps gathered less user data than others, around two-thirds of them still \"could collect advert identifiers or cookies\" and a quarter could \"identify the mobile phone tower to which a user's device is connected.\"A quarter of the apps violated their own privacy polices, according to the BMJ research, with as many again either not providing any such terms in the first place or having \"user data transmissions\" occur via \"insecure communication channels.\"Almost 90% of \"data collection operations\" more than half of the data transmission \"were behalf of third party services, such as external advertisers, analytics, and tracking providers,\" the researchers found.Concerns about data security, particularly in \"sensitive\" areas such as health, have soared in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the deployment by dozens of governments, many of them authoritarian, of pandemic-related tracing apps.Worries have been heightened by the growing threat of cyberattack, with Ireland's health service crippled in May by a hack that has left the country in the dark about coronavirus-linked deaths and has seen personal health information leaked onto the so-called dark web. – dpa\n",

      "The pandemic might have given us many of us more time to learn a new instrument, but it also limited our options for one-on-one lessons during social distancing. How well can learning apps compete with a real teacher?Whatever you dream of playing, from Foo Fighters to \"Fuer Elise,\" countless apps and and online programs promise to help you easily learn get to grips with new chords and scales.But anyone looking around on the app store will quickly notice there are too many options out there. At the same time, you might be wondering: Can they really compete with a human teacher?Some apps take a light-hearted approach, enabling you to hit the right notes in the order, and to the right rhythm, on a virtual keyboard on your smartphone or tablet.That is not the same as a real instrument, says Volker Gerland, who works for an association of music schools in Germany. \"The pressure point is missing,\" he says. \"The size of the keys is also different on tablets.\"You may run into difficulties later on if you are hoping to switch from these digital instruments to real ones, he says, adding that isn't the best way to learn how to play the guitar.Lots of video tutorials are available online, some of them free of charge, and you can find them on the main platforms. There are even whole academies for bass players, for example, with world-class stars giving master classes, says Martin Reche of Germany's Heise online, a platform that reviews apps and devices.A series of apps help people to learn the piano, such as Skoove, Music2Me or Flowkey for learning piano, while for the guitar, there are Yousician, Fretello or JustinGuitar.Some of those apps can actively listen and provide feedback, according to Reche who tested a series of them, while others only provide a video but no feedback.For the guitar, apps offer a virtual fretboard that extends across the screen. Yousician listens to you through the built-in microphones and can tell if you're hitting the right note at the right time. \"That's how you learn to find your way around the fretboard and play melodies,\" Reche says.Apps teaching the piano work in a similar way.There are notes along the bottom of the screen, and at the top, users see a bird's-eye view of a virtual teacher's piano. It shows the fingering too, explaining which finger should hit which note and when.\"If you've always wanted to learn to play an instrument and have a small keyboard at home, for example, the apps can help you as you're starting out,\" says Reche.You might boost your motivation by playing famous pop tunes, for example - though the apps cover Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, too.But all these services can't replace a teacher, Reche says.\"They can judge whether you've played notes correctly and hit the timing, but not finger or body position.\"In the worst case scenario, if you develop a poor posture or style and there's no one around to correct it, you may wind up hampering your own progress.\"Learning an instrument just by watching videos or taking lessons online I think is very problematic,\" Gerland says. He says the poor sound quality is one factor, while also, teachers can't play well with their students online.But the apps may be good as a supplementary way to support your musical education or brush up rusty skills if it's been a while since you played, he says.Many music schools have been offering digital coaching throughout the pandemic, with lessons through videoconferences or by providing videos explaining exercises.Students typically respond by sending audio recordings for teachers to assess - which are always a good way to keep in touch and provide feedback between meetings in person.Reche notes that all the apps he tried out for mobile devices and browsers cost money. However, all offered a seven-day trial period where users could explore all the content.\"That's enough time for you to get a good idea of what they offer and work out whether their services are the right ones for you,\" says Reche.Which apps are good for practising?Apps for learning musical instruments cost roughly US$10 to US$20 a month (RM41 to RM82), and annual subscriptions are often cheaper. Before deciding on a version, it is worth checking whether the app is compatible with the device and operating system you want to practise with.Martin Reche, a tester from consumer magazine Heise online in Germany, has reviewed various solutions and reports. \"None of the tested providers did badly,\" he said. Flowkey and Yousician, for example, listened to what and how you play. Music2me, on the other hand, was the only piano-learning app in the test that also takes the piano pedal gallery into account.Skoove, on the other hand, offers the option of practising on the on-screen keyboard in the iOS app, for example on holiday. If you want to learn notes quickly, Fretello is a good choice, says Reche. JustinGuitar, on the other hand, most closely resembles \"real\" lessons. – dpa\n",

      "Complete tasks, earn coins, create avatars: Learning apps often link education with games. But not all experts and parents agree that this fun rewards system makes sense.Add, subtract or practise English on the computer - even before the pandemic, learning apps for pupils were an addition to school lessons. But in coronavirus times, they have at times become a substitute for them.\"Especially when the schools were shut from one day to the other, Anton was my salvation,\" says a primary school pupil from the district of Neukoelln in Berlin about the Anton app, which was developed in the German capital and is one of the most used.Pupils can use Anton to do exercises at home sent by the teachers. Many say that learning this way is fun, because they get instant feedback and rewards in the form of virtual coins for correct answers. With these coins, the pupils can play computer games or dress their avatars.But some parents are concerned about this rewards system. \"My six-year-old son had never had anything to do with computer games. But through homeschooling, of all things, he has started shooting asteroids. Is this necessary?\" says a Berlin mother.Another parent, a father, thinks it is questionable to constantly reward children. \"Don't they like learning on their own accord?\" he asks.Chidren lack the motivation to learn on their ownAccording to Heinz-Peter Meidinger, head of the German teachers' association, everything that encourages children to engage with school-related things outside of lessons is positive.\"But games are not an intrinsic motivation for children to learn on their own accord,\" Meidinger says.Connecting learning and play may be clever, says Christian Gross, spokesperson of the association for media addiction. \"Entry is being made easy especially for children who are already into computer games,\" he says.\"What we're offering are simply mini-games,\" says David Hoermeyer, head of the firm Solocode, which developed Anton. Many games promote concentration and have pedagogic value. \"If they kids really want to play computer games, they don't do that with Anton.\"In Hoermeyer's view, the games are a small incentive that is not interesting for everybody, as some kids don't care fore the games.Other learning programmes also work with rewards, such as the language-learning app Duolinguo, where users can also win virtual coins to unlock new levels. In the app Kekula, children can earn coins that they can exchange for YouTube videos, and Scoyo promises coins in exchange for crafting blueprints or avatars to raise spirits.Not a viable long-term model\"Someone who is learning out of interest and joy is quickly trained to learn for a reward,\" says addiction therapist Gross. Later, if the reward does not happen anymore, this can lead to frustration and, in the worst case, to children not wanting to learn anymore at all.\"In the long term it is not a good model at all to induce young people to performance or learning. It would make more sense to promote certain talents or a specific enthusiasm without constant instant rewards,\" Gross says.The development of the Anton app was funded by the EU European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Berlin Senate. According to the authorities, it is one of the most used learning apps in Germany, although the developers don't publish user statistics.Teaching association president Meidinger estimates that several thousands of schools are using Anton in Germany. He would welcome a scientific assessment of the app, especially since it was funded by the state, and says that studies and research are being planned.Developers reject criticism\"We are getting much more positive than negative feedback,\" Hoermeyer says. An what is more, if teachers or parents don't like the games, they can easily switch them off.\"Some parents report that their children are very motivated when learning with the app. If we had received a lot of negative feedback, we would have already updated the games section,\" Hoermeyer says.Teachers also have a good overview and can assess whether the games are a distraction or a motivation, Hoermeyer is convinced. A teacher in Neukoelln, meanwhile, has nothing against it: \"The reward system with the computer game is surely motivating.\"\"We expect that there will be less digital learning when schools open again,\" Hoermeyer says. He also does not believe that sitting in front of the computer all day is the right approach.\"We are not doing this to replace school, but provide a useful supplement to what it the greatest asset of school, and that's the personal contact between pupils and teachers,\" he says.The mother from Berlin can confirm this experience. Since the beginning of lessons after lockdown, the situation at her home has relaxed and there are no more discussions about computer games.\"After two months without Anton, and with alternating (in-person and at-home) lessons, he is not asking about the games anymore.\" — dpa\n",

      "MONTREAL: Pornhub has been increasingly under the gun as the adult video site was sued this week by 34 women who say they appeared without consent in footage showing rape, sexual abuse, revenge porn or images of them when they were minors.“This is a case about rape, not pornography,” the plaintiffs said in the statement of claim, describing the website as “likely the largest non-regulatory repository of child pornography in North America and well beyond”.Their lawyers accuse MindGeek, the controversial adult entertainment empire that runs Pornhub, of being a “classic criminal enterprise” with a business model based on exploiting non-consensual sexual content.According to the suit, which was filed in California, MindGeek owns more than 100 pornographic sites, including Pornhub, RedTube, Tube8 and YouPorn, and sees some 3.5 billion visits each month.“I’m hoping (the lawsuit) will motivate Pornhub, and then also the other companies in this industry, to put in safety measures so that this doesn’t happen to anybody else,” one of the plaintiffs, who identified herself as Rachel, told AFP on Friday.The 38-year-old Canadian, who spoke on condition that her real name not be used, recently recounted to AFP her years-long struggle to have removed from the Internet a video of her being sexually assaulted by her own husband as she lay unconscious, and later posted to Pornhub without her consent.Although Pornhub took the video down, it had already spread to countless other sites.‘Monumental day’“Today is a monumental day,” commented Laila Mickelwait of the Traffickinghub campaign to shut down Pornhub and hold its executive accountable, backed by 2.2 million people who signed an online petition.“This lawsuit makes it clear that Pornhub and its parent company Mindgeek are not just a tech company that makes a (content) moderation mistakes,” the sex trafficking expert said in a video message on Twitter.The porn giant has faced a growing backlash since the New York Times published an article in December 2020 in which Pornhub was accused of posting illegal content online, including child pornography and rape videos – which it has denied.“Why does Canada host a company that inflicts rape videos on the world?,” said its author Nicholas Kristof, noting that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau self-identifies as a feminist.The public outcry led Canadian lawmakers in February to grill MindGeek executives about alleged abuses, while Mastercard and Visa suspended payments on Pornhub. The two payments processing companies are also named in the suit, accused of having “knowingly” profiting from trafficking in providing merchant services to MindGeek.On Thursday, a Canadian parliamentary committee released 14 recommendations for regulating online platforms – including requiring them to verify the age and consent of all persons depicted in porn videos – while the Trudeau administration works on a new law that would force sites to swiftly remove illegal content.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police is also reviewing a call by victims of sexual exploitation backed by more than 70 Canadian lawmakers for a criminal investigation of Mindgeek.In recent months, Pornhub has announced a series of measures to combat illegal content, including allowing only users whose identity has been verified to upload content, and using artificial intelligence to help detect illegal videos.On Thursday, Montreal-based MindGeek described the suit’s accusation that it is running a “criminal enterprise” as “utterly absurd, completely reckless and categorically false”, according to US media. – AFP\n",

      "LOS ANGELES: Nearly three dozen women have filed a lawsuit in California against adult video website Pornhub, accusing it and its parent company of knowingly profiting from footage depicting rape and sexual exploitation, including of minors.Lawyers representing the 34 plaintiffs accuse the online giant – one of the world’s largest adult video websites – of creating a teeming marketplace for child pornography and “every other form” of nonconsensual sexual content, and want the company to pay damages.They accuse MindGeek, the controversial adult entertainment empire that runs Pornhub, of being a “classic criminal enterprise” with a business model based on exploiting non-consensual sexual content.“This is a case about rape, not pornography,” the complaint said, describing the website as “likely the largest non-regulatory repository of child pornography in North America and well beyond”.All but one of the plaintiffs, who reside both in the United States and abroad, wished to remain anonymous.Fourteen said they were minors when they were filmed and should be considered “a victim of child sex trafficking”.Michael Bowe, a lawyer representing the women, told CBS News the court could order MindGeek to pay hundreds of millions to his clients.Serena Fleites, the only plaintiff to be named, said that in 2014 she learned that “a nude, sexually explicit video” that her boyfriend had coerced her to make when she was only 13 years old had been uploaded to Pornhub without her consent.The video remained online until the teen, posing as her mother, asked Pornhub to remove it.Yet the video was not taken down for several weeks, the lawsuit said, and during that time it was downloaded and reuploaded by several different users, with each video requiring a fresh request to remove it.The plaintiffs’ lawyers accuse MindGeek of operating a “gaslighting campaign” online in a bid to discredit the victims, as well as making “threats of physical violence and death” against them.They are also suing Visa Inc – one of the world’s largest payments processing companies – for “knowingly” profiting from trafficking in providing merchant services to MindGeek.Both Visa and Mastercard suspended processing payments for Pornhub in December, after a New York Times article accused the site of hosting illegal content, including child pornography and rape videos.According to the suit, MindGeek owns more than 100 pornographic sites, including Pornhub, RedTube, Tube8 and YouPorn, and sees some 3.5 billion visits each month.Montreal-based MindGeek described the suit’s accusation that it is running a “criminal enterprise” as “utterly absurd, completely reckless and categorically false”, according to US media.Pornhub, which claims 130 million visitors a day, has denied allegations of trafficking and announced a series of measures to combat illegal content. – AFP\n",

      "WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world. A user base of over two billion is a testament to this claim.Now, WhatsApp offers many features to its users that are aimed at making chats on its platform simpler and swifter. For instance, users can make their messages disappear after a specified period of time. Similarly, another feature called playback speed, enables users to listen to audio messages at a greater speed. The list goes on and on and on. But one thing that users CAN’T do is schedule WhatsApp messages.Sadly, such a feature is not in the making at WhatsApp. None of the reports so far have hinted about such a feature being in the works either. Fortunately, there is a way around it, but you’ve got to do something. You have to take the help of third-parties and this is not always a good thing and is not normally recommended.A number of third-party apps give WhatsApp users the ability to schedule their messages. In case you are looking for such a solution, here’s your way out:How to schedule messages on Whatsapp:Step 1: Open Google Play Store on your Android smartphone.Step 2: Download and install SKEDit on your smartphone.Step 3: Open SKEDit and sign in.Step 4: Now tap on the WhatsApp option in the main menu.Step 5: Now you have to grant it permissions. Tap on Enable Accessibility option, then tap on SKEDit option. Now, toggle the Use Service button and tap on Allow button.Step 6: Back to the app, select the recipient, add your message, set scheduled date and time.Step 7: Toggle the ‘Ask me before sending’ button on.Step 8: Tap on the tick icon and your message will be scheduled.Step 9: When the scheduled time arrives, the app will send you a notification asking you to complete the action. You can tap on the Send button to send the message. You can also edit it before sending it.And, hey presto, you just learnt how to schedule messages on WhatsApp. – Hindustan Times, New Delhi/Tribune News Service\n",

      "Ikea and Sonos are taking their collaboration to the next level with a new loudspeaker made to hide in plain sight in your living room: The Symfonisk WiFi speaker looks just like a piece of art you can hang on your wall.The interior design giant and sound specialist company are selling the speaker with two art motifs on a removable front. The range of panels, which cost €30 (RM147), is to be expanded over time, says Ikea manager Stjepan Begic.For now, anyone who wants their walls to be alive with the sound of music also needs to share Ikea's taste in art.The picture's hidden purpose becomes clear once you see the power cable running from the bottom of it, something that is tricky to hide when hanging the frame from a wall.The speakers themselves cost €179 (RM882) and are set to go on sale on July 15. Despite being just 6cm thick, they have enough volume for powerful sound, promises Sonos manager Chris Davies.The picture speakers can be controlled via the Sonos app and also support Apple's Airplay 2 transmission technology. Two frames can also be connected to form a stereo pair.One power outlet is sufficient because the speakers also have a power output for the second device. The concept is best suited for small living rooms says Begic. – dpa\n",

      "No other major social media network has weathered as many scandals and shrugged off as much criticism. Even as Facebook's active user base starts to decline in some countries, is this giant just too big to fail?There are more than 2.5 billion Facebook users worldwide, making it by far the largest social media platform online today.But swamped by fake news and annoying posts, some users, especially younger ones, are turning away from Facebook, migrating to other platforms such as Instagram – a Facebook subsidiary – or TikTok, leaving behind an older user base. Even if they still maintain a profile, fewer of these users are logging in and using it actively.So why do some people stay on Facebook and others go? What inspires them to log in these days? Journalist Daniel Fiene says that if it were up to Facebook, users would have to log in to communicate with friends and family. \"However, for most users, Facebook doesn't even have that function anymore,\" as people instead communicate in a family chat on WhatsApp - another Facebook property - or Instagram.\"Many users use the platform as a way to manage contacts and to learn about events,\" explains Fiene.Facebook benefits in this respect from its large user base, which according to media trainer Teja Adams, is the network's biggest advantage over the others. Facebook is aimed at nearly all groups of users, which is why it's \"the network where you have always had the best chances of meeting friends and acquaintances,\" explains Adams.Facebook also offers the widest range of functions compared to other networks: Users can chat, post on other's walls or join a group, says Adams. One popular function is events, which allows private users and businesses and organisations to create a page where people can show their interest in attending, ask questions or learn more information.And Facebook groups in particular also continue to draw in users, says Adams. \"For every topic, no matter how specific, you can find the right group on Facebook,\" he says. And not only online, but also near where the user physically lives - allowing face-to-face contact.Facebook has added more and more basic functions to the platform in the past few years, such as gaming, live videos or the marketplace. There are a variety of different functions now within Facebook that appeal to different target groups. \"But there is no longer a function that is a unique selling point to Facebook or is wildly popular.\"There are problems in other areas as well: Several central functions no longer work as well, says Adams. Facebook's newsfeed, for example, which is actually the lifeblood of the platform, is now overwhelmed by posts from people other than friends, making it less attractive.\"But Facebook won't die so quickly,\" says Adams reassuredly. The network is too big and too deeply integrated into our daily lives.He also believes the user base will stay stable; even if new, younger users stay away, there are always potential new user groups among older folks. And the network is constantly trying to grow its bases, most recently with a whole array of brand-new audio functions.In the past, Facebook has faced criticism for its opaque default settings and misleading design in the user interface. \"Through its design, Facebook should more strongly enable users to make good decisions,\" says media researcher Matthias C Kettemann.Dark patterns – user interfaces that are intended to entice users to disclose private data or spend more time on the network than they'd like – should especially be looked at critically, says Kettemann.Facebook has made some improvements in recent years, especially in the face of legal initiatives such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. \"While privacy settings on Facebook were pretty low to start with, they are now higher by default,\" he adds. – dpa\n",

      "ANDREJ SOKOLOW\n",
      "In the wake of a major controversy over changes to user rules, WhatsApp is recommitting itself to full encryption and holding out the prospect of new features to protect user privacy.These include the possibility of sending messages that can only be viewed once by the recipient. This could be useful, for example, if you need to send a password to family members, WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart says.It will also be possible to set chats to disappear on their own after a certain time. People on the whole don't want their messages to stay forever, Cathcart argues, pointing out that we don't carry a recording device with us when we talk.The Facebook-owned company has launched an ad campaign for radio, TV and billboards aimed at improving its reputation in privacy.In the UK and Germany, key markets in Europe, short promotional videos will say that content sent on WhatsApp is only visible in plain text to the users involved, thanks to end-to-end encryption.WhatsApp has more than 2 billion users. In recent months, however, the service has had to contend with criticism and an exodus of users following the announcement of new usage rules which came into force in mid-May.The planned changes to the rules sparked outrage on social media, when many interpreted them as saying that more data would be shared with parent company Facebook.WhatsApp rejected this as a misunderstanding and repeatedly stressed that the end-to-end encryption, with which the service itself also has no access to content, would not be changed.However the damage control could not stop users switching to other messaging apps, and rivals like Telegram and Signal noted record user sign-ups in the wake of the scandal.Many users meanwhile became more aware that WhatsApp collects information about how they use their phone and where they are — information that could be used to let its parent company Facebook create a better picture of them for advertising.WhatsApp chief Cathcart acknowledges mistakes were made in announcing the new rules. \"We need to communicate clearly what we are doing and why,\" he says, admitting that WhatsApp only became clearer once \"the confusion\" took place. \"That's on us.\"He says WhatsApp had planned an advertising campaign for end-to-end encryption before the recent backlash, but after the controversy in recent months, WhatsApp has even more reason to talk about it.In the meantime, an overwhelming majority of users who had already been asked for their consent to the new rules had accepted them, Cathcart says.He did not give exact figures. Originally, users who did not agree to the new rules were supposed to lose access to basic functions over time. In the meantime, they no longer face any consequences.Only the new functions for communicating with companies can be used after agreeing to the update. According to WhatsApp, they were the central reason for the change in the terms of use.Cathcart criticises that some governments have been trying to soften encryption in chat services, and hopes over time governments will realise that the most important role they can play is to provide more security by standards for businesses.WhatsApp argues to governments that end-to-end encryption helps protect citizens' security. Facebook remains committed to its plan to bring full encryption to its second chat service, Messenger, as the next step, Cathcart said.In several countries, attempts are underway by governments and authorities to undermine full encryption in chat services such as WhatsApp, while government bodies in many countries are able to monitor traditional SMS messages.Government security officials meanwhile say that locking them out of all online communications prevents them from monitoring the activities of criminals and extremists.Recently, however, international police authorities succeeded in striking a major blow against organised crime with the help of a chat app, of all things, after investigators succeeded in establishing their allegedly secure app as a communication channel in criminal circles. – dpa\n",

      "Several electric auto startups that raised large sums from investors in the wake of Tesla's ascent are hitting potholes as they pursue next-generation vehicles.The most recent crisis occurred at Lordstown Motors, which announced Monday the sudden departure of two top executives after warning last week it needed more capital to keep operating.Company officials plan a series of events dubbed \"Lordstown Week\" later this month to shore up investor support.But local government officials are not sure what to make of the company, which had discussed adding more than 2,000 jobs in a region plagued by plant closures.\"Am I confident? Not as much as I was a week ago,\" Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill said earlier this week. \"We're waiting and seeing what the next step is.\"There have been similar leadership shakeups in at least two other electric auto companies that recently went public, raising questions about the transactions and underscoring the difficulties startups face in competing in the capital-intensive industry.\"It's definitely more challenging for a small company,\" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds.com, pointing to heavy spending needed to build and maintain factories and obtain key components.\"It does seem like Tesla is an overnight success story, which is not really the case,\" she told AFP. \"But they came in and disrupted the space amongst automotive companies that have been around for decades. Everyone wants to believe that the dream could happen.\"Lordstown's woes come in the wake of significant electric vehicle (EV) announcements since the November US presidential election from Ford, General Motors and other auto giants, intensifying competition.Rising costsLordstown Motors was launched by Steve Burns in November 2019 after the acquisition of a recently-shuttered Ohio auto plant owned by GM.The company raised US$675mil (RM2.79bil) following an October 2020 merger with DiamondPeak Holdings, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) — essentially a shell company set up to merge with an operating business.Lordstown Motors unveiled its flagship \"Endurance\" all-electric pickup truck in June 2020 when then-vice president Mike Pence visited its Ohio factory, nearly a year before Ford would present its all-electric F-150 pickup.Lordstown's share price topped US$30 (RM124.28) in February of this year, but the company's fortunes began shifting in March, when short-selling firm Hindenburg Research released a damning report that called Lordstown a \"mirage.\"On Monday, Lordstown announced the resignation of Burns and Chief Financial Officer Julio Rodriguez after an investigation concluded Hindenburg's appraisal was \"in significant respects, false and misleading,\" while acknowledging that some of its own statements about vehicle pre-orders were \"in certain respects, inaccurate.\"That followed Lordstown's June 8 disclosure that it lacks sufficient capital to begin commercial production, and warned about its ability to keep operating.The company's capital spending had swelled in part from \"stress that the Covid-19 pandemic has put on the global automotive supply chain,\" according to a securities filing.Lordstown shares tumbled after Monday's leadership shakeup, but rallied Tuesday after its executives reaffirmed plans during a Detroit event to begin production in September, pointing to \"firm\" orders from clients, according to news reports.In a securities filing Thursday, Lordstown clarified some of those remarks, saying that purchase agreements \"provide us with a significant indicator of demand\" but \"do not represent binding purchase orders.\"Unfair advantage?Lordstown is hardly the only EV prospect to stumble after going public through a SPAC. These types of transactions — which allow companies to enter markets more quickly than with a traditional initial public offering (IPO) — have soared over the last year.Usha Rodrigues, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, has described SPACs as a \"Vegas wedding IPO\" because a legal loophole gives them protection from lawsuits if their forecasts are not met — which traditional IPOs do not enjoy.EV startups that benefited from SPACs now appear prone to turbulence. Nikola suffered its own crisis last fall when its founder suddenly resigned following fraud allegations.The CEO and co-founder of Canoo resigned in April, while Lucid Motors in February delayed production of its EV sedan days after announcing a transaction valuing the company at US$11.75bil (RM48.67bil).Going public through a SPAC may have resulted in some companies getting funds \"before they deserved it,\" Karl Brauer at Carexpert.com said. \"While there's nothing wrong with the SPAC process itself, if it leads to premature funding of a company, it's more likely the company will fail.\"Brauer noted that Tesla needed 15 years to become profitable, adding \"this is a long, dedicated process, one you can't short cut with a quick infusion of cash.\" – AFP\n",

      "Parking in a tight space can get really stressful. As you manoeuvre and strain your neck to see through the rear window, impatient drivers back up behind you and honk their horns. Wouldn't it all be easier if you had a camera to help?In many new cars, even small and inexpensive ones, they now come as standard, and others offer them as optional extras. They are positioned near the number plate and automatically turn on when you engage the reverse gear.In vans and motorhomes — vehicles whose rear end position is often a matter of guesswork — cameras are often mounted at the back of the roof. Cameras as assistance systems can not only help with parking but also manoeuvring with trailers.The advantages are not only simple and safe handling, especially for large and confusing vehicles, but also increased safety, says the Robert Nitsche, an electronics expert from Germany. \"With cameras, car drivers can see the parking space exactly,\" he says, \"and they can also see children, animals and any other obstacles.\"Quite simply, they make parking much easier, says Michael Zeitler, an automotive electronics specialist, and they're easy to fit on most cars — usually on the handle of the boot or on the number plate bracket.\"If the entertainment system can process video signals and has a monitor, only the camera needs to be retro-fitted,\" says Zeitler. \"In mobile homes with a large cockpit, there's also room for an additional monitor.\"Older vehicles will require a double DIN radio with a screen, or a new rear-view mirror with an integrated monitor for the rear-view camera.Systems that transmit by wireless are cheap — roughly 100 euros (RM493.35) — but the experts say cable-based systems are better. \"Radio links are susceptible to interference and interference, break-up and frozen images,\" warns Michael Zeitler. This is because the cameras transmit their signals via a frequency that very commonly used in cities.Cable-based cameras with a compatible multimedia input and a monitor cost two to three times more.If the multimedia interface is missing, you'll need to spend more — around 450-600 euros (RM2,220-RM2,960) in Europe — for a special video adapter. An interior mirror with monitor and camera will set you back around 650 euros (RM3,206) in Europe. Labour is not included in those prices.But it's worth it, according to car tester Bernd Volkens from the German motor magazine Auto Bild. \"In contrast to acoustic parking aids — parking beeps — drivers with reversing cameras can see to the centimetre where they can drive to,\" he says. \"It really makes parking stress-free.\"Audio warnings, on the other hand, stop the driver at a safety margin of up to 40 centimetres. This means drivers are often wasting space when manoeuvring.In his opinion, the simplest retro-fitting option is a camera at the rear, which transmits via Bluetooth to a smartphone or entertainment system. But here, too, you'll need to keep an eye on the susceptibility to radio interference, and there may also be a delay on the video images.For old vehicles without a double DIN slot, the only solution is a separate, permanently installed additional monitor, says Volkens. \"The camera is simply coupled to the reversing light so that it knows when reverse gear is engaged.\"If you know what you are doing, you could fit one yourself in about three hours. But you should be aware that the system can cause problems if the reversing camera diverts power from the reverse light.\"Anyone who isn't familiar with vehicle wiring should consult a specialist,\" Volkens says. This brings the added advantage of warranty, should things go wrong with the equipment. – dpa\n",

      "Qualcomm has been working for years to get its mobile technology into other products besides smartphones — think drones, laptops and smart security cameras.Those efforts to connect the unconnected — generally called the Internet of Things — have recently started to deliver consequential financial results for Qualcomm, with revenue topping US$1bil (RM4.14bil) in each of the past two quarters.To help keep the momentum going, San Diego's largest publicly traded company rolled out a suite of seven new Internet of Things chips this week. They range from entry-level to premium tier semiconductors.Features include baked-in artificial intelligence and security, power-efficient computing, precise location capabilities and fast Wi-Fi 6, 5G and LTE connectivity, depending on the chip.\"Within the Internet of Things ecosystem, there are a variety of segments going through digital transformation, whether its retail or warehouse management or the shipping industry,\" said Nagaraju Naik, Qualcomm senior director of product management.\"Collaboration is yet another significant segment. These products that we're introducing are going to enable a lot of those applications.\"Qualcomm supplies more than 13,000 Internet of Things customers today. The company expects to add another US$1.3bil (RM4.14bil) in IoT sales in the current quarter.Even so, the bulk of Qualcomm revenue still comes from smartphones — a maturing industry that is consolidating behind a handful of dominant brands such as Samsung and Apple.Samsung already makes its own cellular processors for some of its phones, and Apple is working to design its own cellular chips, too, potentially ditching Qualcomm chips from iPhones.Hence the push to diversify. While the Internet of Things market was growing before Covid-19 lockdowns, the pandemic accelerated adoption, said Naik. Video collaboration led the way with remote work, online school and telehealth appointments.Mobile technology fits right into video collaboration, said Naik. Qualcomm's new top tier Internet of Things chip delivers the processing heft to manage multiple cameras, stream high-resolution video and provide noise-cancelling audio, as well as power artificial intelligence algorithms for things like facial tracking or background blurring.Retail tech is another sector ripe for digital transformation, said Naik. Emerging technologies include smart carts that analyze items, deliver digital coupons and enable just-walk-out shopping.\"Smart cart is actually bringing the point-of-sale experience or the checkout experience into the cart,\" said Naik. \"So, you have cameras that can detect what (merchandise) is being picked by the consumer, and then right on the cart you have point-of-sale ability.\"Warehouse management and package shipping also are innovating with digital technology, as are smart cities, smart health care and smart factories. As part of the chip rollout, Qualcomm is offering extended hardware and software support for IoT devices for a minimum of eight years.\"Qualcomm Technologies is uniquely positioned to lead the IoT ecosystem forward with our systems-level approach,\" said Jeff Lorbeck, senior vice president and general manager of connected smart systems at Qualcomm.\"We believe in the power of technology to enrich lives through purposeful innovation with solutions to support the ecosystem in reimagining how the world connects, works and communicates. These new IoT solutions are a step towards achieving that goal.\" – dpa\n",

      "LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) -Police in India have summoned Twitter's top official in the country to answer allegations that the U.S. firm failed to stop the spread of a video that allegedly incited \"hate and enmity\" between Hindu and Muslim communities.An official police notice, seen by Reuters, showed a case had been registered in Ghaziabad in northern Uttar Pradesh state over a video of a few men, apparently Hindu, beating an elderly man believed to be a Muslim and cutting his beard.The police report names Twitter Inc, its local unit and seven others for their alleged roles in disseminating a video that was deemed insulting to religious beliefs and causing public mischief in a state with a long, bloody history of communal violence.The controversy comes just as India's federal government is locking horns with Twitter over non-compliance with new IT rules, which have raised doubts whether the platform would continue to enjoy protection against legal liability for user-generated content. The new rules became effective in late May.In a notice dated Thursday, Ghaziabad police wrote to Twitter India head Manish Maheshwari to appear before officials within seven days of the receipt of the summons.\"Some people used their Twitter handles to spread hatred and enmity in the society and Twitter did not take cognisance,\" said the notice, which was reviewed by Reuters.\"Writings and works which promoted enmity and affected harmony between different communities in the country and the state were encouraged and such anti-society messages were allowed to go viral.\"Twitter declined to comment, and Maheshwari did not respond to a request for comment.IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad lashed out at Twitter this week for the Ghaziabad incident, saying its failure to act was \"perplexing.\"NO SAFE HARBOURPrasad has said Twitter has not complied with a new set of government rules that required them to appoint new compliance officers by May 26.The rules state that in case of non-compliance, protection that companies enjoy related to any liability against user generated content \"shall not be applicable\" and companies \"shall be liable for punishment under any law.\"\"The moment Twitter was non-complaint, the safe harbour protection was automatically not available,\" said Shlok Chandra, a New Delhi-based lawyer who represents the federal government in various cases. \"The position is very clear.\"Some free speech activists and lawyers, however, disagree.\"The Central Government neither has the power to bestow, nor the power to \"withdraw\" the exemption from liability...The determination of the question whether Twitter is entitled to seek exemption from liability is solely within the domain of the Courts,\" Delhi-based Ira Law firm said in a LinkedIn post this month.Three special rapporteurs appointed by a top United Nations human rights body last week urged India to review the new IT rules, saying their broadened scope did not conform with international human rights norms and could threaten digital rights.To comply with India's new IT rules, companies such as Twitter needed to appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal officer and a resident grievance officer. But LinkedIn job postings show all three positions were currently open at Twitter.The social media giant has however retained an interim chief compliance officer, it said this week, adding that it was making all efforts to adhere to the new IT rules.(Reporting by Saurabh Sharma in LUCKNOW and Sankalp Phartiyal in NEW DELHI; Editing by Aditya Kalra, Raju Gopalakrishnan & Simon Cameron-Moore)\n",

      "SINGAPORE: DBS Bank customers have flagged a glitch in the lender’s banking services, with several of them saying that they were charged twice for transactions made on credit and debit cards.The bank said on Friday (June 18) that it is aware of duplicate transactions on selected cards and is investigating to make refunds.“We are identifying and fixing the issue. Please be assured that any duplicated transactions will be refunded,” DBS, Singapore’s largest bank, said in a Facebook post.“We apologise for the inconvenience caused and seek your understanding,” it added.Many users said they were unable to log in to their accounts through the app or Internet banking portal.One message said: “We are experiencing heavy traffic to our services. You will be redirected shortly. Alternatively, please log in later.”One of the customers affected by the duplicate deductions is housewife Asyura Irfan.The 37-year-old told The Straits Times that she was charged Sg$11.70 (RM36.13) twice for a transaction made on Grab on Monday, while her husband similarly had Sg$29 (RM89.55) deducted twice from his account for a Giant supermarket purchase on Tuesday. They are both using POSB debit cards.Her mother was also charged Sg$54 (RM166.75) twice for a purchase on booking platform Klook using a POSB debit card, she added. The amount for the purchase on Tuesday was deducted on Thursday, but another deduction was made on Friday for the same purchase.“As of now, I am unable to login to the POSB app,” said Asyura on Friday morning.Several customers said on DBS’ Facebook page that they were also unable to get through to the bank’s customer service hotline.Some asked if the refunds will be automatically credited back to their accounts or if they need to apply for them.Facebook user Leo Nardo Tan urged the bank to investigate the glitch urgently: “I have at least two duplicate transactions that I was aware (of). Need to check through more past transactions.”Brandon Lee, one of those who managed to contact the bank, wrote: “The customer officer told me to request for a callback once they find out the cause in three working days.”The Straits Times has contacted DBS for more information on the glitch. – The Straits Times (Singapore)/Asia News Network\n",

      "China’s government summoned Meituan’s Wang Xing to a meeting recently and warned him to keep a low profile, after the founder of China’s third-largest tech corporation last month posted a controversial poem that convulsed markets and sparked a social media furor.Beijing officials called Wang in after the food delivery mogul posted a millennium-old poem regarded by many as implicit criticism of the government, according to people with knowledge of the matter. They warned him to refrain from courting the spotlight, at least temporarily, the people said, asking not to be identified as they weren’t authorised to discuss the matter.The Tang Dynasty poem – describing the burning of books under China’s first emperor – was widely seen as anti-establishment and triggered a US$26bil (RM107.75bil) selloff in Meituan’s shares over two days. While the CEO later issued a clarification saying his post had been targeted at the short-sightedness of his own industry, some investors drew parallels to the criticisms issued by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd founder Jack Ma against regulators last year, which triggered an unprecedented crackdown on China’s Internet sector. The officials however indicated to Wang that no further fallout will result from the incident, the people said.Meituan didn’t respond to a written request for comment. Like Alibaba previously, Meituan is grappling with a probe by the state antitrust watchdog into alleged monopolistic behaviour such as merchant exclusivity, which some analysts have estimated could result in fines of over US$700mil (RM2.90bil).Officials refrained from taking more severe action against Wang because they didn’t want to convey the impression that every minor transgression could result in dire consequences, one of the people said. The incident transpired less than two months before the Chinese Communist Party is poised to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding on July 1, a politically sensitive period in the country.The entrepreneur has since stayed under the radar. Since Wang posted the statement clarifying his intentions on May 9, he’s abruptly stopped posting to his account on Fanfou, the social media platform he created before Meituan. Prior to the controversy, he updated his account at least several times a week.The billionaire hasn’t been seen nor heard in public beyond a brief appearance on Meituan’s quarterly earnings call in May. His donation of a US$2.3bil (RM9.53bil) stake in the food delivery giant to charity – one of the largest single acts of philanthropy during the pandemic – was revealed through a company disclosure statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, in lieu of a personal announcement.Beijing is now focusing its efforts on a broader investigation, announced in April, into whether Meituan violated anti-monopoly laws through practices such as forced exclusivity arrangements. Meituan executives said last month it’s set up a dedicated team to work with officials conducting the probe, and vowed strict compliance with new guidelines.Wang’s fate contrasts with that of Alibaba’s Ma, whose business empire came under sustained assault from regulators. His fintech giant Ant Group Co was forced to scrap what would have been a record initial public offering, while Alibaba was slapped with a US$2.8bil (RM11.60bil) fine for antitrust violations, the largest such penalty ever.Ma is also under pressure to divest some of his media holdings, people familiar with the matter have said, and the flamboyant businessman hasn’t been seen in public beyond a handful of low-key appearances. – Bloomberg\n",

      "LONDON: Google announced on June 16 a series of new features to be added to its Android phone system, most notably end-to-end encryption for messaging.In contrast to Apple’s iMessage system which had the end-to-end encryption for years, Google only developed the feature in November, and it is now being rolled-out to devices with access to rich communication services (RCS).The feature will only be active provided that both users have it turned on, are connected to WiFi or mobile data, and have RCS enabled under chat settings. Otherwise, the advanced chat features on Android will revert back onto regular short message service (SMS) messaging.Users will be able to know the feature is turned on because the send icon will have a small padlock on it.In a statement, Google said: “No matter who you're messaging with, the information you share is personal. End-to-end encryption in Messages helps keep your conversations more secure while sending.”Other new Android features include enabling users to star messages in the Google app, to find them more quickly in future, contextual emoji suggestions, Google Assistant updates, and Android Auto updates for cars.Google’s earthquake-alerts feature, initially introduced in New Zealand and Greece, was also being extended to Turkey, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. – Arab News, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia/Tribune News Service\n",

      "PLYMOUTH, England: The Mayflower had a few false starts before its trailblazing sea voyage to America more than 400 years ago. Now, its artificial intelligence-powered namesake is having some glitches of its own.A sleek robotic trimaran retracing the 1620 journey of the famous English vessel had to turn back on June 18 to fix a mechanical problem.Nonprofit marine research organisation ProMare, which worked with IBM to build the autonomous ship, said it made the decision to return to base “to investigate and fix a minor mechanical issue” but hopes to be back on the trans-Atlantic journey as soon as possible.With no humans on board the ship, there’s no one to make repairs while it’s at sea.Piloted by artificial intelligence technology, the 50-foot (15-meter) Mayflower Autonomous Ship began its trip early Tuesday, departing from Plymouth, England, and spending some time off the Isles of Scilly before it headed for deeper waters.It was supposed to take up to three weeks to reach Provincetown on Cape Cod before making its way to Plymouth, Massachusetts. If successful, it would be the largest autonomous vessel to cross the Atlantic.There is some historical precedent for the malfunction: The original Mayflower that carried Pilgrim settlers to New England was supposed to set sail in the summer of 1620 but twice turned back to England because of a leaking problem affecting its sister ship, the Speedwell. – AP\n",

      "SYDNEY: Major banks and airlines were among businesses hit by a fresh global online outage on June 17, with the problem traced to US-based tech provider Akamai.An hour-long blackout hit a number of US airlines and several Australian financial firms as well as other companies dotted around the world, with angry customers unable to access websites and mobile apps.“We are aware of the issue and actively working to restore services as soon as possible,” an Akamai spokesperson told AFP.American, Delta, United and Southwest airlines were among those affected, while the issue appeared to be more prolonged in Australia – where problems struck mid-afternoon as much of the world slept.Australia’s largest financial firm Commonwealth Bank told AFP that it and many of the country’s major lenders had been hit.The outages, which began around 2.10pm Sydney time (0510 GMT), also hit Australia’s postal service and Virgin Australia.The airline said in a statement that it “was one of many organisations to experience an outage with the Akamai content delivery system”.A spokesperson for ANZ bank told AFP the incident was “related to an external provider” but that “connectivity was restored quickly and the most impacted services are back online”.Banks in New Zealand and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange also reported problems with their web platforms.It is the latest incident to draw attention to the stability of economically vital online platforms and the key role that a handful of mostly unknown companies play in keeping the web running.Last week US media and government websites, including the White House, New York Times, Reddit and Amazon were temporarily hit after a glitch with cloud computing services provider Fastly.Fastly offers a service to websites around the world to speed up loading times for websites.Akamai offers a range of similar IT products designed to boost online performance and security.The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company refused to comment on what product the problem came from, but one of the affected firms reported it used Akamai for “IT network authentication”.Among the services Akamai provides are platforms that prevent DDoS attacks – an often crude cyberattack that knocks websites out by peppering them with requests for data.“Our priority is restoring service as quickly as possible. We will share additional information as it becomes available,” an Akamai spokesperson said.A series of high-profile hack-for-ransom attacks have also left corporations around the world jittery over cybersecurity risks, although there was no indication the latest problems were caused by malicious actors.Colonial Pipeline was briefly shuttered after an attack in May, and JBS, the world’s largest meat producer, was forced to stop operations in the United States and Australia.Both firms reportedly paid ransoms to get operations back up and running.The issue of cybersecurity was at the top of the agenda when US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin met in Geneva on Wednesday.Washington believes hackers who have extorted hundreds of millions of dollars from Western governments, companies, and organisations operate from Russian soil. – AFP\n",

      "Astronauts Thomas Pesquet of France and Shane Kimbrough of the United States spacewalked outside the International Space Station on Wednesday as they began the painstaking process of installing new solar panels to boost the orbital outpost's deteriorating power systems.It was the first of several excursions to augment the ISS's existing eight solar arrays, with the first pair operating continuously since December 2000.The spacewalking duo were installing the first of six new rollout panels — but problems with display and controls on Kimbrough's spacesuit forced him to return to the station to reset his systems.The time lost meant they were only able to maneuver the panel into position, but unable to install the cabling and bolts needed to complete the process during Wednesday's spacewalk of seven hours and 15 minutes.They might pick up the work Sunday, but the final plan is being worked out.The spacewalks \"are going to be very challenging, very complex, so we've got to make sure that we're both on the same page for every movement that we do,\" Kimbrough said ahead of leaving the airlock Wednesday morning.Part of the installation procedure has to be carried out while the ISS is in the Earth's shadow, when the station is operating on battery power.The combination of the original arrays and six newer and smaller arrays that are more efficient will boost power by 20-30%.\"Together in combination they generate more power than what our original array when it was new did on its own,\" Dana Weigel, deputy manager of the International Space Station program said.When the mission is complete, the ISS will be back to operating at 215 kilowatts. For comparison, a desktop computer and monitor runs at around 270 watts, and a small refrigerator uses about 725 watts.The new arrays can be rolled out like yoga mats and are smaller and lighter than traditional solar panels.NASA hopes to move forward with the technology for the Artemis mission to return to the Moon, and similar panels will likely be used on a future lunar station called Gateway.It was Pesquet's third spacewalk and Kimbrough's seventh. – AFP\n",

Providing protection against covid-19 and other viruses, this face mask stands out from other options with its futuristic look, not to mention its built-in microphones and light effects.This mask is adjustable, and features a silicone guard around the nose and chin. The wearer's face is visible, and there are two ventilation zones around the mouth to filter air. The mask uses replaceable N95 filters that offer protection against approximately 95% of airborne particles. On average, each of these filters lasts three times longer than a conventional disposable surgical mask. This results in an 80% reduction in waste.The mask will have an interior light, in addition to the exterior LEDs, so that the wearer's face is always visible, even in the dark. Plus, thanks to its integrated microphones and amplifiers, it makes sure the wearer can be heard, even when masked-up. It also incorporates an active air cooling and regulation system.When not in use, the mask can be stored in its case, where, as well as being recharged, it will be sterilised of all impurities and bacteria by ultraviolet light.Despite announcing its upcoming release, Razer has not yet given any information about the mask’s price.While waiting to try it out for real, a special filter available via Razer's Instagram page is on hand to let prospective buyers see how they look with this mask on their faces. – AFP Relaxnews\n",

US-led negotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear programme have been stalled since 2019.A Kaeri official said the institute reported the intrusion to the government after discovering it on May 31, and an investigation was being carried out.An official at the science and technology ministry, which is leading the investigation, said it had not found evidence to determine that North Korea was behind the hack.Simon Choi, head of IssueMakersLab, said Kimsuky had long been seeking access to South Korean government and legislative agencies and educational institutes.“We’ve been tracing their activity and such attempts happen on a daily basis,” Choi told Reuters.“But this case caught our attention given the sensitivity of the think tank’s work.”South Korea has accused the North of a string of cyberattacks, including on multiple banks in 2011, a state-run nuclear reactor operator in 2015 and the defence ministry in 2016.In November, South Korean lawmakers said the intelligence agency had foiled North Korean attempts to hack into companies developing coronavirus vaccines. – Reuters\n",

      "SAN DIEGO, California: A team of San Diego scientists is harnessing artificial intelligence to understand why Covid-19 symptoms can vary dramatically from one person to the next – information that could prove useful in the continued fight against the coronavirus and future pandemics.Researchers pored through publicly available data to see how other viruses alter which genes our cells turn on or off. Using that information, they found a set of genes activated across a wide range of infections, including the novel coronavirus. Those genes predicted whether someone would have a mild or a severe case of Covid-19, and whether they were likely to have a lengthy hospital stay.A University of California, San Diego-led team joined by researchers at Scripps Research and the La Jolla Institute for Immunology published the findings June 11. The study’s authors say their approach could help determine whether new treatments and vaccines are working.“When the whole world faced this pandemic, it took several months for people to scramble” to understand the new virus, said Dr Pradipta Ghosh, a UC San Diego cell biologist and one of the study’s authors. “I think we need more of this computational framework to guide us in panic states like this.”The project began in March 2020, when Ghosh teamed up with UC San Diego computer scientist Debashis Sahoo to better understand why the novel coronavirus was causing little to no symptoms in some people while wreaking havoc on others.There was just one problem: The novel coronavirus was, well, novel, meaning there wasn’t much data to learn from.So Sahoo and Ghosh took a different tack. They went to public databases and downloaded 45,000 samples from a wide array of viral infections, including Ebola, Zika, influenza, HIV, and hepatitis C virus, among others.Their hope was to find a shared response pattern to these viruses, and that’s exactly what they saw: 166 genes that were consistently cranked up during infection. Among that list, 20 genes generally separated patients with mild symptoms from those who became severely ill.The coronavirus was no exception. Sahoo and Ghosh say they identified this common viral response pattern well before testing it in samples from Covid-19 patients and infected cells, yet the results held up surprisingly well.“It seemed to work in every data set we used,” Sahoo said. “It was hard to believe.”They say their findings show that respiratory failure in Covid-19 patients is the result of overwhelming inflammation that damages the airways and, over time, makes immune cells less effective.Stanford’s Purvesh Khatri isn’t surprised. His lab routinely uses computer algorithms and statistics to find patterns in large sets of immune response data. In 2015, Khatri’s group found that respiratory viruses trigger a common response. And in April, they reported that this shared response applied to a range of other viruses, too, including the novel coronavirus.That makes sense, Khatri says, because researchers have long known there are certain genes the immune system turns on in response to virtually any viral infection.“Overall, the idea is pretty solid,” said Khatri of the recent UC San Diego-led study. “The genes are all (the) usual suspects.”Sahoo and Ghosh continue to test their findings in new coronavirus data as it becomes available. They’re particularly interested in Covid-19 long-haulers. Ghosh says they’re already seeing that people with prolonged coronavirus symptoms have distinct gene activation patterns compared to those who have fully recovered. Think of it like a smoldering fire that won’t die out.The researchers’ ultimate hope isn’t just to predict and understand severe disease, but to stop it. For example, they say, a doctor could give a patient a different therapy if a blood sample suggests they’re likely to get sicker with their current treatment. Ghosh adds that the gene pattern they’re seeing could help identify promising new treatments and vaccines against future pandemics based on which therapies prevent responses linked to severe disease.“In unknown, uncharted territory, this provides... guard rails for us to start looking around, understand (the virus), find solutions, build better models and, finally, find therapeutics.” – The San Diego Union-Tribune/Tribune News Service\n",

If there is an exciting verdict in the USA, it will be commented on on Twitter,\" he says.Compared to other networks, a Twitter profile is quick to set up. All you need are your name, email address, and a unique user name (your Twitter handle).You can also write something about yourself in up to 160 characters. This short biography is a tremendous help in gaining new followers, Ward says.It's important to outline who you are and what you're doing on Twitter. \"The best way to do this is to concentrate on a few key terms that define your own subject areas and interests,\" Ward says.But that alone is not enough to get attention, followers, and likes. To achieve that, you need to tweet high-quality, focussed content.Social media expert Ward says that commonplace, banal statements quickly disappear on Twitter and so getting an impact is all about posting content that can be discussed and debated.Commenting on, liking, and retweeting other people's tweets is also an important part of being effective on Twitter. The platform has other features that users should know about. One is the ability to create lists to which Twitter accounts can be assigned.“This is an excellent way to sort your own news feed,” says Ward. With the lists you can have many small, thematically sorted feeds instead of one overflowing newsfeed.And then of course there's the all-important hashtag. However, you shouldn't overdo their use. \"Studies say that tweets with more than two or three hashtags get even less attention\" rather than more, Ward says.For that reason, hashtags should only be used in a targeted manner, for example when tweeting from an event or when the hashtag adds some important context to the tweet.\"The Twitter community is fundamentally less playful, but more focussed on news and information,\" according to Ward.She believes the new Twitter format Spaces, an imitation of the social audio app Clubhouse, will become important in the long term. Here, users can have live audio conversations in groups, just like in a moderated conference call. – dpa\n",

      "IN a world gripped by a health crisis, happiness can sometimes be elusive for even the most jovial of us.That, however, was no reason for over 3,700 teachers and students from across the globe to feel discouraged as they took part in a project to make the world shine brighter.Held from January to April this year, the Humane Happiness 2021 saw 60 educators from Malaysia and their students joining their international counterparts in offering each other social-emotional support.Through activities carried out over the course of 10 weeks, the participants were given opportunities to develop constructive habits, a sense of optimism and relationship-building skills.They also experienced the joy of contributing towards a social cause, which is essential for effective understanding of global citizenship.It is hoped that the project will empower the participants to become global citizens who strive to achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and are competent in the 10 life skills laid down by the World Health Organisation.Humane Happiness South-East Asia coordinator Nirmaladevi Kandasamy found that her pupils were motivated to learn the English language during their participation.“The pupils are second language learners, so they have low self-esteem and a fear of learning English. But throughout this project, they were encouraged to listen, speak, read and write in the language,” said the teacher at SK St. Patrick, Tawau, Sabah.The international research-based collaborative project is the brainchild of Pramod Thube, an English language teacher from Maharashtra, India.It aims to instil compassion in the student fraternity and encourage everyone to explore ways to attain and spread happiness in these unusual times.\n",

      "WITH the number of Covid-19 cases still at a high, healthcare workers are overworked and burnt out.The healthcare system, is already at breaking point and Intensive Care Units (ICU) nationwide are almost full, with several of them operating over capacity, Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah warned on May 22.As the number of new cases approached 8,000 a day, he posted photos of exhausted medical frontliners – some drenched in sweat and others lying down, too tired to even take off their face masks or personal protective equipment – on his social media.To address the situation, housemen, fresh medical graduates as well as retired medical practitioners would be enlisted to help at vaccination centres, said Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba.On June 10, he said manpower would be increased by roping in housemen, who are doing their sixth stint, to administer vaccines or to monitor those who have just been vaccinated. Those who recently graduated from medical schools such as doctors, nurses and dentists, Dr Adham added, would be sent for training and issued a licence to practise before being mobilised at vaccination centres.While the move will no doubt ease the manpower shortage at vaccination centres, frontliners at government clinics and hospitals, and district health offices, are still in dire need of help.Calling on the Health Ministry to re-strategise, the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) said many frontliners are struggling to cope with the surge in Covid-19 cases.Stressing that the country cannot afford to wait for the situation to worsen, its president Prof Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said immediate steps are needed to ease the burden of medical frontliners.“The ministry should rope in housemen who are awaiting their posting, medical students, nursing students and also medical assistants with basic medical knowledge and training, to help on the ground with contact tracing.“District health officers are tasked with the daily Covid-19 management duties of triaging, screening, assessing, contact tracing, monitoring and home monitoring of Category 1 and 2 Covid-19 patients.“Apart from this, they also manage acute and chronic non-Covid-19 cases on a daily basis.“These officers feel like they are pulled in every direction and with the surge in cases, the system is on the verge of collapse.“The ministry must take a serious view of the situation and urgently address these manpower shortages, especially in the Klang Valley where cases are the highest,” Dr Subramaniam said in a statement last month.MORE STORIES ON PAGE 5\n",

      "SENIOR doctors can be directed to Covid-19 wards where more attention is required if medical students are allowed to help.This, in turn, would help medical graduates who are waiting for their posting become accustomed to the job scope. It would also enable us to carry out our duties more effectively once we start serving in hospitals.By allowing us to help now, we will learn how to work in the wards, get used to the system from the get-go and accustom ourselves to the workload of a house officer.I would be more than happy to start work in the wards immediately if given a chance to help in this pandemic.” - John Chai, 26“LOOKING at the Covid-19 situation in our country and around the world, we cannot ignore the fact that things are not rosy.The Health Ministry needs all the manpower it can get to manage the situation and what better way to do so than to rope in final year medical students and housemen? We are going to enter the medical field eventually so why not let us do so sooner?Our experience and skills will be enhanced and we can get a birds eye view on what to expect when we eventually start work at the hospitals.There may be concerns about us being exposed to the virus but we were already prepared for hazards like these the day we signed up for medical school.I think it’s good for housemen, final year medical students and trainee nurses to be included in the battle against Covid-19. Not only will we be better equipped when we go for our posting, but we can help lessen the heavy burden of our healthcare workers.”- A.Kumar, 25\n",

      "FOLLOWING in their seniors’ footsteps, a team of five students from Multimedia University (MMU) in Melaka recently scored a major highlight in their engineering endeavour.Team Grüne Welt, or “Green World” in German, came in second in the Vehicle Design Award (Prototype) category at this year’s Shell Eco-marathon Virtual Off-Track Awards for Asia and the Middle East.They were the only Malaysian team to have gained recognition at the competition, which saw a record number of 198 entries from 64 teams across 11 countries. It was nearly twice the number of submissions from previous years.The team – comprising mechanical engineering students Ng Kean Pin, Tan Jun Liang, Liou Jun Quan and Leow Tze Yi, and information technology student Ngwe Jia Le – bagged the prize of US$750 (RM3,108).In an email interview with StarEdu, the team expressed their joy over their win.“We had aimed for the Vehicle Design Award for some time, and we finally achieved it this year. Our hard work paid off,” they said in a collective statement.They added that they had been spurred on by their seniors’ “outstanding result” at Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2019 where they emerged top in Malaysia and sixth in Asia, besides bagging the Circular Economy Award.The 2021 winning team let on that they opted to compete in the Vehicle Design Award category as they were confident of their Eco-V7 battery-electric prototype vehicle fulfilling all the requirements.“It has a minimum aerodynamic drag, inspired by the shape of a shark’s profile. This reduces the wastage of battery energy while the vehicle is in motion on the track, thus making it energy-efficient.“Not just that, its drivetrain and shell-chassis connections are all in modular design, which eases the assembly and maintenance process, as the parts can be assembled and dismantled easily,” they said, adding that lightweight carbon fibre reinforced structures and a direct steering system are used to minimise the vehicle’s weight. Driven by the organisers’ nod to their prototype, the team has stepped up their vehicle fabrication process, although their effort has been met with interruptions due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Despite the hindrances, we are determined to complete the fabrication of Eco-V7 by the end of this year,” they said.The team did not forget to express their gratitude for their advisors Lim Boon Kian and Liew Kia Wai – both senior lecturers at MMU’s Faculty of Engineering and Technology who have been their pillars of support throughout their contest journey.“Fabricating and assembling Eco-V7 is not an easy task. We often encounter unexpected problems, such as mismatch of carbon fibre rod connections and misalignment of wheels,” they said, adding that they have also sought guidance from their seniors who have first-hand experience in fabricating earlier MMU Grüne Welt Eco series vehicles.When asked how they will use the cash prize, the team said they have agreed to save it for their future vehicle development and fabrication.Through their win, the team has also acquired 100 Virtual League points, propelling their ranking to 10th in the Asia Pacific region and 30th globally.The global Virtual League is the latest feature of the Shell Eco-marathon Virtual Programme, enabling teams to accrue points across a range of challenges, including the Off-Track Awards and a brand-new Autonomous Programming Competition, which all feed into an ongoing league table.In a press release, Shell Eco-marathon global general manager Norman Koch said the 2021 virtual programme is designed to recognise and reward the students’ achievements throughout the year.“From Virtual Technical Inspection to Off-Track Awards and global energy challenges like Pitch the Future, it aims to stretch and strengthen their science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills from start to finish,” he said.“While nothing can replace the excitement on the track, we hope that these virtual components will continue to provide opportunities to Shell Eco-marathon teams as we navigate these difficult times,” he added.Team Grüne Welt shared that they are actively taking part in all the virtual events held by Shell Eco-marathon.“We are in the midst of preparing for the Road to 2050 Bonus Challenge. We hope to win awards in both the Virtual Technical Inspection and the Road to 2050 competitions,” they said.Shell Eco-marathon is one of the world’s leading student engineering competitions. Over the past 35 years, the programme has brought together STEM students from across the globe to design and build energy-efficient vehicles, with the aim of shaping a lower carbon future for all.\n",

      "THERE is no time to waste in a crisis.Urging the Health Ministry to pull out all the stops to help the nation’s frontliners fight the pandemic, the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) has suggested that some 1,000 of the nation’s medical graduates still waiting for their postings be mobilised together with medical and nursing students, as well as medical assistants, with basic medical knowledge and training to help on the ground with contact tracing as soon as possible.Worried that the country’s healthcare system will crumble under the weight of the high number of Covid-19 cases, MMA president Prof Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said all available hands need to be on deck as there is an acute shortage of manpower at the district health departments and government clinics.“At a time when cases are at an all-time high, we must look at every possible avenue to enhance our healthcare system and support our medical frontliners,” he said.Speaking to StarEdu, he said there are at least more than 1,000 medical graduates waiting to be absorbed into the medical system.Last March, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba said the ministry would place housemen in public hospitals nationwide to support medical staff, in particular doctors, who have their hands full due to Covid-19.“These housemen will help ease the burden faced by doctors and specialists that focus on Covid-19, and they will also help make hospital operations run smoother.“The housemen, however, will also have to go through an induction course for five days, that includes the handling of Covid-19 elements,” he said.Final year medical students and housemen awaiting their postings, Dr Subramaniam said, can also work in non-Covid wards.This, he said, could be a win-win situation for all parties involved as it allows students to familiarise themselves with ward work, and saves time in training them in the future.“Houseman would not have to wait any longer for their placements, and with these two groups helping out in non-Covid wards, more doctors can work in the Covid wards, thus relieving their overworked colleagues.”Bringing housemen-in-waiting and students onboard, he added, would provide them with invaluable practical training.“They will, however, need to be vaccinated and there must be collaboration with the Higher Education Ministry before this can happen.“Final year medical students could assist doctors in non-Covid wards to familiarise themselves with daily hospital duties before starting housemanship,” he said, adding that medical students who have yet to be registered with the Malaysian Medical Council because of technical issues should also be asked to help out.The ministry, he said, could develop a training pathway for house officers where there is a separate unit formed for final year students to register for housemanship and be interviewed right after completing their degrees.To save on administrattive costs, these student should also be allowed to request for placements to speed up the housemanship process, he said. Consider thisThe advantages of roping in these groups, Dr Subramaniam said, are multifold.It prepares medical students for their housemanship training and can be part of their practical training, he said.“Additionally, medical graduates waiting for their posting won’t lose touch with their practical skills and while waiting, this could also serve as good revision time for them.“The idea of being a doctor includes helping people.“The chance to assist in a pandemic may never come by again. Experiences you take away from a situation like this will make you a better doctor,” he said.While some junior doctors may be overwhelmed by the long working hours and sacrifices the job entails, roping them in now can make it easier for them to adjust to the Malaysian hospital system before their housemanship posting.Dr Subramaniam, however, acknowledged that proper planning and great care is needed before students can be brought in to help in real world settings.Medicolegal, insurance, remuneration and administrative issues, which may entail additional paperwork and costs, must be thoroughly studied, he said.“Students must also be well trained, assessed and supervised to avoid any mishaps or casualties,” he said.Former MMA and the Medico-Legal Society of Malaysia president Prof Datuk Dr N.K.S. Tharmaseelan said since the Covid-19 outbreak, many have stepped up to help.A group known as the MMA Volunteer Corps, he said, sent a list of 30 senior and experienced general practitioners, retired specialists and government doctors to the ministry to volunteer their expertise and to assist the frontliners.Doctors who have been waiting for their postings for months should be quickly recruited to begin their service to the nation, he added.“There are also many housemen who, after their two years of housemanship, have had their services terminated for unexplained reasons.“These housemen could have been retained and had their services extended,” he said.But fast tracking final year medical students to become doctors by enlisting them to help the frontliners, is not something Dr Tharmaseelan, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Melaka-Manipal Medical College, is in favour of.“They have their training schedules, examinations and various other postings to consider. Covid-19 is not the only disease they need to know about.“There are numerous different cases to learn about and to treat,” he said, adding that the pandemic has placed many constraints on training and teaching.Enlisting “raw manpower” such as students, to fight Covid-19 will not ease the country’s healthcare burden nor will it be useful for the students themselves in the long run as their training would have been compromised, he added.“These students would have missed their online classes and clinical training because of the pandemic.“They still have so much to learn. Sending them out now would hinder their already compromised training.“The experienced ones are aplenty so why enlist students? We must ensure that they graduate as fully qualified doctors, not as half-baked professionals,” he said.Medical Practitioners Coalition Association of Malaysia president Dr Raj Kumar Maharajah said doctors who have graduated and are waiting for their posting should be the first ones to be absorbed into the system to assist in the non-Covid wards and patients. “There are many waiting to start work. Final year medical students need to concentrate on their final exams.“There is no hurry to absorb them into the system as they may pose a danger not only to themselves but also to the patients.“At a time when we are looking to curb the virus spread, it’s best not to have too many people walking around the hospital,” he said.Dr Raj Kumar explained that to be legally able to treat and help out in the wards, these students first need to be registered with the Malaysian Medical Council as full fledged doctors.Final year students should be asked to help only if hospitals are really shorthanded and are facing an emergency, he opined.“We have not reached that stage yet. We can revisit this idea when the time comes, if it does,” he said.\n",

      "School uses the newspaper to engage students in HIPAT a recent Highly Immersive Programme (HIP) Carnival organised by the Selangor State Education Department in SMK Raja Muda Musa, Selangor, eight schools from six districts – SK Kampung Idaman, SK Binjal, SAM Sg Haji Dorani, SMK Seksyen 4 Kota Damansara, SMK Ampang Pecah, SMK TTDI Jaya and SMK Kuala Selangor – discussed strategies taken by the school administration to achieve its goal of improving English proficiency among students.HIP, which was introduced under the Upholding Bahasa Malaysia and Strengthening English policy, aims to provide a language-rich environment for students to be exposed to the language through various activities within and beyond the classroom.Besides improving English proficiency, it also focuses on inculcating positive behaviour towards learning and using the language.SMK Kuala Selangor English panel head Faridah Kassim shares her experiences in incorporating The Star newspaper and its Newspaper-in-Education (NiE) pullout as part of the school’s Highly Immersive Programme.IN SMK Kuala Selangor, the English language department has carried out many activities under HIP. One of the programmes include our use of the newspaper known as The Star’s NiE pullout.In a quote from her book Quotes with Soul to Make You Feel Whole, Lucille Dass, Star-NiE freelance consultant trainer, states: “Your paper qualifications do not just your credentials make. You are valued mostly according to how you inter-relate and communicate.”In this quote, I believe that the key word here is “communicate”.If “on paper” a student is excellent and shows outstanding grades but is unable to communicate well, the result is not valuable because he will not be able to show for it in life. For example, should this student attend an interview, he will be unable to express his ideas well and hence miss opportunities to better himself.This is a common occurrence because most students these days cannot communicate well. This, in my opinion, is due to the lack of vocabulary in speaking English. This is why the NiE programme is so closely connected to HIP.The newspaper directs students to word exposure. If teachers use the NiE programme in their lessons, students would uncover more words and by doing so, would increase their vocabulary.As a teacher who has used the NiE pullouts in the classroom since 2016, I can vouch that The Star’s NiE programme inspires teachers to be creative in planning their activities.We have used NiE activities suggested in the pullouts and tweaked them to support all types of language-rich activities to create a highly immersive environment in the classroom.We have been fortunate because of a newspaper sponsorship from glove-making company, Hartalega.From this sponsorship, we carried out 21st century teaching and learning lessons. Here, students are divided into teams for group work. To complete tasks, they use materials from the newspaper. The final product is an opportunity to present their outcome in groups.The students in our school are quite familiar with this type of learning methodology because the activities in the Star-NiE pullouts encourage group learning and outcomes. Hence, we have students who are ready to get involved in competitions, especially like the ones organised in the annual Star-NiE contests.Our students are already familiar with the concept of shared learning experiences. This type of learning encourages creativity among students. I am proud to say that through such learning experiences, students from SMK Kuala Selangor clinched the Merit Awards in 2016 and 2018 at the NiE contests, namely, Game 4 Life and Star Flicks.Besides using NiE in the classroom, we use this methodology at our Speaker’s Corner where students carry out one-minute speeches during recess. Each student selects a topic taken from the newspaper and speaks on the issue.The teachers, too, play an active role in the school. They take turns to give one-minute speeches during the assemblies. Even the ustaz and ustazah use the English language during this programme.At co-curriculum activities, NiE is a regular feature during English Camps. Students enjoy expressing their ideas from newspaper articles that pique their interests. They use their creativity to present their findings in groups. These outcomes are displayed at the English Corner at the library which are often referred to by the teachers and students.We would like to thank Hartalega, our newspaper sponsors and The Star for their great support. If you are looking for ideas to spruce up your Highly Immersive Programme in school, Star-NiE is a great tool and resource to turn to!— Faridah Kassim, teacher, SMK Kuala Selangor, Selangor\n",

      "SK SUBANG Bestari 2 recently opened its doors to SK Sungai Buloh English panel head Nurhafizah Yaacob who shared her experience on using the Step Up education pullout by The Star.The sharing session not only gave teachers new ideas to take home but also forged a good relationship between the two schools located in Selangor.The colourful 24-page workbook-cum-activity English pullout is designed to help pupils in Years Four, Five and Six prepare for the Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) examination.Step Up also features Chinese and Bahasa Malaysia translations of difficult English words.Nurhafizah recounted the days when her school began their subscription of Step Up, which comes with a copy of The Star newspaper.“Pupils brought the newspaper home and their family felt a subtle change. All this while, they’ve never had an English newspaper in the house.“The parents then contacted the school and suggested that teachers help pupils go through Step Up and incorporate it into lessons,” she said.SK Subang Bestari 2 English panel head Nor Shahbinar Kamil, who teaches Year Six pupils, said that the sharing session was informative.“The students in SK Sungai Buloh and SK Subang Bestari 2 more or less share the the same proficiency levels, so Nurhafizah’s ideas are workable.“This enhances our usage of the pullout.“The session has given me new ideas and the teachers here can expand the usage of Step Up. Apart from using it in class, we can also use it outside of the classroom,” she said.Fellow colleague Siti Farah Azuah Nasir said: “It was a very good sharing session! I’m so glad that she came to our school.”“This is a golden opportunity for teachers in this school to get insights to using Step Up efficiently.“Aside from how to use the pullout, we also learned how to fully utilise the copy of The Star newspaper that comes with the pullout. There are so many activities we can do with the newspaper and the pullout,” she said.“It was also a good gathering for English primary school teachers. It helped us expand knowledge in our line of teaching,” she added.SK Subang Bestari 2 headmaster Md Hishamuddin Md Yaacob said he hopes to have more sharing sessions like this.“It benefits both sides. In the future, we can also share our story with other schools. This is a start of a good relationship between our school and SK Sungai Buloh.”He added that he is thankful that The Star facilitated in helping the school improve English Language teaching.“This helped spark more ideas and showed the many ways teachers can use the pullout and newspaper.”For more information about this English language resource for Primary schools, call The Star’s Customer Care Unit at 1-300-88-7827 from Monday to Friday (9am-5pm). Subscription is through schools only.The pullout is endorsed by the Education Ministry.\n",

      "LITERATURE provides an avenue for students to derive many lessons, which include looking at things from different perspectives and practising empathy.That is what readers get to do through Trevor Millum’s Sad I Ams poem – a text which is part of the English Language literature component for Form One students. In the poem, one is reminded of discarded items, told through the first-person narration.Activities based on the poem, as well as other literary texts, are available for subscribers of The Star’s Newspaper-in-Education (NiE) pullout, which has an English Literature segment centred on the school syllabus.In the pullout, readers will also find teen writers from our BRATs Young Journalist Programme responding to the literary topics and themes.To obtain the activities and read the students’ response, grab a copy of the NiE pullout on Wednesday, March 11.Published bi-monthly, the NiE pullout offers English language activities, and a writing platform for teens. It is available only through school subscriptions of The Star.To subscribe, call the toll free number 1-300-88-7827 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). For more information on Star-NiE’s BRATs programme, go to facebook.com/niebrats.Read on to get a sampling of our teen writers’ response to the Sad I Ams poem. In their response, they wrote fictional autobiographies as they put themselves in the shoes of inanimate objects.Broken into piecesYOU used to stare so deeply into my eyes. Your hands, soft and gentle, used to stroke me so tenderly. “My love, my everything” was your affectionate murmurs as you fixed your fond gaze upon me.I was your pride, the first thing you showed everyone whenever they came; your joy, the last thing you reached for before you fell asleep. I was your protector of the night, standing on the table with a bouquet of roses beside me, both of us keeping watch over you.One evening, the roses went first. As you threw her into the bin, I could only close my eyes to block out the cries of heartache from the roses. (Or was it from you?)The sobs lasted throughout the night, and for the first time, you didn’t take a single glance at me.“This is only temporary, ” I reassured myself, “how would you ever bear to neglect me, whom you call ‘your love, your everything’?”Still, I was filled with a sense of foreboding. At dawn, the sun cast its scorching rays over the room, creating a reflection of light from my glass frame. I felt your gaze upon me, and beamed with delight as you lifted me up slowly.Suddenly, droplets of water came trickling down across my picture of a handsome man. You no longer wailed like you did last night; now, tears flowed silently down your face.Slowly but certainly, a hint of rage started to creep into your eyes. It struck me then that I would never feel your warm look or kind touch again. The same eyes now glared at me in anger, and the same pair of hands hurled me against the wall.Shattered images of love spilled all over the cold marble floor. There I lay, broken and in pieces.Still, I waited. Day after day, I lay there, waiting to be glued back together by your renewed love. But when you swept me away, I realised I didn’t deserve your love anymore. — Ooi Shinz Jo, 16, Chung Ling Private High School, PenangWorn outALLOW me to introduce myself – I am a blouse, born in a factory in Bangladesh. The seamstresses were very efficient, fashioning my friends and me out of plain cloth without any respite in between.Afterwards, I was packed in a box with a dozen of my friends and loaded onto a lorry, which took us to the airport, where we were delivered to Malaysia.In Malaysia, we were taken to a famous international clothing store in Pavilion Kuala Lumpur, where I was hung on a display rack along with my friends.Lots of people came to this store to check out my friends and me as we were affordable and trendy. After a week at the store, I was finally taken off the rack and landed in the arms of a fashionable teenager. Her name was Clara.Clara was proud of me and wore me whenever she could. She took good care of me, always making sure I wasn’t dirtied or damaged, while she stowed her other clothing deep inside her closet. I never had to wait long to be lifted into her arms. I felt so loved and wanted.One day, while I was on one of my rare breaks, Clara entered her room. In her arms was a new blouse. She hung it next to me. I was glad to make a new friend. Little did I know this new friend would be my curse. From then on, Clara started wearing the new blouse, instead of me.I couldn’t believe the turn of events; I thought I would always be Clara’s favourite. What’s worse, I was eventually tossed to the back of her closet, along with others, to make way for newer, trendier clothes.By and by, we overheard Clara’s mother telling her to do something about us as her closet started to overflow. The next day, Clara took us downstairs and dumped us in the trash can, without so much as a backward glance.We ended up in a landfill, far away from Kuala Lumpur. Her actions broke our hearts, but all we could do was to suffer silently. Unfortunately, it would take me – a polyester blouse – hundreds of years to disappear. This is the consequence of fast fashion. — Dennis Lai Yong Jia, 14, SMK Seri Hartamas, Kuala LumpurCannedI REMEMBER being produced in a shabby, old beverage factory where I was later placed in a box and shipped away. We were delivered to a local gas station and got placed in an arctic-like machine. I got the window seat, together with a few others, who shared my curiosity for the future.Three days later, a teenager came walking in. His name was Dennis Fitch. He observed us from behind the transparent wall for a few seconds. Soon after, he reached out for me.It was an exhilarating moment being held in his hand. Though it made me weaker with his every sip, I was thankful I was the one he chose to quench his thirst. Once we reached his car, I was placed in my very own seat. What a thoughtful person, I thought as we drove off.I envisioned the great life we were going to have. It was going to be like everything I had dreamed of. Fifteen minutes later, I was three-quarters gone. My vessel became fragile and I felt lighter than before.Shortly after, we arrived at our destination. Dennis picked me from my seat as he exited the vehicle and made for the beach. Everything around me was enchanting. The sky was a pastel pink as the sunset hit the water and the sand.Dennis took off his sandals and let the cool water sweep over his feet while he glanced at the distance. I felt blissful in that moment.Out of nowhere, a young girl’s voice broke my reverie. She was calling Dennis’ name. Without hesitation, he dropped me and walked away. As I drifted away from the shore, I stared at Dennis’ receding figure. I received no goodbye, not a backward glance, nor a final sip. — Tasshyea P.K. Sivakumaran, 18, Sunway College, Subang Jaya, SelangorA life of serviceSOMETIME in December 2010, two young girls waltzed into a uniform store with their parents. The mother asked the worker at the store to bring out some samples of white baju kurung.It was back-to-school season. I was a highly sought-after product. The lady asked for two pairs of baju kurung for each of her daughters, both in small sizes because of her children’s petite physiques.I was placed in a bag alongside other articles that looked identical to me. The amount of excitement I felt was indescribable.The girl I served turned out to be the younger daughter, who was only six. Her mother placed me on the ironing board to rid me of any creases, ensuring her child would look fresh and clean on her first day in school.The young girl seemed nervous while getting dressed, staring at herself in the mirror, afraid of the challenges ahead. She grabbed her backpack and put on her white slip-on shoes.Right before she headed out the door, she took one last look in the mirror. This time, her nervousness had dissolved, replaced by a look of determination on her face. This was a new beginning, a new chapter that she couldn’t wait to start, and she knew that I’d be there with her every step of the way.I served my owner for three full years, until the day her mother put me into a plastic bag along with other pieces to be donated. My young owner went through the bag and took one last look at me, reminiscing about all the memories we had lived through together.Like the time she got a sticker from her teacher for having the best drawing in class, or the time she fell down in the school’s parking lot while chasing her friend, and tore a small part of me which had to be sewn up.It was a bittersweet journey to say the least, but I was ready to serve another young one. I was ready for my new life. — Firza Azureen Ridzuan, 16, SMK Puteri Titiwangsa, Kuala Lumpur\n",

      "KUALA TERENGGANU: Ex-Petro­nas scholar and Terengganu native Datuk Raiha Azni Abd Rahman shared a joyful and nostalgic mo­ment with the Petronas Education Sponsorship Programme (PESP) 2019 recipients during its award ceremony.“I was curious about the outside world, so I applied to go to the United States and I got it.“I did my tertiary education in New York and it was the best time of my life!” said the company’s senior vice-president (group human re­source management) during the ceremony held at Institut Teknologi Petroleum Petronas in Batu Rakit here yesterday.Raiha, who has been with Petronas for 35 years, told the recipients that it was a “different ball game” in the university.“You have to be independent because you are on your own. It’s how you acclimatise to different environments and manage yourself.“Do mix around as it is the only time to experience other people’s culture.”Star Media Group’s Ng receiving the mock sponsorship cheque from Raiha and Satiful (right).The awards were presented to the recipients by Terengganu state executive council member in charge of education Satiful Bahri Mamat.The 40 Terengganu students were among 400 selected from a total of over 7,355 applicants nationwide.This year, a total of RM156mil was allocated for the sponsorship.Petronas is also adopting 10 trust schools in Terengganu – five each in Kijal and Marang – from 2017 to 2021.The trust school programme by Petronas is a tie-up between Yaya­san Amir and the Education Ministry.Introduced in 2015, the Trenglish (Transforming English in Tereng­ganu) programme, involving 50 schools in the state, is a collaborative effort between the oil and gas company with the state education department and Yayasan Tereng­ganu.Trenglish aims to increase Eng­lish language proficiency among the students.As an added boost, Petronas is sponsoring RM150,000 worth of The Star’s Newspaper-in-Education (NiE) pullout to supplement the programme for the third year.Star Media Group chief content officer Esther Ng received the mock cheque at the event.Written by a team of experienced English language specialists, the NiE pullout is packed with engaging hands-on newspaper activities for the classroom.As supplements to the Petronas’ sponsorship, four NiE workshops are included – two for teachers and two for students – for a more effective use of newspapers in the classroom.One of the recipients, Muhammad Adib Rusydi Mohd Zawawi from Imtiaz Kuala Berang, said that NiE and Trenglish had helped him tremendously as the interview with Petronas was held in English.\n",

      "WHICH is the key word in the phrase “as soon as possible”? Is it “soon” or “possible”?On Wednesday, after a special meeting of the Malay Rulers at Istana Negara to discuss efforts to combat Covid-19, the King called for Parliament to be reconvened “as soon as possible”.For the Opposition – and Umno leaders who aren’t fans of Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin’s Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia – the key is “soon”. For example, the Pakatan Harapan presidential council stated that Muhyiddin should not prolong the suspension of Parliament any longer.On the other hand, the Perikatan Nasional coalition government is focusing on “possible”. Soon is not possible because of the Covid-19 numbers. A day before the special meeting, Muhyiddin outlined that Parliament would open once the Covid-19 situation improves in September or October.For Prof James Chin, from the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania, Australia, the statement “as soon as possible” simply means ASAP.“The King has previously said that regardless of the state of emergency, Parliament can convene. All the MPs have been vaccinated, there is no reason they can’t push for Parliament to be opened ASAP,” he said.For Universiti Utara Malaysia political lecturer Prof Dr Mohd Azizuddin Mohd Sani, the key word is also “possible”. He said “as soon as possible” is possibly linked to the number of Malaysians vaccinated.“We are targeting 80%, but by the end of the year, the highest we can reach is 60%. We need to cater to the issue of vaccination. If there is an election – for example, the Sarawak election – and if vaccination is not an issue, then the election can be held soon,” he said.“When Parliament is open, we will know how many MPs support the government and the Opposition respectively. If Umno decides not to support Perikatan, we might have to get ready for a general election.”(The Sarawak State Legislative Assembly expired on June 6, but it will continue until Aug 1 due to the Emergency. If the Emergency is lifted, the state election must be called within 60 days. Four by-elections are also on hold because of the Emergency.)Universiti Malaya political analyst Dr Muhammad Asri Mohd Ali says that the phrase is not a titah (order).“The executive will decide when is the appropriate time. They are not bound. Let’s say ‘soon’ is two or three months from now since it was the advice or opinion of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong,” he said.“Politicians, especially the Opposition, will say anything to take advantage of recent event. It’s normal.”So how soon will Parliament reconvene?Prof Chin said there are many rumours circulating that it will happen on Aug 2: “That is funny as there’s no guarantee. It depends on the Covid-19 situation in July. If it gets worse and there’s no clear recovery, I suspect things will not be as smooth as the Opposition thinks.“It is the government’s decision, whether they want to have a sitting right now or not. And if they want to delay, they can wait until the end of the state of emergency.”Prof Mohd Azizuddin of Univer-siti Utara Malaysia concurred that it is up to the Perikatan government to decide on a date: “If they want to delay it, they can until the end of the Emergency,” he said.He pointed out that the Oppo-sition has gone on the offensive by saying that the government must listen to the Royal Council and reconvene the august house soon. But the Royal Council doesn’t want to be seen as intervening in politics, he said.Universiti Malaya’s Muhammad Asri argued that it is up to the executive branch of government led by the Prime Minister to decide when is the appropriate time for Parliament to call for a meeting.On Wednesday, the Malay Rulers stated that there is no need to keep the country under a state of emergency beyond Aug 1. I asked the three political analysts if they think the Emergency will be lifted on that date.Prof Mohd Azizuddin believes it will end then: “The Royal Council clearly mentions it.”Muhammad Asri agrees: “Even though we said the Rulers issued only their opinion on this matter, the executive will agree with it to show their respect for our monarchy,” he said.“For the Sarawak state election, since the state government’s duration ended early this month, maybe the executive will ask for an Emergency at the state level. Otherwise, Sarawak must hold state elections in the midst of the Covid-19 situation,” he said.Prof Chin thinks otherwise. He said the government will probably only decide on lifting the Emergency in the middle of July based on the Covid-19 numbers. If infections and deaths are high at that time, it might have no choice but to ask for the Emergency to be extended, he said.“Obviously, without the restrictions, you cannot control Covid-19. You cannot vaccinate your way out of this situation because even if you look at the government’s timeline, you can only get herd immunity at the end of the year,” he said.But Prof Chin also pointed out that the government could impose the same restrictions without using the word “Emergency” – “So even without the state of emergency, all the restrictions will be in place,” he said.The possibility of opening Parlia-ment as soon as possible and lifting the Emergency on Aug 1 have turned up the political heat – which is the opposite of what the Rulers desired, I’m sure. Politicians are back to counting the numbers of MPs they have or could have in support as they speculate about a new government.Prof Mohd Azizuddin said we’ll know how stable Perikatan is when Parliament reopens.Prof Chin noted that while some people are excited about a change of government, he doesn’t think it’s that simple.“If we are talking about a backdoor coup, yes, that’s always possible. But if we talk about a coup through Parliament, I doubt it.Not in the present circumstances,” he said.On whether the Perikatan government would survive when Parliament reconvenes, Muham-mad Asri said it depends on several factors. Like the strength of the Perikatan coalition, to begin with.“If they are still intact, and Barisan Nasional or any other component party still supports them, then they will survive,” he said.It also depends on how far Perikatan can push Parliamentary procedure: “If they can stop a vote of confidence from being held, then they will survive,” he said.The third factor is the approval of the budget in October: “If the Opposition behaved like it did last October when some of them approved the budget and only Tun M (Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad) and few others rejected it, then the status quo will remain,” he said.“The key players that can pose a threat to the Perikatan government are the Barisan Nasional members of Parliament. Some of them like (Gua Musang MP) Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, (Padang Rengas MP) Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz and a few others have been openly against the government.”Muhammad Asri added that Muhyiddin and the Perikatan government will use every bit of power at their disposal to make sure they have enough support in Parliament.“We already saw this when some PKR MPs from Sarawak crossed the floor at the end of last year,” he said.There’s too much politicking in the country, with some wanting to be PM or in power as soon as possible. But the big concern for the rakyat is that the Covid-19 pandemic will be controlled as soon as possible.\n",

      "Dear Dr G,I am a 30-year-old man who has been married for more than two years.My wife and I have always dreamt of having kids to complete our family.We have both tried very hard and have regular sex in the hope she will get pregnant.Sadly, there has been no success despite regular intercourse over the last two years.My wife went for a check-up with the gynaecologist and was given the all-clear.When I went for my fertility tests, I found out I had been \"firing blanks\" all along.My sex life, by all accounts, is normal and I have libido, erection and ejaculation.Apparently, I have azoospermia, a medical condition where there is no sperm in my semen.How is it possible that I ejaculate normally but there is no sperm in it?What exactly is azoospermia and why is it affecting me?Lastly, the doctor suggested that I undergo a small operation where they will retrieve sperm from my testes for test tube babies. Is that necessary?I really hope to celebrate Fathers' Days in the future – so is my hope for fatherhood dashed for good?RegardsBlank BenjaminAzoospermia is a medical condition where a man has normal sexual function and ejaculation but his semen contains no sperm. The obvious but undesirable outcome is male-factor infertility.Azoospermia affects up to 1% of the male population, but prevalence can be as high as 20% when investigating the cause of infertility in couples.Although a diagnosis of azoospermia sounds devastating, many forms of the condition are amenable to medical treatment to restore fertility.Under normal circumstances, sperm are formed and mature in the testicles, which travel through the reproductive tract to the prostate. The sperm will mix with seminal and prostatic secretions that make up semen. With or without sperm, the secretion forms a viscous, white fluid that comes out of the penis.Men can continue to ejaculate normally, oblivious to the fact they are \"firing blanks\" until a semen analysis is carried out.Azoospermia is generally classified as obstructive and non-obstructive in origin. The two different types can further be sub-classified into congenital and acquired azoospermia.Obstructive azoospermia constitutes 40% of azoospermia due to defect of the vas deferens or epididymis resulting in occlusion of the passage of sperms from the testicles. The common reason for such physical obstruction is vasectomy, when the intended intervention for contraception causes men to fire blanks. Other forms of acquired obstructive azoospermia may include testicular trauma and infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea causing the scarring of the vas.Genetic mutations are also known to result in obstructive azoospermia. Men who have cystic fibrosis or carry such genetic mutation may have a defective connection of the vas causing congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. Other inborn deformities such as congenital prostatic cysts are also well-recognised rendering sperm passage obstruction.The non-obstructive form of azoospermia can be caused by defective testicles with the inability to produce or allow the maturation of sperm. This can be due to undescended testicles or spermatogenic arrest. Other acquired destruction of spermatogenesis includes childhood mumps, cancer, diabetes, varicocele and radiation that destroy normal sperm production, causing azoospermia.The most basic way to diagnose azoospermia is through semen analysis. Blood investigations and the biopsy of the testicles can also assist a definitive diagnosis of obstructive or non-obstructive azoospermia. It can also identify the presence of sperm that can be potentially used to fertilise embryos.A biopsy and extraction of sperm are usually done concurrently. Samples are retrieved using a small needle to harvest sperm directly from the scrotum. In addition, a small procedure to explore the reproductive tracts with the assistance of a microscope can also have the added benefit of getting healthy sperm for the purpose of IVF and test-tube babies.For many men, a diagnosis of azoospermia can be a blow to a dream of fatherhood. In the last few decades, however, advancements in research for male infertility and refinement of sperm retrieval have contributed so much to the art of ART (artificial reproductive technology) that the obstacles of azoospermia can be overcome.The 16th-century Italian philosopher, astronomer and mathematician Giordano Bruno once said \"time is the father of truth\".Dr G when put on the spot says \"time is of absolute essence to discover the father of truth\" as early intervention to give nature a helping hand! On that note, I wish Ben a smooth journey and all fathers out there a Happy Fathers' Day!\n",

The opposition leaders are calling for his resignation and he is staring at what might be an epic showdown of numbers in Parliament very soon.Everything seems to point to another round of political instability for the country.If there is anything good to be said about the unpopular Emergency Ordinance, it is that the restrictive order brought down the political temperature.However, the mercury is rising again and from most accounts, Muhyiddin is preparing to bite the bullet and face his opponents in Parliament.He took over the premiership on a controversial note but with a high approval rating. But he is now at the most vulnerable point in his premiership largely as a result of the government’s handling of the pandemic.So is his job on the line?If he fails to muster the numbers against an ambitious opposition bench that has rallied behind their prime minister candidate Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, then yes, his ruling coalition will be in trouble.However, it is untrue that the Malay Rulers want Muhyiddin out. That conclusion was drawn from the Sultans’ emphasis on the need for a stable government that enjoys the confidence of the rakyat.Palace sources said that people have either over-read the statement or chose to read it it they way they want things to go.The Yang di-Pertuan Agong and his brother Rulers - said the source - are concerned about the pandemic and its effects on the economy and people’s livelihood.Like everyone else, they think the government could have done better in managing the pandemic and that the political leadership could do more to regain the people’s confidence.The royals are said to live in a gilded cage but social media has enabled them to tune in to what people are saying about issues, about their political leaders and even about the royals themselves.The Rulers believe they need to be proactive to voice their concerns.They are aware that certain segments of society think they have over-stepped their role as a constitutional monarchy but these are unusual times, and unusual times call for unusual measures.“Personally, I think it’s alright for the King to engage the stakeholders. Tuanku Agong did not want to leave anyone out as we prepare to the end the Emergency,” said former Kapar Umno division chief Datuk Faizal Abdullah.The Rulers spoke as one voice at their Tuesday meeting although the Sultan of Johor’s motorcade leaving early had sparked speculation.The Johor sovereign had flown over in his own jet but left before the meeting was over. He apparently had to be back at the Senai Airport which closes early as a result of the emergency. He had in fact arrived early to join the King for lunch.There were also reports that the Yang Di Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan was not among those arriving in the afternoon but he arrived on the dot at 3pm after getting his swab test result, a requisite for all attendees.Putrajaya acknowledged the outcome of the Rulers’ meeting with a brief and terse statement that one political observer equated to an “OK, noted with thanks”.Everyone can see that ties between Putrajaya and the Palace are not exactly all sunshine and everything nice at the moment.The Palace statement was couched in royal nomenclature but it is clear that the royals want Parliament to convene and for the emergency to end after Aug 1.There appears to be some sort of tug-of-war over when Parliament should meet. Putrajaya was looking at a September date whereas the Rulers want it as soon as possible.A standoff would not be good, it would be seen as challenging the Palace.As it is, police reports have been lodged against de-facto Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan for insisting that Parliament will meet in September, in line with what the Prime Minister said when unveiling the national recovery plan on Tuesday.Whether Parliament meets sooner or later, the coming sitting is set to be the mother of all sittings.Pakatan leaders are elated, they feel they are a step closer to returning to Putrajaya and Opposition Leader Anwar is once against within sight of the premiership.“It’s the most positive development for us since the Sheraton Move. After meeting the political leaders, the King can see people are not happy with the current government,” said a PKR parliamentarian.Ideas like a minority government and even something entirely new like a unity government are being tossed about ahead of Parliament convening.“I don’t want to spoil the mood but we should not discount the possibility that if pushed to the wall, if the situation gets too chaotic, Muhyiddin may decide to advise the King to dissolve Parliament,” said Umno supreme council member Datuk Seri Johari Ghani.The Prime Minister does not have to name the election date straight away.“Under the constitution, he has 60 days to decide on the date of election. In the meantime, he can push on with the vaccination to bring down the infection numbers,” said Johari.Muhyiddin’s numbers will probably be tested during the voting of bills like what happened during the Budget session last year.It is not just a question of whether Muhyiddin has enough numbers to hold the fort, but also whether Anwar can live up to his claim of having strong and convincing numbers.Anwar’s numbers will hinge on whether Warisan president Datuk Seri Shafie Apdal and Pejuang advisor Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad decide to come onboard.The reality is that both sides are struggling in this enervating numbers game.Political commentator and lawyer Khaw Veon Szu put it well in saying that any change of government, be it by the backdoor or the sidedoor, will not stable.“It will suffer the same fate as the current government. Whichever side we want to support, let them come in by the rightful way - through a general election,” said Khaw.\n",

      "IT should be obvious by now that extending the Emergency when it ends on Aug 1 is not an option.The Rulers have made it clear that they aren’t keen on an extension. And that’s also the sentiment on the ground.It’s safe to say the Establishment and supporters of the government would want the same.There’s still a good six weeks to the end of the Emergency, and the Prime Minister won’t need to announce its conclusion.But Cabinet members must take the necessary steps and plan the days leading to the end of this situation.There’s nothing worse than senior Cabinet members exhibiting symptoms of the dreaded foot-in-mouth disease – contradicting and covering themselves in shame.The run-up to Aug 1 would be on engaging with stakeholders – especially civil servants, policy makers, business groups and the media – on preparations made leading to that date.This is where strategic communications come in, so a compromise beckons, and not because the government is perceived as reacting unwillingly to the advice of the Rulers.Politicians and lawyers will always have their arguments, and each time they make a statement, it doesn’t mean they’re right even if they sound convincing.Even well-qualified judges at the Federal Court vote accordingly on the verdict after hearing the points of law.But the bottom line is, the PM decides when the Emergency should end, and if he sees fit to recommend an extension, he will need the King’s consent.The King can decide on his own, without having to seek the consensus of the other Rulers.But His Majesty has prepared himself well. Ahead of Aug 1, he has rightly sought the advice of the Rulers, and they have told him two things – end the Emergency by August and have Parliament convene as soon as possible.I’m sure the PM and Cabinet fully respect the views of the King and the Rulers.Constitutional experts have outlined the vague points on who can really end the Emergency, but given our reverence for our Rulers, no Malay politician would risk losing their popularity by ignoring the palace.Also, it’s procedurally right for the PM to first hear the views of the independent special committee on the Emergency, and the Cabinet, too.If not, what would be the point of forming the special panel if their recommendations aren’t even heard and considered?Only when he has digested their feedback and formed his views can he seek an audience with the King to let His Majesty know his decision.I’m sure the PM is explicitly aware of the political effects of an extension to the Emergency.There would be little reason for him to do so knowing the King is against it. Besides, public opinion echoes that sentiment, too.However you slice it, when the PM first convinced the nation that the Emergency was necessary to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, most Malaysians agreed with it.After all, our leaders should be focused on ensuring we were safe from the deadly virus. In fact, during MCO1.0, public perception was that the government was doing a good job.But then, we went downhill. We are at MCO3.0 because we have gone from bad to worse. It’s gone off the rails with the numbers still increasing and the pandemic raging as we scramble with vaccinations.Have we come to a point where we’re supposed to celebrate when our daily number of Covid-19 cases drop to 4,000-odd? And are we serious about embracing leniency when there’s talk of it?At 4,000-odd, we’re surely not out of the woods because the forest is still on fire, so we can’t ease off the brakes.Our politicians gave in to the demands for Ramadan markets, interstate travel last December for Christmas and New Year, and then Gawai, just to score populist points. Unfortunately, that all added to new clusters.We can’t continue to concede to the pressure of our communities because the Health Ministry has already said it needs at least four months to flatten the curve, so the ban on inter-district travel for Gawai in Sarawak is a step in the right direction.Having communicated with key MOH officials struggling with the pandemic the last two years, this writer was told how tired, frustrated and even angry they’ve been.They’re aware of the balance needed to keep the country safe and also, the economy running.After all, these officials have families and friends who have shared with them the difficulties in keeping their jobs and businesses going. People are desperate, and many are starving as they struggle to put food on the table.But as these frontliners continue with their thankless work, let’s not make it difficult for them with silly calls for a general election, which could only send many of us to the morgue.Don’t be convinced by those who tell us that it’s safe to hold elections because they’re the same people who campaigned in the Sabah election last year and caused the entire country to suffer.Many of these campaigners, which included top politicians, flouted the standard operating procedures, and even ignored quarantine rules. So, if you believe these politicians will keep their promises, then you will believe anything.Moving ahead, as the Emergency period ends and Parliament resumes, let’s be prepared for all the usual drama, the likes of plots to overthrow the government and previously-unthinkable political alliances – mostly to keep players out of jail or to form a new government and enjoy the perks.Then there will also be politicians who should retire yet still think they are PM material, and politicians masquerading as theologians who use religion to justify their political acrobatics.We really need to stay safe from Covid-19, and now, also from such politicians.\n",

      "AS Malaysia intensifies its vaccination efforts to flatten the Covid-19 infection curve, companies and private organisations are also playing their part by offering to help the government in this crucial effort.It’s commendable that many have stepped forward to allow their facilities and manpower to be used for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.Their contributions in the past weeks seem to be paying off as the country crossed the 200,000-dose mark with 215,876 jabs administered on Tuesday.To date, more than 1.5 million Malaysians – or 4.7% of the targeted 80% of the population – have completed their vaccination with two doses while another 5.3 million have received first doses.The interval between the first and second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is between 21 and 42 days, for Sinovac it’s 21 days, and for AstraZeneca it’s 12 weeks.Another one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine is scheduled to arrive later this month and in July while 12 million Sinovac doses are on track to be delivered by July – coupled with the accelerating rate of vaccination, Malaysia could actually achieve the 40% immunisation target by August.This is where help from local companies and organisations is needed to keep accelerating the vaccination rate.With the government hoping to increase the daily vaccination rate to between 300,000 and 400,000 shots in the next few weeks, more manpower and venues are needed.It would help immensely if more local companies and Malaysians could rise to the occasion and offer their space and volunteers to keep the programme running smoothly.The faster we all get vaccinated, the quicker the infection curve can be flattened, enabling the country to open up so we can get back on our feet and fix the besieged economy.Malaysians must do their part and register to get vaccinated.The Health Ministry has given its assurance that all those who have registered through the MySejahtera app will be given a date to receive their vaccines.If you haven’t registered yet, what are you waiting for?As millions are jabbed around the world, the evidence just keeps getting stronger: Apart from lessening the chances of catching Covid-19, if you do get it, being vaccinated lessens the risk of getting the severe form of the disease and, most importantly, of dying from it.While the government is trying hard to make sure Malaysia gets vaccinated quickly, the onus is on all of us to register for our vaccination appointments – and not to miss the date once we get it.Let’s do this together to get the nation back on track.\n",

      "THE concept of a #BangsaMalaysia is not new. It goes at least as far back as Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammad’s Wawasan 2020, which included the formation of a national identity.Other groups and civil society organisations have championed the formation of a #BangsaMalaysia identity over the years, but so far, traction has unfortunately been limited.Two factors that have contributed to this – one, the fact that there has yet to be a broad based movement for #BangsaMalaysia that truly cuts across multiple segments of society; and two, how political elites have generally been opposed to the idea.A lack of political will to implement and push a #BangsaMalaysia narrative may be related to race based parties that believe their relevance might be lessened should such a national identity become dominant.A fragmented civil society landscape has also hampered the creation of such a national identity from the ground up.This fragmentation mirrors the fragmentation of society over the past few decades. Where some expected the internet to be a great unifier, it may instead have encouraged echo chambers and the tendency to surround oneself primarily with those who think and speak like ourselves.The good news is that it is not too late to reverse this trend. There are many Malaysians who want to see a united #BangsaMalaysia. The big question is: how do we make it happen?I think if any individual or small group tried to give a top down definition of what #BangsaMalaysia should be, that definition would be meaningless.Perhaps the only meaningful definition of #BangsaMalaysia would be one which is defined together from the bottom up. This process would involve the coming together of Malaysians from all walks of life, and all parts of the country, to start the conversation about what it means to be Malaysian, and what the shared values that form the core of our national identity should be.We can’t expect everyone to have the same views on what those values should be – but if we have enough of these conversations with enough Malaysians, maybe we can identify which values keep coming up most frequently.These most frequently cited values would essentially constitute a common ground that can be subscribed to by the largest possible number of Malaysians. They would represent both the diverse aspirations of ordinary Malaysians as well as their vision for a better Malaysia.To get a truly representative picture, we’d need to engage the entire spectrum of communities that make up our beautifully diverse nation – including (but certainly not limited to) the majority Malay-Muslims, Chinese, Indians, Kadazans, Dayaks, Orang Asli, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Taoists, teachers, lawyers, engineers, small traders - from Perlis to Johor, Penang to Sabah, and everywhere in between.Besides conversations on shared values, this may also be a good time to have meaningful discussions about national policies.Sometimes, national policies are overly influenced by political calculations or other narrow interests. This is something of a tragedy, especially when there are at least hundreds of Malaysians who are experts in their policy sectors, who I bet could craft extremely good rakyat-centric policies.This is a long and involved journey of course, but like every other journey, it begins with a single step. It may be worthwhile to convene conversations with policy experts, perhaps starting with some big picture discussions about the roads Malaysia has taken so far with regards to specific policy sectors, and then, more importantly, what roads we should be taking moving forward.I personally would really love to hear from experts in fields like health policy, economics, education, the environment, migration, international trade, foreign policy, and so on, about how we ended up where we are, and where we should go next.While many think tanks and similar groups have organised similar initiatives, most of them are limited to a particular policy sector, and to the best of my knowledge, none have been organised as part of an overarching, comprehensive national initiative where each policy sector is seen as one piece of the grand Malaysian puzzle.Both these dialogue initiatives are deeply linked to the concept of social capital. Needless to say, talk that stays only talk is of limited use. What we want is talk that leads to greater mutual understanding, and even more importantly, relationship building.These types of relationships are absolutely vital when it comes to solving our nation’s problems. For instance, there is a tendency for conflicts involving race and religion to flare up quite frequently. When they do, the public domain is flooded with voices from either extreme, and most attention is focused on the angriest, loudest people.Those angry and loud people though, do not necessarily represent the middle majority of Malaysia, who prefer peacefulresolutions to conflict that are borne out of an atmosphere of mutual respect.When more relationships have been built between leaders of different communities, it becomes so much easier to pick up the phone and have conversations that can then lead to joint statements and leadership that emphasises resolving conflicts, and providing an alternate centre of gravity.This kind of diverse leadership can be an important element in defusing highly charged conflicts and championing moderate narratives.In the policy sector, greater dialogue between policy experts can perhaps lead to a policy bank - a ready to go set of policies for Malaysia that can be drawn on by anyone leading the country.The more voices there are at the policy making table, the more likely the emerging policies will represent the best, most comprehensive solutions to the problems at hand, and avoid pitfalls caused by having blindspots.Engaging meaningfully with so many diverse groups on both nation-building and policy formulation will surely be a gargantuan task - but not one that is impossible, in my humble opinion. Given how video conferencing has become the new normal, it is mostly a matter of who has the time and energy.I am delighted to report that indeed, some have already taken up the mantle. It’s going to require a lot of drive, but hopefully the first few dialogues in this spirit will help create enough momentum and interest to keep the initiative alive!Nathaniel Tan is working with POWR and Abim on Siri Dialog #BangsaMalaysia.

      "WITH the high number of daily Covid-19 cases despite the enforcement of the movement control order and the implementation of the national Covid-19 immunisation programme, it is timely to re-evaluate the current strategies for successful control of this raging pandemic.While there are many factors that have contributed to the third wave of Covid-19 in Malaysia, the element of testing plays a vital role in the management of the coronavirus disease.It was reported recently that Malaysia’s Covid-19 positive rate is higher than the threshold set by the World Health Organisation (WHO).Positivity rate indicates the portion of positive Covid-19 cases tested out of the total tests conducted. Higher positivity rates mean that more testing should be done, as it suggests that there are more people with the virus in the community who have not been detected yet.If in fact insufficient tests are being conducted, then the decrease in daily reported number of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia may not reflect the actual pandemic situation in the country.Taking a leaf out of other Asian countries’ booksThe surge in cases has undoubtedly put further strain on the swab collection system – adding further delay in identifying Covid-19 positive individuals and allowing them to be out in the community and at risk of infecting others while awaiting their results.To break the chain of infection, a proven strategy to step up testing using the RT-PCR with quick result turnaround time of no more than 24 hours must be employed nationwide. This will help to identify infected individuals effectively for isolation and treatment while reducing further spread of the virus to others.Asian countries that have been successful in their Covid-19 management despite being among the most impacted at the start of the pandemic are China, South Korea and Singapore. These countries learned quickly that test results must be fast and accurate – to prevent a huge backlog in testing centres, laboratories and the public health laboratory information system.For instance, South Korea has turned to point-of-care testing devices that can produce RT-PCR results within 30 to 60 minutes – much faster than standard diagnostic equipment which typically requires six hours.With these systems – namely the Veri-Q PREP M16 and Veri-Q PCR 316 manufactured by MiCo BioMed from South Korea – up to 288 tests per machine can potentially be processed within 24 hours without compromising accuracy.The South Korean success modelAlthough South Korea was one of the first countries to report Covid-19 infections outside China in late January 2020, it managed to prevent a disruptive nationwide epidemic and contained well any occasional flare-ups.Hence, South Korea was able to flatten the curve without closing businesses, issuing stay-at-home orders, or implementing many of the stricter measures adopted by other high-income countries.It achieved this success by conducting comprehensive testing, in addition to thorough contact tracing and many reforms to boost public health emergency preparedness and response.The South Korean government also worked closely with the private sector to ensure innovative and high-capacity screening facilities.A company at the forefront of this global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic is MiCo BioMed Co Ltd, a public listed company on the Korean stock market (KOSDAQ).Led by chief executive officer Sung Woo Kim, a former Korean-American scientist, the company has developed 30 different kinds of high-risk pathogen diagnostic kits for the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).The healthcare solutions developer announced in February 2020 its rapid molecular diagnostic system which detects the novel coronavirus with high sensitivity and accuracy within an hour.Since then, the Veri-Q PREP M16 and Veri-Q PCR 316 systems have been used in South Korea, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Romania, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, Colombia and the United States.Capable of conducting a minimum of two million tests per month depending on the number of machines deployed, the Veri-Q PCR 316 employs MiCo BioMed’s proprietary “Lab-on-a-Chip” technology to detect the smallest amount of virus at the earliest phase of infection.Additionally, the system’s lightweight and portable build (approximately 4kg) makes it suitable to be applied not only at healthcare centres, but also at airports, drive-through centres as well as quarantine sites at a lower cost setup.Post-pandemic, these devices also have the versatility of testing up to 14 different diseases including malaria and dengue.Planned entry into South-East Asian marketsTo complement the ongoing rollout of a nationwide vaccination programme in Malaysia, early and quick testing remains an important key to managing a virus outbreak especially as more variants are being discovered.Testing is crucial towards helping to treat, isolate or hospitalise infected people, while assisting public health officials to characterise the prevalence, speed and contagiousness of the virus.The efficient early containment testing systems that are used in South Korea will be an added advantage for this country.The equipment to test and provide timely results will enable frontliners to execute contact tracing with lower labour cost and shorter length of time required to act, which is exactly what Malaysia needs right now.By sharing South Korea’s lessons to apply fundamental principles in combatting Covid-19, aggressively tracking down infections and performing accurate testing, it is possible for the time-consuming and costly act of managing the pandemic to be mitigated significantly.Following its recent expansion into South-East Asian markets, MiCo BioMed has expressed interest to share its expertise with Malaysia and strive to meet the increasing need for Covid-19 diagnostic testing and other diseases beyond the pandemic.For more information on MiCo BioMed and its products, email its sole authorised reseller (SEA) at medical@asiacodingcentre.com or contact them at 03-6413 3533.\n",

      "UNDERSTANDABLY, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, parents are concerned about increased health and safety risks when sending their children overseas to further their education.According to the Higher Education Ministry’s statistics, 73,000 Malaysian students were studying abroad in 2019, with the majority seeking their education in the United Kingdom and Ireland (26.4%). But the numbers dropped significantly to 39,882 in 2020.However, there may be a workaround that might prove beneficial so that students can benefit from an international education, while staying safe on home ground.Those keen to pursue higher studies in the UK, in particular, can take a look at the international branch of the University of Reading, the University of Reading Malaysia (UoRM), which offers a number of flexible pathways and options.Ranked 75 in the world for international outlook in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020, the University of Reading boasts several world-renowned centres of academic excellence, including the Henley Business School, the School of Built Environment, the School of Law, as well as the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences.Flexible possibilitiesAt UoRM, students are able to start their studies locally and take advantage of its flexible mobility programme. This transfer option would allow students to complete their studies at the university’s UK campus in Reading, once international travel regulations are better hammered out.Furthermore, studying at the local campus proves to be more affordable, with the overall estimated cost costing 40% less than studying three years in the UK, taking into account university fees and living expenses.On top of that, students may be eligible to receive a merit-based High Achievers Scholarship worth up to 30% off their programme fees.The programmes at UoRM are identical to those on the UK campus, following the same curriculum and academic quality standards. Furthermore, UoRM’s state-of-the-art campus and digital learning suite will also provide students with excellent learning facilities and support.The local campus is located in EduCity Iskandar Johor - touted as Asia’s first multi-campus education city - and offers a number of signature degree programmes in the following disciplines:> Accounting> Finance> Management and business> Law> Psychology> Quantity surveying> Real estateWhen students do eventually make their way to the UK, they would be pleased to note that the university’s main campus in the UK is set in 130ha of beautiful parkland and has won the Green Flag award nine times in a row, making it one of the UK’s best green spaces. It is also equipped with sports facilities, eateries, a supermarket and on-campus accommodation.A bonus? The campus is just a short bus ride away from Reading town centre. With ample shops, restaurants and amenities, it happens to be a 22-minute train ride to London.Flexible commencementStudents with A-level, STPM, UEC or equivalent qualifications may apply for UoRM undergraduate degrees, while those with SPM or IGCSE qualifications may enrol in the 12-month International Foundation Programme.Upon successful progression, students may take on their undergraduate studies either in the Malaysian or UK campus. In the meantime, the local campus has three different commencement periods - April, July and September – to give students further flexibility.The faculty is also expanding and accepting new faculty members who might be interested in joining the local campus.

      "IPOH: In efforts to help the government increase the vaccination rate, Klinik De Era, is among the private clinics here, roped in to expedite the Covid-19 vaccination exercise.The clinic’s resident doctor, Dr Shaun Ashley Chin, said the clinic is part of the National Immunisation Programme chosen as a vaccination centre.Dr Chin said the clinic carries out vaccinations three days a week (Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays), with 18 people vaccination per day.“It has been almost two years that the pandemic has hit us, and it is affecting everyone, and as doctors we believe it is our duty to serve, and ensure the vaccination process is expedited.“Thus we decided to be part of the programme, as herd immunity can only be achieved once more people are vaccinated, ” he said in an interview at the clinic here today. (June 18)Dr Chin said the aesthetic and functional medicine clinic established in 2013 at Taman Ipoh Selatan, had started administering vaccines starting June 15.He said recipients who received appointment notifications via the MySejahtera application would need to have their temperature checked first before they are taken to a waiting area, and thereafter to the vaccination room.“Our staff will explain the procedures to them, ask them about their health conditions before administering the vaccine.“Since we started the vaccination programme, people have been calling our clinic to enquire about the vaccines.“We will be given a list of the people getting vaccinated by the Health Ministry, and walk-ins requesting to be vaccinated will not be allowed, ” he said, adding the majority of those vaccinated at the clinics were aged 70-years-old and above.Dr Chin said many of the senior citizens who came to get vaccinated at the clinic were concerned about the type of vaccines they were receiving, but most of them were glad that their turn had arrived to be vaccinated.\n",

Homegrown brands, once flourishing, now struggle to keep up with an unprepared economy.Coupled with their scepticism to move into the digital space, local small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face uncertainty in pressing forward with their businesses in the current market.To help these local businesses navigate the challenges of the digital landscape, Digi Business - together with Malaysia’s national economic regeneration plan (Penjana) - has launched the affordable and user-friendly Go Digital bundles, which will help get them online and establish a virtual presence with ease and speed.Take for example a brick-and-mortar bakery shop that has expanded its business online.The shop owner - let’s call him Raj - is an everyday traditional businessman who has leveraged the various tools offered by Digi Business’ all-in-one digital solution to become the proud owner of an online bakery.Once he utilised the social e-commerce tools to kickstart his online bakery, he promoted his breads and pastries with the available digital marketing tools to reach a wider market of customers.At the same time, Raj also made use of the virtual business landline system, which directs all business calls to his mobile phone, meaning that he is able to conduct business on-the-go at any time.Beyond that, the bundle also helps provide for his business human resource (HR) needs through altHR, a super app that manages essential HR processes digitally.Leveraging the Go Digital bundle, Raj thus managed to skip the hassle of outsourcing these services to different providers and vendors.Best of all, his business can save up to 70% when it goes digital with Digi Business, from only RM349 a month.Understanding that not every business is like Raj’s with different needs and requirements, Digi Business also offers other packages with connectivity plans.These include the value-packed postpaid plans with free-of-charge smartphones to help keep personal and work life separate on different devices.Moreover, in today’s digitally connected world, Digi Business will enable you to always be online via the ultra-fast, unlimited fibre internet with speeds up to 800Mbps and even unlimited high-speed mobile broadband - especially because Digi has recently been recognised as Malaysia’s fastest mobile network by Ookla.On top of that, SMEs that opt for three to five mobile or data plans will also receive free digital solutions for marketing or productivity, with up to 30% savings off their monthly bill.That’s not all. Businesses also stand to enjoy up to RM6, 000 in savings from Penjana and Digi Business when they sign up for the Penjana SME Digitalisation Grant. Digi Business will also assist SMEs in the application process for the grant.Visit digi.my/GoDigital to learn more or scan the QR code for more information.\n",

      "Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (MATRADE) has been instrumental in grooming mid-tier companies (MTCs) from various industries to become global champions.Leveraging on sustainability as pre-requisite to enhance the competitiveness, MATRADE has identified relevant companies with potential products and technologies that can be promoted further in the international marketplace.With MATRADE’s support and assistance, one of these companies that succeeded in making it in the global plastic industry is the multiple award winning integrated plastic recycling company Heng Hiap Industries Sdn Bhd (HHI).In sustainability agenda, HHI is the first in the world to receive Ocean Bound Plastic (OBP) certification initiated by Zero Plastic Ocean, audited by Control Union and witnessed by World Wildlife Fund (WWF).According to HHI founder and chief executive officer Seah Kian Hoe, MATRADE has been consistently offering different marketing programmes and exhibition opportunities abroad, through which the company reached out to more customers from different countries and various industrial players.“We couldn’t be prouder to be an exhibitor overseas together with MATRADE. The joint exhibition with MATRADE is more effective than an individual company, as we are representing the country when at exhibitions like K-Fair in Germany,” he shared.“MATRADE overseas offices have been constantly promoting HHI and providing new customer leads to us,” he said in email interview.Seah added: “MATRADE has been able to connect to a wide variety of informal communities, including tailgate sorter, faith-based charity group, Tzu Chi, material pickers, building cleaner, and mobile collectors.”On how HHI succeeded in developing technology to safely break down plastic waste into clean and sustainable raw materials, he said that they have built a standard protocol for plastic waste collection among the 28,000 communities to ensure the consistency of quality before they start processing the material into smart plastics.“The entire production process is strictly controlled by ISO9001 standard. The quality assurance department regularly checks the finished goods via in-house testing instrument including XRF machine complying with RoHS1 for detection of heavy metal contaminant,” he revealed.As of 2020, the company has 18 intellectual property and one trademark, while three more trademarks will be registered this year.In its plastics recycling business, HHI adopts mechanical recycling (plastic waste into pelletize material that fulfill the industrial standard, converting three types of recycled plastics: rPP, rPE and rPET), and chemical recycling (converting of non-recycled plastic waste into an energy carrier or Naphtha like feedstock).On HHI’s role in promoting sustainable environmental practices, Seah said, they have been practising the 5Cs – collect, convert, co-create, champion and consume.HHI’s growth initiatives support three key sustainability goals: promoting circularity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preventing waste leakages into the environment.HHI intends to be the leading recycling company to offer technology-enabled offerings and revolutionise the recycling landscape, in the future.Besides that, he said, HHI is pioneering a digital platform that will maximise value for its stakeholders in the plastic recyclables collection value chain.“The journey of the recyclable waste will be shared with the consumers to highlight the impact created by their contribution.“The key goals of HHI digital platform, or the HHI smart recycling app, includes educating the general public on importance and basics of recycling, increasing participation and engagement, leading to increase in recycling volumes, as well as optimising value chain logistics,” he added.Seah thanked MATRADE for the strong support given in developing HHI’s competitive advantage and equip them with relevant tools to position themselves as the global player in the plastics industry.He highlighted that the Mid-Tier Companies Development Programme (MTCDP) by MATRADE helped the company to strengthen its core business function. For the record, HHI was the participant in Wave 5, MTCDP in 2017.“Throughout the Mid-Tier Market Immersion Programme, HHI is able to prove ourselves and stand out in the global market. For instance, we are one of the largest recycled plastic material supplier in Australia and New Zealand.”Through exporters development programme like MTCDP, MATRADE will be able to create more export champions and support the ongoing efforts by the Government in regenerating Malaysian economy, driving the growth of new sectors while striking the balance to ensure the socio-economic inclusiveness and sustainability.MATRADE is currently recruiting new participants for the programme. The MTCDP targets MTCs with annual revenues between RM50mil and RM500mil for manufacturing companies, while RM20mil to RM500mil for services companies.Interested companies are encouraged to contact midtier@matrade.gov.my for more details.\n",

      "WHILE the Covid-19 pandemic continues to cast a shadow on our daily lives, the Australian International School Malaysia (AISM) aims to provide students the opportunity to extend their potential and excel in their chosen paths.Founded some 20 years ago, AISM has pledged to offer full scholarships for its Year 9 and 10 students at the school.As one of the longest established international schools in the country, offering a dynamic Australian curriculum, this scholarship would cover 100% of students’ two-year tuition fees.It has made the scholarship available to any student who isn't currently enrolled at AISM and of the age equivalent to Year 9 in 2021 and 2022.Financing high achieversThe scholarship will be awarded to a limited number of applicants based on the strength of the student’s academic performance, co-curricular involvement, communication skills and character.The private international school, ranked amongst the top 20% of New South Wales Schools for the third year in a row, is also giving an exclusive offer of up to 75% enrolment fee waiver for new applications submitted before Aug 30, 2021.While the recent full movement control order (FMCO) has continued to challenge and change the lives of teachers, students and families, AISM has continued to embrace the rapidly shifting environment.Last year – with a highly qualified team of academic staff to guide its learners – AISM received the best Higher School Certificate (HSC) results outside of Australia last year with one of its students achieving the highest possible Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) score of 99.95.Adapting to the challenging changing environmentIn tandem with excellent teachers, AISM touts its learning programme, especially its 50/50 assessment approach.This approach places equal emphasis on examinations and school-based assessments as well as developing life skills and a growth mindset.This would encourage students to develop beyond the classrooms.Furthermore, the international school noted that learning has taken a new dimension in light of the pandemic, with classrooms extending into the students' homes.As the world's first certified Visible Learning school, alongside the Australian curriculum, AISM’s transition was smooth as it offered one of the best teaching and learning experiences to all students.Moreover, the school has adapted well to online learning as students have constant access to their teachers.Regarding the online learning programme in AISM, Junior School head Michelle Chaplin said: “We've actually found that our students have become more independent and take more ownership for their learning.”A parent to one of the Senior School students echoed that her daughter has developed a sense of independence, responsibility and gained organisation skills with the online learning.Meanwhile, parents who have been part of their child's journey throughout the transition have witnessed their child’s growth.A parent to one of the Junior School students said: “I’m really happy, I know if I’ve got a problem or can’t work something out, I can just message or send an email out and get a really quick reply, especially during the MCO.”For more information, visit https://www.aism.edu.my to speak to its admissions team and schedule a one-to-one virtual appointment. Alternatively, parents and students are encouraged to register interest in AISM’s scholarship here.\n",

      "The Institute of Transport Infrastructure for Smart Mobility at Universiti Teknologi Petronas advances research on transport systems to increase productivity, safety and security while reducing congestion, pollution and operating costs.AT the Institute of Transport Infrastructure for Smart Mobility (ITI) in Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP), researchers look at transport in the most general sense as the movement of people and commodities through roads, railways, airways and waterways in urban/suburban, or plantation, agriculture and offshore settings to access required services and facilities. Given the pressing demands for sustainability, this movement has to now take into account several factors.This is where smart mobility comes in. It’s a megatrend that considers the seamless movement of people and things from one point to another using any means of transport while also bearing in mind cost, efficiency and impact on the environment.Designing smart mobility solutions, whether it is to ferry large groups of people or transporting goods across challenging terrain, hinges on there being the necessary, supportive infrastructure.This is where the work of ITI comes in. Organised under the pillar of smart communities, research undertaken at the institute considers smart mobility through the integration of three main elements - infrastructure, vehicles and operations – to create on-demand personal, and materials mobility systems that increase productivity, safety and security while reducing congestion, pollution and operating costs.ITI director Prof Dr Abd Rashid Abd Aziz says the institute’s work encompasses three research clusters focusing on automotive and transportation, infrastructure monitoring and maintenance, diagnostic and reliability.Members of the multi-disciplinary institute hail from the electrical and electronics engineering, mechanical engineering and civil engineering departments – creating a rich and exciting research environment for prospective postgraduate students. The robust research culture at UTP – where 90% of academicians are principal investigators – means that postgraduate students often dive straight into a project.An added advantage for prospective postgraduate students is the research funding available. Each year, the institute receives RM3mil to RM5mil new research grants from the Higher Education Ministry, the Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry as well as the Petronas Group.“When students join a centre or group, with a professor leading the group, then they can be assured that they are part of that research ecosystem. For example, my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) students work alongside research officers and post-doctoral staff, collecting data and then using and analysing the data, which will then form part of their thesis,” he says, adding that these are most often industry-based projects. “So, this means that students are exposed to working with industry, and gain experience and knowledge from these interactions with industry.\"“For postgraduate students interested in doing something futuristic, for example securing a breakthrough, then this is the place for them,” he says, adding that the work is often pioneering. “In UTP, you have to ensure that whatever you are doing, be it fundamental or applied research, addresses the pain points of industry.”He points to the example of the study on water and diesel emulsion aimed at reducing pollution and improving fuel economy without compromising on the engine’s power output. This fundamental research project, he adds, will eventually lead to solutions for industry as well as address global emission and greenhouse gas emission issues.“We work with industry because they know what are the real pain points. The advantage that industry has of working with us is our facilities, manpower and the fundamental knowledge, all of which can be applied to solve their problems. So, it's more than trial and error but a scientific investigation,” he adds. Industry partners include those from the automotive, oil and gas, telecommunications and plantation sectors.Rich research environmentSome of the notable research projects undertaken include Dr Rashid’s own pet project on the use of the free piston linear generator as a future power source.“At the moment it’s an electric generator like the diesel gen-sets used at night markets but in the future this can be used as static power generation for electric vehicles charging infrastructure,” he says, not discounting the possibility that one day vehicles will pull into fuelling stations equipped with these generators to recharge their electric cars. “It can even be used as an on-board power unit,” he adds.The institute is also looking at autonomous mobility for the agriculture sector, specifically vehicles that can roam plantations autonomously while carrying out inspection and collection jobs or the spraying of pesticides.“We also have groups looking at developing communication tools based on the Internet of Things technology. One of the institute’s innovations is a people-locator tag, which has a transmitter and receiver and sub-protocol to determine a person’s location. So you can track the movement of your employees continuously in real time in a power plant or offshore platform for example, which is important for optimisation, security and safety.Organisations as well as hajj and umrah operators for example, have expressed interest in the innovation to track the movements of pilgrims in Mecca. In an emergency you can account for and know where your employees or people are,” he says, disclosing that the research group is already in talks with a company to commercialise the product.Given the pioneering work undertaken at the institute, it’s not surprising that it boasts cutting-edge facilities. The Centre for Automotive Research and Electric Mobility (CAREM) for example, is equipped with a high-speed digital camera, which is able to image flame development in a combustion chamber. With up to 0.5 million frames per second (fps) capability (compared to a handphone that can only record up to 30 fps), the camera is able to capture the evolution of a flame.“This is important to test how good a fuel is and make the necessary improvements because the faster the flame burns the faster the energy is produced so the better the engine performance. So students can use these same facilities for their research,” he says, adding that the research facilities are also used by the institute’s global industry collaborators.UTP, which is ranked 70th in the QS Asia University Rankings 2021 also has a high ratio of international community among the staff and students. This offers postgraduate students a unique global intellectual and cultural experience.For more information on UTP’s postgraduate programmes, visit www.utp.edu.my\n",

      "THE hospitality sector took a big hit when the Covid-19 pandemic hit globally. Many employees were retrenched, and hotels and restaurants went under within a year.The tourism industry came to a standstill, especially after the closure of international borders.Despite these restrictions, as well as strict physical distancing and other uncertainties brought about by the pandemic, the global outlook for the hospitality sector is expected to take a turn for the better.According to the Hotel Insights’ Q2 2021 report, the demand for leisure is expected to recover rapidly resume as the Covid-19 vaccination rollout gathers pace around the world, including in Malaysia.The mass vaccination in many countries has enabled high-profile events that would encourage large crowds, such as the English Premier League, to take place albeit with strict health and safety guidelines.In anticipation of sectors picking up pace, UCSI University’s Faculty of Hospitality and Tourism Management is doing its part to provide a revolutionary education experience for students across the globe.Ranking that mattersThe Faculty of Hospitality and Tourism Management has been ranked as one of the top 100 schools for hospitality and leisure management in the QS World University Rankings By Subject 2021.Evidently, the ranking came from the faculty’s dedication to delivering top-quality expertise and skilled human capacity development, as well as having a tremendous academic front with sufficient industry knowledge.The faculty is a hub of discovery. Its presence in Kuala Lumpur and Kuching – two of Malaysia’s most popular tourist destinations – sees it providing a unique and diverse learning experience.Young, vibrant and innovative, the faculty is a place where aspiring hoteliers and restaurant managers obtain a comprehensive understanding of key industry practices and the underlying assumptions that make them work.Emphasising teamwork, leadership and service etiquette, the programmes leverage various learning approaches – experiential, collaborative, and discovery – that hone students’ analytical and decision-making skills.The programmes offer valuable lessons in teamwork, leadership and service etiquette through experiential learning, collaborative learning and discovery learning approaches.The aim is to develop talent with the right attitude for analytical and decision-making skills in preparation for co-operative structured internship programmes with top global industry players, as well as future senior management and executive positions.Global partnershipUCSI currently partners with the world-leading Hotel Management Institute, HTMi Switzerland.This strategic partnership offers students the best of both worlds in terms of affordability and the opportunity to enjoy HTMi Switzerland’s global network of career network services, mobility and internships.Award-winning studentsStudents from the faculty have won both local and international competitions.Chai Weng Yan, Lee Pei Shan and Teh Xin Ee, who are all third-year students pursuing the Bachelor of Hospitality Administration programme, recently placed third in HTMi’s Student Forum 2021 Innovation Challenge.They were the only Malaysian team to be named among the top three in the international contest.Another team comprising students Lu Heng Wu, Kenny Lai Chee Chiang and Tay Pui Yee won the cooking category at the World Skills Malaysia Sarawak 2019.For more information, visit www.ucsiuniversity.com.my or call 03-9101 8882 or 011-3592 0893.

      "IN facing the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, policymakers, scientists, medical staff, and IT and data specialists are flooded with terabytes of pandemic and case history data.As a consequence, they now face the demanding task of analysing voluminous data for policy formulation, decision making, predicting and managing future outbreaks.Fortunately, new-wave technologies such as IR4.0 (4th Industrial Revolution) which include data analytics, AI and intelligent and connected devices have come to the rescue to manage the pandemic disruption globally.In tandem with this, there is now more than ever a critical need for skilled resources to manage this often complex and interlinked web of systems and data.Conceivably, soon we will see technologies that are integrated and enable medical stakeholders to communicate with each other more efficiently – for rapid decisions and interventions with a lesser human physical dependency to save more lives.Quoting the Ministry of International Trade and Industry’s (MITI) national “Industry4WRD” policy, “Industry Revolution 4.0 (IR4.0) is blurring the distinction among physical, digital and biological spaces.”⁽¹⁾Digital skills in demandThe current dynamic and disruptive environment requires those involved to be equipped with the know-how, knowledge and skills to implement and manage the relevant, as it embodies advanced knowledge on integration of data, artificial intelligence, machines and communication.According to the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report, 50% of all employees will need reskilling by 2025.⁽²⁾Therefore, it is anticipated that reskilling and upskilling budgets of enterprises and organisations are likely to increase to meet the skills gap.In addition, future graduates will need to be equipped with a qualification that incorporates future-proof, employable skills that will serve them competently within their organisations and also contribute to society and the nation as the need arises.LinkedIn – the world's largest professional network on the Internet – predicts there will be 150 million new technology jobs globally in the next five years.⁽³⁾Adding to this, the Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint 2021 highlighted that the digital economy will become the foundation of the modern economy ⁽⁴⁾, thus requiring skilled manpower to fulfil this national mandate.Path to acquiring digital skillsTaking a lead in digital transformation for higher education, all academic programmes offered by Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation (APU) are technology-driven in all fields, tapping into the Internet of Things (IoT), data science, cybersecurity, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), mechatronics, e-business, digital marketing, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), digital leadership, finance technology (FinTech) and mobile technology.For working professionals and organisations, customised reskilling and upskilling programmes are offered.This strategy is very much in response to the greater demand for technology and innovation, driven by the new challenges people are facing under the new normal in Covid-19 times. It encompasses innovative teaching and learning by using state-of-the-art infrastructure, revolutionary programmes for the future, industry-academic partnership and professional development with a global outlook.To enable students to gain hands-on experiences, APU is equipped with world-class infrastructure from the United States, France, Singapore, Germany and the United Kingdom.APU’s industry on-campus exposes students, staff and training participants to a simulated working environment, real-time data and scenarios and real-time challenges. Some of APU’s significant industry partners include TechForte, Ministry XR, IBM, SAS, TIBCO, and Microsoft.One such industry-on-campus facility is the CyberSecurity Talent Zone (CSTZ) – the first of its kind integrated cybersecurity talent zone in Malaysia. CSTZ houses a military-grade real-time cybersecurity monitoring software at the full-fledged Cyber Threats Simulation & Response Centre (Cyber Range) and Security Operation Centre (SOC), where students can embrace and experience an industry or professional work setting, to grow as competent technology professionals in a real-world environment. Here they are able to hone their skills to identify, recognise and mitigate cybersecurity risks.In a first-of-its-kind collaboration with industry, APU established the first unique XR Studio in Asia and among Malaysian universities in collaboration with Ministry XR.The state-of-the-art studio comprises technologies, hardware and software capable of developing AR, VR and mixed reality (MR) applications. Students get hands-on experience developing industry-related projects revolving around computer games development, multimedia technology, engineering, animation and visual effects programmes.The state-of-the-art technology infrastructure, industry-on-campus, and industry experienced lecturers and professionals have formed a successful ecosystem that has helped develop future-proof, employable professionals.According to the latest Annual Graduate Tracer Study by the Higher Education Ministry, 100% of APU graduates were employed upon graduation.APU is on the right path in nurturing highly sought after graduates with readily employable digital skills and providing opportunities for upskilling and reskilling for working professionals.⁽¹⁾ https://www.miti.gov.my/miti/resources/National%20Policy%20on%20Industry%204.0/Industry4WRD_Final.pdf⁽²⁾ https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/top-10-work-skills-of-tomorrow-how-long-it-takes-to-learn-them/⁽³⁾ https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/digital-ecommerce-jobs-linkedin-report/⁽⁴⁾ https://www.epu.gov.my/sites/default/files/2021-02/malaysia-digital-economy-blueprint.pdf\n",

      "THERE can be no compromise on corruption. This is the message Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Mohd Zuki Ali sent out to the civil service in April this year.Corruption has the far-reaching potential to bring about deterioration in the highest levels of government and cause nations to fall.According to a World Bank report, countries with a high level of corruption have one-third the average income, three times the infant mortality rate and 25% literacy lower than countries with lower levels of corruption.In line with the National Anti-Corruption Plan (NACP) 2019-2023, all government ministries shall obtain the Anti-Bribery Management Systems (ABMS) certification from SIRIM QAS International.Fighting Corruption in the Public SectorAccording to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), 2, 607 civil servants were arrested for corruption from 2015 to October 2020.Meanwhile, the 2018 Transparency International Malaysia (TIM) estimated that corruption cost Malaysia 4% of its GDP every year since 2013 – about RM212.3bil lost because of graft over five years.Another point of concern is Malaysia’s drop in rankings – from 51 in 2019 to 56 in 2020 – in the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index (TI-CPI). Given that Malaysia climbed 10 steps from 61 in 2018 to 51 in 2019, the drop needs to be redressed.The private sector’s roles and responsibilitiesPrivate sector corruption also has serious consequences.For instance, corruption in public sector procurement often involves offering gratification to civil servants for a favourable decision. Therefore, the contracted company may not be the best in terms of service and/or price.KPMG's 2013 Fraud, Bribery and Corruption Survey indicated 90% of respondents in Malaysia said bribery and corruption were the biggest problem for businesses.In 2020, the Corporate Liability provision under Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Amendment Act 2018 came into force.This provision requires organisations to proactively prevent corruption in their processes by making directors and managers liable to prosecution for acts of corruption committed on behalf of the company, whether officially or unofficially.No longer is ignorance a viable defence, as the provision requires directors and managers to not only prove they are unaware of the corrupt act, but had taken all due diligence to ensure it does not occur.ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems (ABMS)The ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems (ABMS) enables organisations to equip themselves with the necessary tools and knowledge to identify, prevent and respond to bribery risks.Being certified by the ABMS enables organisations to demonstrate their commitment to inculcate a culture of transparency and integrity, which will further enhance trust and confidence in them.For private sector organisations, ABMS will strengthen their internal processes to safeguard against violations of the Corporate Liability provision.As for the public sector, it will safeguard important processes, plug leakages and wastages of public money and help build public trust.SIRIM QAS International – a trusted partnerA wholly-owned subsidiary of SIRIM Berhad and Malaysia’s leading testing, inspection and certification (TIC) body, SIRIM QAS is ready to help organisations demonstrate their commitment to the fight against corruption.SIRIM QAS is the first and only certification body (CB) accredited for the MS ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems (ABMS) by the Department of Standards Malaysia (DSM).As the national CB, SIRIM QAS has over 30 years of experience in providing conformity assessment services to Malaysian and foreign organisations, and boasts a highly experienced talent pool of auditors.Accreditation from DSM further enhances the credibility of its certifications.Since 2017, SIRIM QAS has served 37 ministries and government agencies to receive certification. Given that there are over 700 ministries and agencies, the number of current organisations certified with ABMS is worryingly low.Part of the reason could be a lack of understanding about the certification process and implementation.With the recent announcement by the Chief Secretary, ministries and agencies should ramp up efforts to get ABMS certified.Organisations may seek assistance in preparing their processes to be ABMS-ready from a professional training service provider such as SIRIM STS – a leading training provider for many types of certification including the ABMS.\n",

      "IN February 2021, the government launched the Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint aimed at transforming Malaysia into a regional leader in digital economy with a RM70bil investment in digitalisation by 2025 with the digital economy expected to eventually contribute 22.6% of the nation’s GDP.It aims to achieve 100% household access to the Internet to enable students to access online learning and create 500, 000 new jobs by 2025.Initiatives will be implemented to increase the number of start-ups to 5, 000 while pushing for the adoption of eCommerce by at least 875, 000 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by 2025.In light of this ambitious blueprint, HELP University offers two programmes in data analytics to contribute to fulfilling the manpower needs required for its realisation.The BIT (Hons) Data Analytics offered by School of Information and Communication Technology aims to fulfil the high industry demand for business and data analysts by producing graduates with an understanding of the business challenges of an enterprise, and who are able to conceive and manage solutions that are increasingly data-driven.Students are trained in the latest data analytics methods and tools. They will be able to consult on, support or develop the technological platforms of an enterprise to achieve a competitive advantage, and build a career in roles ranging from data and systems analysts to data engineers and data scientists.The programme includes topics such as fundamental and advanced statistical and mathematical principles (the basis of advanced data analysis techniques), machine learning, pattern recognition, data mining, big data technologies, data visualisation and enterprise data infrastructure.Commenting on the programme, head of the School of Information and Communication Technology Dr Tang U-Liang said: “Data scientists are highly sought-after by organisations which need skilled individuals who can use advanced analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a sustainable value chain from enterprise data to decision-making in the boardroom. The ultimate aim is to contribute to raising efficiency and productivity in the service of the digital economy\".Dr Tang, who holds a PhD from the National University of Singapore, is a data scientist with extensive experience of applied research using AI and ML tools.To add to the value of their study experience, students are offered a joint certificate of competency in the application of SAS tools for descriptive and predictive analytics. This is in collaboration with SAS, the leading analytics software developer.Complementing the BIT (Hons) Data Analytics offered by HELP is the Bachelor of Business Analytics (BBA) (Hons) offered by the Faculty of Business, Economics and Accounting (FBEA).Business analytics aims to provide solutions to business problems and to improve business performance by using statistical analysis and modelling to explore and investigate business data to transform data into business insights. These insights are then used to predict outcomes of business decisions and to recommend actions that maximise ideal outcomes.Graduates are nurtured to assume management and marketing positions such as business analyst, operations research analyst, market research analyst, operations analyst, quantitative analyst, project manager and digital marketing manager.They will acquire a good knowledge of the discipline of business as well as a data-driven capability to enable them to generate statistical outputs using analytical tools and techniques, interpret them and make effective managerial decisions.Topics include programming, database systems, business analytics and information systems, business analytics for decision-making, marketing analytics, HR analytics, descriptive, predictive, prescriptive analytics, business analytics, and data insights and visualisations.They are also given practice in live stock-trading using Bloomberg business resources and facilities in HELP’s RM25mil Business Analytics and Technology Innovation Centre (BATIC).According to the course leader Dr Melody Tan, the BBA is targeted directly to fulfil the enormous demand and need for trained Business Analysts to boost business and productivity.“It strengthens our capability as the leading business school to nurture skills and professionalism to contribute to the digital economy\".Dr Tan used a data science methodology - social network analysis - to study the movie series Stargate and Star Trek for her PhD thesis. This complements the skills in bibliometric and citation analysis of data she acquired as a postgraduate student at Universiti Malaya.To further enhance students’ skills, a Data and Business Analytics Certificate Course is offered free to all students. They also receive mentorship in data analytics and e-entrepreneurship through HELP’s collaboration with the Alibaba Business School.HELP’s efforts in advancing data analytics and training have received recognition and endorsement from industry and governing bodies.Its programmes contribute to transforming HELP into an analytics-driven entrepreneurial university, for which Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) named HELP as a Premier Digital Tech Institution (PDTI), one of a handful of institutions to receive this honour.Admission into the BIT Data Analytics and BBA programmes for SPM, UEC and O-Level holders is through the Diploma in IT and Diploma in Business pathways, with credits in three subjects (Maths is compulsory for BIT).Currently HELP University is making access to its analytics programmes easier by offering micro-credentials to a wide community of students from high school to undergraduates and working adults.For more information, look out for the advertisement in this StarSpecial.\n",

      "AS we’re all aware, milk not only provides a good package of nutrients that children need while growing up, but is also a great way to get filling protein, which is important to maintain the immune system and muscles, while helping build, maintain and repair cells.But do you know what’s in the milk you drink?Today, most regular cow’s milk contains a combination of two main milk proteins known as the A1 and A2 milk proteins.Back in the day, however, it’s a different story, because over 5,000 years ago, cows naturally produced only A2 milk protein, defined as the original, complete source of protein containing natural carbohydrates for energy.But many would have never heard of A2 milk protein or have never known the benefits of this particular protein. In fact, A2 milk protein has become an extremely precious source - only 30% of cows worldwide are pure A2 cow breeds that produce pure A2 milk protein.That’s because a natural genetic mutation occurred somewhere along the way and most of our milk-producing friends started producing A1 milk protein as well.What are the differences between A1 & A2 milk protein?In a nutshell, the difference appears to boil down to digestion. A1 and A2 milk proteins only differ in structure by one amino acid, but that tiny variance may have a big impact on the way the protein is digested.Emerging evidence from studies in preschool children and adults suggest that milk with A2 milk protein is less likely to be associated with digestive discomfort - think a heavy or full stomach, bloating, abdominal pain and flatulence - after milk consumption1.Research shows that A2 milk containing only A2 milk protein is less associated with digestive discomfort1Making an informed choiceParents always want the best for their children and choosing the type of formula milk they drink is a big deal.For parents looking for natural children’s milk formula and some children may be sensitive to regular milk with A1 & A2 milk protein, Enfagrow A+ has formulated the new Enfagrow AII MindPro.

      "FRONTLINERS tending to Covid-19 patients at the quarantine and low-risk treatment centre (PKRC) at Malaysia Agro Exposition Park (MAEPS) in Serdang, Selangor, were treated to durian confectionary on June 11 courtesy of Hernan Corporation Sdn Bhd.A team from Hernan Corporation led by chief executive officer Anna Teo distributed RM150,000 worth of Musang King snowy cake, mochi and other delectable durian products to the frontliners.“All of us at Hernan Corporation are inspired by the selflessness and hard work of the nation’s frontliners,” said Teo.“With sheer determination and patience, they help each Covid-19 patient who walks through the door of MAEPS.“The world is watching, and Malaysians taking care of Malaysia – an embodiment of the community spirit and semangat kerjasama that we are famous for – continues to uplift us despite these trying times.”The Hernan team gave out 1,500 goodie bags of the durian treats.In response, PKRC MAEPS director Dr Shahabuddin Ibrahim said: “Durians are our national pride. Our devoted frontliners look forward to sharing these scrumptious treats with their family when they go home.”Established in 1996, Hernan Corporation is Malaysia's largest and leading exporter and manufacturer of Malaysian durian products – from frozen and fresh durians to durian foodstuff like mochi, pancake, cream puff, chocolate, mooncake and others.With multiple accreditations including halal compliance and FSSC certification, the company exports its products to more than 18 countries – among them China, the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia.\n",

      "THE University of Derby (UOD) 3+0 programme offered by the Department of Management Studies (DOMS) at the HELP Academy is a value proposition that many students aiming for an internationally recognised business degree from the UK find hard to resist.The programmes offered are the BA (Hons) Accounting and Finance, BA (Hons) Business Management and the BA (Hons) Business Management (International Business).These are supplemented by three diploma programmes and a certificate programme that provide a pathway for school leavers to enter the degree programmes. These are the Diploma in Accounting, Diploma in Business Management and Diploma in Marketing, and the Certificate in Business Management.UOD is a modern and innovative public university with a 170-year history. It grew from the Derby College of Art and Technology and is ranked among the top 30 UK universities by the Guardian University Guide 2020.Its other impressive credentials include being ranked among the top 10 UK universities for Business, Management and Marketing honours degree courses, and among the top 10 for Accounting and Finance honours courses (Guardian University Guide 2020).Students selecting the relevant module pathway will be given maximum exemptions by the ACCA to qualify for professional membership to accelerate their careers.Graduates of this programme have gone on to excel in local practice, multinational accounting firms, merchant banks and other major financial institutions and businesses.The BA (Hons) Business Management involves combining elements from diverse subjects (e.g. Management Principles, Managing Financial Resources, Business Economics, Understanding People in Organisations) and applying them in scenarios like setting up a business, identifying a target market, mounting an advertising campaign, and preparing business plans and cash flows.This kind of experience and practical application of knowledge make this a unique course to prepare graduates for a successful management career.The BA (Hons) Business Management (International Business) focuses on the way businesses work across the world and provides a solid foundation for those intent on a career in a multinational or an international business.Graduates will be highly employable in sectors like international trade, transport and logistics corporations, financial institutions involved with trade and investment, firms engaged with business process outsourcing, government agencies involved in international trade and international business consultancy.For admission into these three attractive degrees, the entry requirements are three credits in any subject for SPM (or equivalent) and B6 for UEC; except for the Diploma in Accounting, which must include Maths.Admission to the Certificate in Business Management only requires one credit in any subject in SPM (or equivalent) or B6 for UEC. This gives a significant advantage, as students can subsequently proceed to any of the above diploma courses and complete a UOD degree in four and a half years.The UOD Business Management and International Business degrees are accredited by the Chartered Management institute (CMI, UK) which is dedicated to nurturing management and leadership skills in professionals. Students registered in these two programmes at DOMS receive an added bonus: they are given Affiliate Membership of CMI during their studies, and on completion they receive a Diploma in Management and Leadership from the CMI.The Diploma in Management and Leadership (a CMI Level 5 qualification) is a comprehensive course designed to provide candidates all the skills and knowledge required of a senior manager; it normally takes 18 months to complete.One big attraction of the UOD degrees at DOMS is the 10-day trip to the UOD campus in the UK provided by HELP as an essential part of the programme.Students literally become part of the student body, participating in academic activities like lectures and seminars led by the UOD academic faculty; they meet and network with Derby students and faculty members, and visit the university’s industry partners like Rolls Royce. They also receive a warm welcome from the Mayor of Derby city.At leisure time, they visit London and other cities to shop and to appreciate the rich cultural heritage of England. The more enterprising and adventurous students organise side trips to parts of the UK and to European cities both before and after the study trip. This is an irresistible value proposition as their airfare is covered by the trip.Students testify to the value of the UOD programme with great enthusiasm.Raja Nur Syazwina (BA Hons Business Management with First Class Honours) says “One highlight is the mandatory industrial training which greatly enhanced my learning capabilities and analytical skills that ultimately led to my First Class Honours result”.Raja Nur Syazwina’s credentials helped her secure a job as an investment analyst at Amara Investment Management.Kelly Yap Pye Venn (BA Hons Accounting and Finance) admits: \"I like calculations and numbers, thus my interest in accounting and finance. It also opened doors to the corporate world. The free trip to the Derby campus in the UK was important for me; it was not just a vacation but also an exposure to the university, particularly the culture and the environment. This programme and the international study trip gave me many memorable experiences; it also reminds me there are many challenges out there for me to overcome, using the knowledge I have gained.\"For more information on programmes, call 03-2716 2000 or email marketing@help.edu.my\n",
