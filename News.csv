"Tuesday, 14 Sep 2021",,News,REBECCA RAJAENDRAM,Malaysian earns spot on Global Student Prize 2021,"PETALING JAYA: A 19-year-old’s efforts to leave a positive impact on youth entrepreneurship and financial literacy – while remaining on top of his studies – has won him a spot as one of the 50 finalists for the Global Student Prize 2021.Leong Yiq Zhenn (pic) said he was motivated to help other young people because of his own “traumatic experience” with bad financial planning and irrational business decisions that affected the lives and livelihoods of others.“I hope no other youth members would experience the feeling of keeping their head just above water,” he said.The Petaling Jaya boy beat over 3,500 nominations and applications from 94 countries to make it into the top 50 and was nominated by Junior Achievement (JA) Worldwide, an international youth-serving non-governmental organisation he joined in 2018.After completing his Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) exams and wearing many hats at JA Malaysia, he then focused on bringing digital innovation to their programmes.He developed a multi-vendor e-commerce platform, JAM Mall, to provide thousands of Malaysian high-school entrepreneurs a learning environment for digital marketing, online sales and data analytics.The platform, he added, processed orders worth more than RM48,000 in two months.He also designed and conducted workshops with a focus on e-commerce, data analysis, branding, and digital growth, impacting more than 41,000 students.Besides being involved in JA Worldwide, Yiq Zhenn has also won top community service awards in the Leo Club programme since joining it in Form One at SMK Bandar Utama Damansara 3.The awards included Leo Club Excellence Award and Leo of the Year 2018.While there, he worked to build up the club with monthly small-scale projects to expanding its community service.“Despite setbacks and lack of support, I tried to change the status quo of ‘how things used to work’ by expanding our community service scope and making existing initiatives bigger and better,” he said.If he wins the US$100,000 (RM415,450) award, Yiq Zhenn said he would donate a portion to JA Malaysia’s company programme for rural schools, another to JA Worldwide/Asia Pacific and use the rest to fund his higher education degree, majoring in economics, which he is currently pursuing at University of Calgary, Canada.The teenager hopes his nomination will inspire others to take part in similar initiatives to help Malaysia’s youth “which could then create an impact across society”.The Chegg.org Global Student Prize is a cash award presented to an exceptional student making a real impact on learning, the lives of their peers and on society beyond.Run by the London-based Varkey Foundation, it is open to all students who are at least 16 years old and enrolled in an academic institution or training and skills programme.The top 10 finalists will be announced in October.The Global Student Prize, and its sister prize, Global Teacher, also organised by the foundation, offer inspirational stories from both sides of the education divide."
"Tuesday, 14 Sep 2021",,Opinion,PROF DR MOHD TAJUDDIN MOHD RASDI,A great Malaysian tragedy,"THIS is one article that I didn’t want to write. I put off writing it for two years. Writing 900 words about this subject was more painful than taking three years to write a 100,000-word thesis. I would do three more theses if I could avoid writing these next 900 words.This article is about a tragedy that concerns us as a people and a nation. The tragedy should have sparked a national debate, but it was ignored despite being repeated four times.What is this great tragedy, you might ask? Is it the May 13 race riots in 1969? Is it the Bukit Kepong incident in 1950? Is it the first riot in 1964 in Singapore before it left the federation? Is it the fall of a government? Or is it the dismal state of our institutions of education, justice and administration?To me, all of these things combined fail to measure up to the tragedy I am about to describe.Two years ago I happened to read a news article about an Indian-Malaysian family whose father killed all of his children. The report related how the mother died of cancer a few days before and the father, who was jobless and also in poor health, had become distraught. He ended up killing his 15-year-old son and three other children by strangling them all. After that horrifying deed, he hanged himself.I could not sleep well for several days after reading about that, wondering why a father would kill his children. What drove him to do that? The police and other authorities dismissed it as the act of a crazy man. I did not think so.Two weeks later, there was a report of another destitute Indian-Malaysian family whose parent, also suffering from an illness, killed the children. Again, the authorities dismissed it as “orang gila punya kerja” (a mad person’s act).Several months later, I read of Chinese-Malaysian parents who poisoned their four little children and then themselves. At the last minute, an ambulance was called, but all the children died; the parents survived.And just last week, a penniless father, whose race was not stated, smothered his three children after his wife died.After each of these cases, our nation went on with business as usual. No professors from our 200 universities raised the issue. No religious clerics from any religion made it into a social and political issue. No NGO stood up and demonstrated or wrote press statements about the tragedies.Was I the only one who cringed at the news of parents killing their children? Was I the only one to ask questions?Firstly, why did these parents not seek help from other family members? All of us have wider family circles and if we begged several of them to care for one child each, surely they would respond? I have no issue whatsoever if adults decide to take their own lives, but I am aghast and crushed when children are killed just because one cannot figure out how to feed and care for them.All children in this country – and the world – should be cared for and given a minimum chance to survive until they can make their own way. Is that not a social, political and spiritual right? What happened to the larger family system if parents think that it would burden other family members?Then I asked the question: why did the parents not seek help from the leaders of their own race or religion? We have political leaders of all races and houses of worship worth millions. What is the purpose of religion and these splendid displays of architectural feats if parents had no faith that they could get help from going to a church, a mosque, a temple or a gurdwara to ask congregants to help their children?If I were the parent, I would have taken them to the mosque and begged for help and asked to stay at the mosque. I would help sweep the floor of the mosque or scrub its toilets and then ask restaurants for leftovers so I could feed my children and myself. There is no shame in that. But, of course, I would ask for help from my own family and wife’s family first before going that far.Finally, I asked: what should our government do for such families? Why did the four families not go to a zakat office or the Welfare Department for help? Why did they have no confidence in our institutions, orphanages and other forms of welfare? What are these zakat or welfare officers doing? Why are they not proactively walking the streets and looking under bridges for the homeless or talking to people in low-cost flats to see if there are families facing destitution?I wish the four families had reached out to the media or someone for help instead of killing their children. What does it say about our nation when parents kill their children instead of trusting our institutions of race, institutions of religion and institutions of governance?When I was in the United Kingdom, I was given a financial allowance for my four children. When I was in the United States, I was given food stamps when my daughter was born. I also remember watching a report on YouTube about 400,000 unemployed British youngsters given £250 (about RM1,400 at current rates) a month as a benefit back then.I spent nine years overseas and I never read about parents killing their children because of poverty. What does it say about our country, our people and our faiths when four tragedies like these can happen – and that they raised not one iota of concern? We are, truly and sadly, a nation that is failing its most vulnerable people.Prof Dr Mohd Tajuddin Mohd Rasdi is Professor of Architecture at UCSI University.

"Tuesday, 14 Sep 2021",3:04 PM MYT,Opinion,COMMENT,"Undergarments advert ban lacks reasonability, Film Censorship Board must explain and announce SOP","THE Film Censorship Board should have exercised restraint when it instructed two local TV stations to stop displaying visuals of men's and women's undergarments in their home shopping segments. Their directive lacked reasonability.The Film Censorship Board must explain and clarify the relevant SOPs so that businesses may operate in accordance with regulations and work without interruption.At the same time, disciplinary action must be taken against the related officers for creating their own rules and discretions, but contribute nothing to assuage the situation.The affected broadcaster did not display any indecent visuals – its models and mannequins were not arranged to exhibit obscene behaviour of donning undergarments.Accusing the company that ""any indecent visual displays, including advertising 'undergarments' will still offend the community"" is far-fetched, and will not convince the public.On the contrary, the officers' actions will cause the public to suspect that they were bent on fault-finding and deliberately making things difficult.If not handled properly, their demeanour will backfire and cause a mockery of our nation's reputation.Malaysia allows licenced businesses to sell and promote products. So long as the advertised products do not involve obscenity or violate the law – particularly with e-commerce currently booming – there are various platforms for innovative methods.As long as manufacturers and retailers exercise self-discipline and operate within the scope of the law, this is the inevitable trend for innovation and e-commerce.With the raging Covid-19 pandemic, Malaysian businesses have suffered a serious blow in sales and income and many have wound up.Amidst such challenges and pressures, going online to publicise one's products is the best solution to adapt to in the current situation.Unfortunately, despite the financial difficulties, there are overzealous officers who are adding salt to the wound.This will not only cause public resentment, but also contravene the government's policy of fully promoting economic recovery.Datuk Heng Seai Kie is Wanita MCA national chairperson"

"Wednesday, 15 Sep 2021",,Food,JADE CHAN,Dining amid hornbills,"SARAWAK’S state bird, the rhinoceros hornbill, features prominently at the charming Hornbill Restaurant and Cafe next to the main entrance of KL Bird Park.Over here, the large bird even occasionally wings in to sit by diners.The restaurant overlooks the bird park’s hornbill zone, so lucky diners can spot the rhinoceros hornbill flying among the greenery or perching on the balcony of the verandah.The nearly two decades old restaurant is open to park visitors and non-visitors alike. It reopened recently to dine-in customers, while the bird park has reopened under Kuala Lumpur’s Phase Two of the National Recovery Plan.Because of its proximity to the Parliament building and Bukit Aman police headquarters, diners should not be surprised to see Members of Parliament huddled together here for a discussion or police officers tucking into their meals.Hornbill Restaurant features timbered kampung architecture and its verandah overlooks the lush greenery of the bird park, thus the setting is one of dining within a green oasis in the city.It offers a variety of dishes from Asian and Western cuisines, with the menu already tweaked over time to continue attracting returning and new customers.“Our menu has undergone several changes since the restaurant opened sometime between 2002 and 2003,” said chef Qamarul Baharudin Idris, 51, who heads the kitchen team.“For example, the chicken chop used to have a breadcrumb coating but now it is grilled.“About five years ago, we came up with a menu offering light bites such as curry puffs, pisang goreng and keropok lekor so customers could have snacks as well, instead of just heavy meals.”The restaurant pays homage to the Land of the Hornbills with its Sarawak laksa, which comes topped with prawns, shredded chicken and fresh coriander.“The soup base for this dish is made using a special paste from Sarawak,” said Qamarul.“It was also introduced to afford foreign customers a taste of a traditional dish from the state.”A personal favourite is the fried mee mamak. The noodle dish stir-fried with prawns, fish cake, chicken fillet and beansprouts comes with a sambal dip made using Qamarul’s secret recipe.Other best-selling Asian dishes include satay (beef and chicken), Oriental fried rice, nasi lemak, Penang char kuey teow and Nasi Goreng Malaysia.The popular Western dishes are chicken chop, fish and chips, grilled lamb cutlet, spaghetti carbonara and the Club Sandwich. Hornbill Restaurant’s menu also offers soups, salads and desserts.The snacks are priced from RM5.90. Asian dishes are from RM14.90 and Western dishes start at RM15.90.“Our Asian and Western best-sellers are popular with both local diners and foreign tourists,” said Qamarul, referring to pre-Covid-19 times.“Tourists who are familiar with Asian flavours will enjoy the local dishes such as nasi lemak and fried mee mamak. Those who have less adventurous taste buds stick to Western favourites such as chicken chop and pasta.”To quench the thirst after spending a day traipsing all over the bird park, diners can indulge in a refreshing coconut drink or opt for fresh fruit juices that contain no added sugar.Safari Bird Park and Wonderland marketing and promotions executive Taufik Mohd Sharif said the premises occupied what was previously a fast food restaurant.The new management that took over the spot decided to open a restaurant that would complement this tourist attraction.Hornbill Restaurant is open for dine-in to fully vaccinated diners.

"Wednesday, 15 Sep 2021",,News,REBECCA RAJAENDRAM,Varsities open for admission,"PETALING JAYA: Campuses across the nation will reopen on Oct 15 with tighter standard operating procedures but only for fully vaccinated students and staff.At the same time, Higher Education Minister Datuk Dr Noraini Ahmad said the ministry would give a 20% fee reduction worth RM175mil to benefit 555,340 public higher education institution students for Semester One of the 2021/2022 academic session to ease their financial burden.“The admission of fully vaccinated students into the higher education institutions (HEIs) involves all categories of students and all National Recovery Plan phases with priority given to students in need,” she said yesterday during the announcement of the SOP for HEIs.Students in need include those who are required to do clinical or practical training, or access to facilities available only on campus.A person is considered fully vaccinated 14 days after receiving the second dose of either the Pfizer, AstraZeneca or Sinovac vaccines, or 28 days after one dose of the Johnson & Johnson or CanSino vaccines.Noraini said students who could not be vaccinated because of health reasons should contact their respective institutions for coordination.“The numbers allowed on campus depend on the campus’ capacity and those present will have to adhere to strict SOP to curb the spread of the virus.“This is a step towards ensuring the environment is safe and herd immunity on campus,” she said.Noraini said 66% of students and 90% of HEI academic and non-academic staff were currently fully vaccinated with the ministry projecting to have everyone fully vaccinated by the end of October.She added that the ministry was working with the Covid-19 Immunisation Taskforce (CITF) to speed up the vaccine rates for the campus fraternity before HEIs open their gates next month.“Therefore, I call on all HEIs students and staff who have not yet been vaccinated to do so immediately,” she said, adding that they could walk into any vaccination centre.“They just need to show their student or staff card and their MyKad.”New students will need to present their MyKad together with their offer letter.Those returning to campuses in Peninsular Malaysia only require a permission letter from their HEIs while HEIs in Sabah, Sarawak and Labuan are subject to the SOP enforced by the respective state governments.“Students must obtain a permission letter to cross state/district from the Royal Malaysia Police and must undergo the RT-PCR swab test,” said Noraini.The test can be done for free at government health clinics for students.She also said HEIs were encouraged to set up isolation centres to manage those with Covid-19 symptoms.“Hybrid learning will continue even when campuses resume operations.“For courses or programmes conducted online, students can choose to learn online in their respective localities.“Activities involving laboratories, workshops, studios and research (on campus) can be carried out in groups, guided by the established SOP,” said Noraini."

These are the group of students who will be joining pre-university courses, such as foundation and diploma.“Even if most students or all students are vaccinated, we still cannot allow all of them to return due to the SOP and each HEIs capacity,” said its president Elajsolan Mohan, adding that HEIs must ensure that those outside the HEI ecosystem, such as vendors and visitors, must be fully vaccinated before they are allowed in the campus. This is to create a ‘campus bubble’,” he added.Universiti Putra Malaysia deputy vice-chancellor (academic and international) Prof Dr M. Iqbal Saripan said the varsity will be allowing students back to campus in three phases, based on the updated SOP.UPM’s 2021/2022 academic year, he said, starts on Oct 18.“In the first phase, we will allow 25% of students to be on campus; these are clinical students, interns, teaching practicums, students who need to use the Internet and those who require special assistance in their learning.“Phase two will be in mid-November, where another 35% will be allowed back. These are students who require labs, studios and on-site work.“Meanwhile, the last phase will begin in mid-December where another 10%-20% will be allowed back,” he said, adding that the rest will continue studying online."
"Wednesday, 15 Sep 2021",,News,,FOCUS ON HIGH VALUE-ADDED ACTIVITIES,"KUALA LUMPUR: As competition in the international timber industry intensifies, it is crucial for Malaysia’s timber players to focus on high value-added offerings as they look into diversifying products and services, which would enable them to tap into new opportunities for growth, said Malaysian Furniture Council (MFC) secretary-general Matthew Law.While recognising the challenges that the industry has faced as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Law said that timber and timber-related companies can begin recouping market share lost during the total lockdown of movement control order 3.0.“Furniture is one of the largest contributors to the export for the timber industry. We will not be phased out as it’s an industry that will always remain [in the market],” he said, pointing to the RM12bil in timber exports for the first half of the year, in which furniture was the top contributor at RM5.54bil, despite the country embroiled in the pandemic.Law also attributes the demand for furniture to differing consumer behaviour in different markets including the US or the United Kingdom, where it is the norm for households and businesses alike to change furniture every three to five years.Notably with the continued trade tensions between the United States and China, alongside the supply chain disruption at the height of the pandemic, countries are increasingly realising the risks in potential gaps caused by the crisis and are taking steps to diversify their supply chain for business continuity.He added, “China is one of the world’s major suppliers, but customers won’t put everything in crisis and local companies can leverage on the gaps in the global supply chain.“With our stable base of trustworthy and reliable manufacturers and the skills that we have, Malaysia is definitely one of the countries ready to take on that aspect.”On the other hand, there is also rising competition from Eastern European countries such as Poland, which is geographically closer to those markets and has relatively lower wages compared to Malaysia.Tackling challengesFor Law, who also has his own company, plans for the short term are to implement suitable standard operating procedures with extra measures to minimise business disruptions – such as those relating to enclosed areas, physical contact and safety precautions – as well as to encourage healthier lifestyles among staff members to ensure they are ready to tackle opportunities in the market.That said, he admits that there are challenges lying ahead, with varying economic activity recovery levels in different states meaning that supply chains are still not back to normal, as companies adhere to regulations to operate at capacity in tandem with full vaccination rates.“The second challenge is for export. Although freight rates have increased to a range of 250% to 300%, there’s no container space for us. So, we have to check with customers beforehand whether they’re able to secure containers, which affects production as well,” he said.Another major issue lies with market volatility due to the ongoing pandemic, which directly impacts credit terms and cash flow management issues.Despite the looming obstacles, Law believes that industry players have to continue staying positive and swiftly implement strategies and processes for continuous improvement, in order to remain competitive on the global stage.He opines, “Our industry players must look beyond mass production to focus on high value-added products. The sector also must be ready to ramp up capacity to the next level and embrace the implementation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to future-proof their businesses, instead of solely relying on foreign workers.“It’s about digitising and automating where possible to be prepared to tap into new opportunities, be it engineering, software, or machinery.“Although the more labour-intensive aspects such as stitching and upholstery still require manual work, when it comes to panelling and solid woods, it’s possible.”At the same time, he cautions industry players to learn from their experience during Covid-19 to not only diversify products with an eye on adding value, but also exploring more markets for growth.Stressing that sustainability practices are the future for the industry, Law said that Malaysia’s timber industry is ready to meet such requirements.This is in order to cater to growing demand, due to the rising trend of customers in well-developed countries outside of the US, UK and Europe – like Singapore and Japan, for instance – becoming more aware and discerning when it comes to choosing environmentally friendly products."

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",,News,,INTERACTIVE: The Bahasa in Malaysia,"OUR national language Bahasa Malaysia is an important factor that binds Malaysians from all walks of life together.While Bahasa Malaysia is our lingua franca, there are many loghat or dialects that are shared and spoken throughout the states in the country.These days, young Malaysians are breathing new life to state Malay dialects on social media such as Instagram, Tik Tok and YouTube.One such person is Wee Yun Nee, 24, from Kuala Lumpur. The content creator produces fun and quirky videos where she speaks the Kelantanese dialect.""It all started with an Instagram Story I did with my brother. In the video, we switched from speaking in Hokkien to loghat Kelantan,"" she said.That video went viral and since then, Wee – who's affectionately known as Mek Yun on social media – has created more content highlighting the Kelantanese dialect.Her videos range from basic vocabulary lessons to sketches featuring her family members, who all speak fluent loghat Kelantan.Both of Wee's parents hail from Kelantan and she learned the dialect in school while living in the state for three years before moving back to KL.PlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time00:20Toggle MuteVolumeToggle Fullscreen""I love speaking loghat Kelantan because it feels close to home and heart. It's very different from normal Malay word because different pronunciation can give different meaning,"" she said.Wee hopes more Malaysians will continue to speak their respective state dialect to prevent the language from disappearing.""Our dialects is one of the identities that is very hard to replace. If we do not practise them, they might not be inherited and passed on to future generations,"" she said.In the early days of our independence, the Malay language was chosen as the national language of the nation as it has been spoken for centuries by early inhabitants residing here, including the traders who came from India, China, Persia, and countries from Middle East and Europe for trading purposes.Chances are the majority of Malaysians nowadays converse in bahasa baku (standardised Malay language) that is also used in formal and official situations.Linguists have warned that the number dialect speakers are dwindling as those from the younger generation tend to switch to bahasa baku.According to Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), there are 13 distinct Malay dialects in Malaysia, including Sabah and Sarawak.Some researches have also pointed out the existence of sub-dialects among these dialects, such as the Ulu Terengganu sub-dialect in Terengganu and the Pekan sub-dialect in Pahang.The main differences of the various Malay dialects are found in the vocabulary, intonation, grammar and structure in sentences.The Negri Sembilan dialect, according to studies, has lexical similarity to standard Malay and is a variant of the Minangkabau language.PlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time00:23Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenMeanwhile, loghat Kelantan is usually spoken with words that end with 'a', 'o' or 'e'.The Terengganu dialect is characterised by the emphasis on the pronunciation of the letter ‘g’.PlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time00:15Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenElsewhere, the Sarawak Malay dialect has many vocabularies that are different from standard Malay.

There seems to exist close proximity among these dialects.""There is also a report saying that the Pahang dialect also has similarities with Kelantan and Terengganu dialects, especially in their vocabulary,"" he said in an interview.Nathesan, however, warned that the number of dialect speakers are dwindling these days as standardised Malay are increasingly preferred by the younger generation.PlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time00:26Toggle MuteVolumeToggle Fullscreen""The number of speakers of these dialects is dwindling as only the elders are able speak the dialects while the younger generation are not conversant enough in these dialects.""This could be due to the fact that the standard Malay language is more predominantly used by the younger people in their educational domain and also in their social interactions among their peers,"" he said.The upside is that there has been a growing number of young Malaysians who are keen to preserve their state's dialect.Wee argued that young Malaysians are eager to learn the state dialect and social media has made it easier for them to do so.""Almost everyone has social media now and I realise people are very eager to learn the dialect,"" she said.Finance student Sayangku Athirah Puteri Mohd Rapi, 23, has also been highlighting her state dialect, loghat Pahang, on social media.PlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time00:18Toggle MuteVolumeToggle Fullscreen""The loghat Pahang is one of the most underrated dialects in the country.

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",,Food,ABIRAMI DURAI,New documentary series highlights Penang's famed food culture and food vendors,"A few years ago, fresh graduate Robert Chua Ka Sin, 25, picked up a camera, learnt how to shoot and began a love affair with film-making. Upon returning to his hometown of Penang, Chua met young audio engineering graduate Goh Soo Ghee. The two became firm friends and decided to open their own production house, called Robert Visuals just before the pandemic began early last year.During the pandemic, Chua came across an article written about James Beard award-winning Malaysian-born filmmaker Andrew Gooi who had set up the US-based Food Talkies, a website for culinary films. That sparked an idea to document the stories of some of Penang’s most venerated, multi-generational street food vendors.“I was inspired to do this because it’s a pandemic and there’s a real danger that these local street food businesses and vendors will close down completely, like many other businesses have and then their stories will be lost forever. So it is important to document this before it disappears altogether and we wanted to do our bit to preserve local culture through food stories.“And another thing we realised when we looked online at other food films and videos was that a lot of what was being covered was just about the food itself; it wasn’t about the people and the stories behind the food.“I feel this is very unfortunate, because other countries like Singapore and France celebrate their chefs and street vendors with good films and documentaries, whereas there is very little of this in Penang and Malaysia. It doesn’t feel fair and I thought if I could contribute the time to doing this, it would be worth it,” says Chua.A worthwhile undertakingSo began a passion project that took a full year to come to fruition, because Chua and Goh funded it themselves and had to take on paying jobs in between the completion of this endeavour. They also roped in Gooi, whom they contacted through Instagram, as a mentor for the project.Chua says one of the biggest setbacks they faced once they decided to go full-steam ahead with the project was getting the vendors to actually agree to be filmed, an uphill battle that saw them being rejected numerous times before finally finding success with a few street food vendors.“A lot of the street food vendors were rather suspicious and wondered why we wanted to shoot a documentary for free.“Many of them also didn’t want their cooking process to be filmed as they had trade secrets to keep. We told them that we wouldn’t film those parts, but even then, a lot of the vendors decided not to let us film. Some of them were scared the public would see the way the way they prepared food and would criticise them, or that they would go viral for the wrong reasons,” says Chua.To get the vendors to participate, Chua and Goh built a rapport by stopping by these eateries to purchase takeaway meals and to chat with the owners. Once a friendship was formed, they had to find ways to convince on-the-fence or reluctant vendors to trust them with their stories.“In the end, what really clicked with many of them was that we wanted to preserve their food culture and family legacy and that the documentary was about them and their legacy; not about us,” says Chua.The docu-series was filmed by a two-man crew made up of just Chua and Goh, in line with the realities of the Covid-19 pandemic, which meant they couldn’t have a huge team for the shoots. When filming, the two adopted a ‘fly-on-the-wall’ filming approach, which basically means the footage depicts what actually happens every day in the lives of these vendors i.e. there is no fancy production set-up or staged shoots.In putting together the final footage, Chua and Goh turned to Gooi for advice and feedback, having already sought his expertise pre-production.“Once we shot and edited the series, we provided drafts to send to Andrew for feedback. So every draft, he would give his feedback and we would edit it and improve it, and that’s how he was involved in the whole process,” explains Chua.The final four-episode documentary web series, titled The Melting Pot: Penang features four vendors: Cavin Mook from the legendary Moh Teng Pheow Nyonya Kuih; Ong May May from the hugely popular Air Itam Sister Curry Mee; Ooi Yeok Sun from the famous Toh Soon Café and Shahul Hameed Syed Mohamed from the iconic Hameed Pata Mee Sotong.Local food championsThe entire experience of filming and talking to acclaimed Penang street food vendors gave Chua and Goh a heightened appreciation for these tireless advocates of local food culture, who have been an integral part of the Malaysian culinary tapestry for decades.The two also discovered how heritage, modernity, innovation and progress can often be intertwined in the lives and livelihoods of these vendors, with many of their personal stories underscoring this.Shahul Hameed Syed Mohamed for instance is the second-generation owner of Hameed Pata Mee Sotong, which has been around since 1978 and is often described as a must-visit spot for locals and tourists alike.Through speaking to Hameed, Chua and Goh discovered that the mee sotong that put the restaurant (and Penang) on the map was not so much an age-old family recipe as it was invented by Hameed as a result of a challenge from a customer.“People think the mee sotong dish was passed down from Hameed’s father but actually it was a dish that came about because a customer challenged Hameed to create something new.“He used the ingredients that he had and made a gravy with sotong and put it on top of noodles. So the innovation was not from the ingredients, but from the way the ingredients were prepared. This actually created a new dish that has become synonymous with Penang and brought his business to new heights, because previously it wasn’t that famous,” says Chua.With the renowned Air Itam Sister Curry Mee, which was started in 1946 by octogenarian sisters Lim Kooi Heang and Lim Kooi Lye – Chua and Goh say they learnt how the duo’s grandniece Ong May May, who took over the running of the eatery a few years ago – had to contend with negative public perceptions about her youth and inexperience, despite retaining the traditional recipe and cooking methods used by her elderly grandaunts.“One of the things Ong suffered from a lot was that people didn’t believe she could recreate the flavours her grandaunts had created – that was one of the hardships she had to struggle with on a daily basis.“Ong could have easily had a corporate career, but she chooses to wake up at 4am every morning, to fire up the traditional charcoal fire and cook the heirloom curry mee. And the reason she chooses to do this is because of the respect she has for her grandaunts.“But at the end of the day, people were still saying the food didn’t taste as good. So we wanted to break that apart and show how she cooked the dish just like her grandaunts did,” says Chua.In many instances, Chua also realised that the older street food vendors themselves have been embracing modernity, in a bid to get younger family members interested in continuing the business. This is precisely what has happened with Toh Soon Café, which has been making Hainan-style coffee in Penang for nearly 70 years in a charming, old-school alleyway café.In 2019, the owner Ooi Yeok Sun decided to let his eldest son run a café called Toh Soon Coffee Cave Café, an offshoot that still serves the traditional cup of java, albeit in more salubrious surrounds.“Ooi has a very interesting perspective because he says hawker culture is always evolving and sometimes it is about evolving locations and flavours and creating new things.“So if the younger generation like his son can improve the flavours of the family’s coffee, he is totally fine with that, because it is not always about staying the same,” explains Chua.What’s in storeIn making the final version of The Melting Pot: Penang, Chua and Goh decided to synthesise each episode into four-minute videos, or “bite-sized” content, as Chua calls it. Although this may seem like an extremely short span of time to tell the full stories of these vendors, Chua says there is a method to this madness.“We are releasing all four stories at the same time, so people can binge on it, because what we realised is once audiences like something, they tend to binge on it.“And we decided to do short videos to gauge whether this approach to story-telling is something people can appreciate, and also because it is really hard to capture people’s attention spans with longer content.“So for us, it’s about taking baby steps first before going full force into 30-minute episodes,” says Chua.Chua and Goh both say they aim to make more documentaries about Malaysian food culture in the future to continue the work they feel is missing in the local cultural oeuvre.“If there is a lot of buzz and interest around this series and we can make it financially sustainable, we want to expand to other states and eventually make a full-length documentary on food,” says Chua.Ultimately though, these young filmmakers believe that the most important message imparted through their first food docu-series is how food ultimately connects different generations in completely different but meaningful ways.“In our current generation, we only do jobs that we like. But when we did these interviews, we realised that the older generation totally did this out of necessity. These businesses were born out of hardship; not passion.“And this made me appreciate our local hawker food more, because many of the older people making curry mee or coffee started doing it because they had to.“But the next generation of street food vendors now sees this culture as something rare and unique; like a part of their family’s heritage.“So the younger people who are doing it now are doing it as a way to preserve something important, which is really beautiful to see,” says Goh.The Melting Pot: Penang can be seen on YouTube, Facebook and Vimeo."

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",,Metro,REMAR NORDIN,‘Need for centralised system to track tourists’,"TRAVEL and tour operators in Johor eager to resume their businesses before the monsoon season kicks in, are waiting for the government to give them the green light to operate under the National Recovery Plan (NRP).Many of the operators who are based in Mersing and its surrounding areas, where they conduct many coastal leisure activities, want to make the most of the two-month period until November for sight-seeing excursions and island-hopping trips.Mersing Tourism Association (MTA) chairman Sheikh Zulkifli Sheikh Abdul Rahim said it would be the only chance for boat and island tour operators to generate some income before the monsoon arrived in about two months.He said the tourism-related industries in Mersing had to remain closed during the monsoon season until early March, as the rainy weather and choppy waters off the Mersing coast would not be conducive for leisure trips.“There are some resorts that may be in operation during the monsoon season, but the risk of visitors having their programmes cancelled is also higher because of the uncertain weather conditions.“For now, we are prepared to welcome families and other visitors who come here on a day trip to enjoy Mersing’s beautiful beaches,” he added.Sheikh Zulkifli said that with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, it was crucial for the authorities to have a centralised system to monitor and track incoming and outgoing local tourists, especially at the jetties.“We currently have two main jetties in Mersing, namely the Syahbandar Jetty under the Fisheries Department and the privately managed Tanjung Leman Jetty.“These are the two jetties from where visitors are ferried to any of the 13 islands off the Mersing coast.“So it is important that health and security measures are put in place at the two jetties so that we protect those living on the islands from contracting Covid-19.Meanwhile, tour operator Ahmad Firdaus Shaik Omar said that it would be hard for island resorts to jump-start their business with the monsoon season already around the corner, as they would not be able to generate enough profits to cover their operating costs.“Resort owners will need to have capital to hire workers.“And they may have to repair and refurbish their resorts that have not been in operation for quite some time, before they can finally open their doors.“But by the time they do so, the monsoon season will have started.“So, it will be best for them to wait until the monsoon is over and start in March next year,” he opined.He highlighted that all tourism industry players in Mersing had been fully vaccinated and were eager to restart their businesses.“We have about 600 people involved in tourism-related businesses in Mersing who have received their second (vaccine) dose,” he added.Ahmad Firdaus, who is also MTA secretary, said that besides its annual reskilling and upskilling programme, the association would continue providing food aid to those in the industry impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and during this coming monsoon season.“We hope the government will consider helping us in the tourism sector during these challenging times, so that we can be back on track once the monsoon season is over,” he said.Shaz Resort Pulau Tinggi director Datuk Md Zairi Zainal said he had recently spent RM30,000 to renovate and refurbish the resort after closing it since the start of NRP.“Work on some parts of the building had to be carried out together with repairs to the water supply and air-conditioning systems.“Unlike other resorts, we remain open until November and close in December because monsoons only hit the island in the last month of the year.”Md Zairi that should all go well, he would have enough income to pay his workers’ salaries and other expenses, adding that the resort, which used to have 16 employees, only had eight workers now."

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",,Metro,,State confident of jump-starting tourism with new initiatives,"Johor government is optimistic about reviving the state tourism industry in line with the “travel bubble” initiative announced by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.Johor tourism, youth and sports committee chairman Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi said the state government through Tourism Johor had come up with three initiatives to kick-start the industry in order to revive the state’s economy.The initiatives – Johor Tourism Interchange (JTI), Virtual Majestic Johor (VMJ) and Majestic Johor Safe (MJS) – are expected to be launched by Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad on Sept 27.“JTI is an online marketplace that collects all tourism products in Johor to give easy access to tourists, while VMJ will highlight the tourism players that have digitalised their product.“As for MJS, it is a set of special standard operating procedures (SOP) to assure domestic and international tourists on the business operators’ commitment and measures to uphold good sanitation and hygiene practices at the premises,” said Onn Hafiz.He said that he had also proposed to the Federal Government to include three districts, namely Muar, Mersing and Kota Tinggi, in the tourism travel bubble initiative as each of these towns had achieved a vaccination rate of more than 80%.“On Sept 4, Muar attained herd immunity when 84%, or 168,396 people, got the second dose of vaccine against Covid-19.“Muar is famous for its stunning scenery, historical buildings and great food.“The 13 islands off Mersing, known as the ‘Maldives of Malaysia’ have also attained a 100% vaccination rate.“The 594 people together with staff working at the various resorts on the islands have all been fully vaccinated.“Desaru Coast in Kota Tinggi, recognised as one of the World’s Greatest Places in 2021, achieved a vaccination rate of 91%, with 1,210 workers having received the second dose,” he added.Onn Hafiz said the state government would continue to implement various tourism rehabilitation efforts to strengthen Johor as a brand, with a focus on promoting major tourist destinations in all the state’s 10 districts.“Each district has various special features that can be promoted as a unique selling point.“This in turn will also show that we are capable of rising up and become an exceptional tourism destination that is also safe to visit.“However, this will only be achieved through the ongoing vaccination programme and adherence to standard operating procedures (SOP), which will be the key in accelerating the country’s economic growth,” he reiterated.Meanwhile, Mersing District Council (MDM) president Norazmi Amir Hamzah said the council would be working together with other government agencies in sorting out the SOP and sanitation work at public amenities especially at the public jetties.He said the council would also engage with island tour companies to ensure that the number of visitors to the islands was manageable in order to limit the possibility of an outbreak.“Right now, our primary worry is the number of people coming to the island via the jetties, and if possible, we prefer to limit the number of people coming in to minimise overcrowding and make it simpler to monitor and manage.“We will be working with tour operators to get the number of people coming in and the schedule.“This is to help ease the traffic flow at the jetties and maybe open up more entry and departure points for island-hopping trips, snorkelling and travelling to the islands,” he added.Norazmi further said the council would issue guidelines to other authorities, such as the police, Fisheries Department and Health Ministry, to guarantee a smooth flow of operations.“Tourism players should also play their role in helping the authorities to monitor their guests and ensure they strictly follow the rules.“This includes making sure that the environment is clean and to avoid littering on the islands,” he said, adding that he believed that people were already well-versed in the guidelines under the new norm and would have no trouble following the order.Norazmi also said the council was working with Mersing Tourism Association (MTA) in sharing the SOP and Sustainable Travel Mersing initiative to the tour operators and agencies."

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",,Metro,SHEILA SRI PRIYA,‘Laminated card number system unhygienic’,"A NEW practice introduced at the SS2 morning market in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, has customers hot and bothered.Visitors are required to pay RM1 for a laminated card, which bears a number, to enter the market.When leaving the market, they must return the card to get back their deposit.Housewife Teresa Lim said the market management should come up with a better system to keep track of people entering and leaving the market.“The card is usually wet and I do not feel comfortable holding it.“I worry it is not sanitised after each use,” she said.There are two entrance and exit points at the market and someone is on duty at both ends to collect the money and give out the cards.Another visitor, Joshua Chen, echoed Lim’s sentiments and said there should be a system that did not require an item changing hands repeatedly.SS2 Petaling Jaya Hawkers and Petty Traders Association chairman Leng Chin Huat said it was advised by Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) to implement a system to keep track of the number of visitors.“Only 150 customers are allowed into the market at any one time.“When we gave out the cards for free, the public did not return them to us.“So we came up with the deposit system to ensure they return the cards.“Each card costs about 80sen.“The first time, I made 400 cards and 200 went missing,” said Leng.He added that the Sungai Way and Section 17 markets also practised a similar system.An MBPJ spokesperson said traders should use other methods to keep tabs on the number of people entering the market."

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",11:11 PM MYT,News,,Hisham: Immigration asked to review categories of applications without applying via ‘MyTravelPass’,"KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): The Immigration Department has been asked to review the categories of applications heading overseas that can be granted permission directly, without having to apply through “MyTravelPass”.Defence Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussien said the directive was issued by the National Security Council (NSC) following the Pandemic Management Special Committee Meeting on Wednesday (Sept 15), after taking into account public feedback and views on the MyTravelPass programme.The Immigration Department will present the proposal to the NSC’s Covid-19 Technical Committee, he said in a statement here.There are five categories of people who do not need to apply for approval through MyTravelPass to go overseas, namely diplomats and Malaysian Embassy officials returning to work abroad, including their dependents; students and dependents who are continuing their studies provided they have a valid student visa or dependent visa; and long-term pass holders of other countries (Permanent Resident/ Resident Pass/ Employment Pass).The other two categories comprise those working with petroleum and shipping companies who need to sign-on on ships overseas; and those escorting students abroad for study purposes, which is limited to two escorts.The categories that need to get MyTravelPass approval are citizens who have just been offered a job or entry into an educational institution abroad; students wishing to sit for examinations abroad; attending meetings/seminars/business affairs abroad; and those participating in exhibitions/sports competitions/training abroad, together with a letter of support from the relevant regulatory Agency.The other three categories are emergency affairs concerning immediate family members (death/accident/illness); partner/fiancé visa holder (marriage not legally registered); and those participating in humanitarian/religious aid missions.On the issue of certain airlines stipulating that passengers show their MyTravelPass even if they were in categories of those not required to apply for one, Hishammuddin said that should not have happened.""I have asked Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong to inform the companies to follow the guidelines that have been set,"" he said on Thursday (Sept 16).He said from Oct 7, 2020, to Sept 10, 2021, the Immigration Department had received 356,510 applications, and of the total, 208,509 applications were approved; 127,465 rejected; 6,697 cancelled by the applicants themselves; and 13,000 still being processed.According to him, there are four factors that can cause an application to be rejected, namely the name is on the list of suspects of the Malaysian Immigration Department; incomplete documentation; uploaded documents cannot be read; and if documents are falsified.Hishammuddin said applications for MyTravel Pass must be done online at https://mtp.imi.gov.my, 14 days prior to expected departure. – Bernama"

The outcome decides the headlines... rarely is the game fantastic or bad, it is somewhere in between.""""We know the expectations are high and we expect more of ourselves as well, the performance wasn't up to our standard.""The Norwegian, however, said that the players reacted well to the loss in Switzerland and he expected United, like ""all good teams"", to bounce back.The former striker swatted away questions about his style of play, saying he did not swear by an ""overarching philosophy"".""I don't sit here and claim and talk... football is a simple game and it's about making good decisions and being in a team. ""Sometimes we look too much into the all intricacies and it's passion, it's desire... you can talk about all sorts, it looks nice on paper.""Striker Edinson Cavani will not feature against West Ham, the United boss confirmed, adding that he was hopeful midfielder Jesse Lingard, who has one year left on his contract, will stay at Old Trafford.Table-toppers United are unbeaten in their opening four games.

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",12:36 PM MYT,Opinion,KUIK CHENG KANG,Malaysia Day: The sun rises from the East,"RISING in the morning, we will be ushering in the 58th Malaysia Day.In the past, people living in Peninsular Malaysia only used to celebrate Merdeka Day on Aug 31, and they hardly had any feeling for their compatriots across the South China Sea.But to people living in East Malaysia, Aug 31 is at best only the independence day for Malaya or the peninsula, as well as Sabah's self-government day.Malaysia Day on Sept 16 should be the big day to be celebrated by everyone in this country!The seat of administration centred in the peninsula has for so many decades ignored the feelings of East Malaysians, and Malaysia Day only started to get the Federal government's attention after West Malaysian politics plunged into a mess and East Malaysians' votes and support were sought.In other words, thanks to a shift in the country's political environment, East Malaysia has seen itself rising as a more recognised stakeholder of this nation.Talking about this unique opportunity that has altered the political ecosystem of West Malaysia, we cannot go without mentioning the late Sarawak chief minister Adenan Satem.Some of Adenan's most powerful quotes remain deeply etched in the minds of many Malaysians to this day. Among them:""I feel sick of the Federal government's education policy. Sarawak cannot keep following West Malaysia's education policy. Being in a union doesn't mean unity, and diversity can unite the people too.""""Sarawak's position is very consistent. We will never allow Hudud to be implemented here.""""I don't just want a Malay government, nor a Dayak government. All I want is a government that represents all ethnicities.""""I told the prime minister it is up to you if UEC is not recognised in West Malaysia, but we want it over here in Sarawak.""""Independent high schools are not just for Chinese students. There are plenty of non-Chinese students opting to study there. Many rural Malays and bumiputras are eager to send their children to these schools.""""The Chinese are not pendatang in Sarawak, although some foolish guys in West Malaysia call them so. These people should go to hell!""""This is the time for the Chinese to make a decision whether they want to be a part of the Sarawak government and participate in the state's operation, or just vent their anger outside the government. They have to make a choice. I will not be happy if there is no Chinese representation in my government.""""Although I am doing my utmost to fight for Sarawak's lost sovereign rights, that does not mean we are fighting for Sarawak's independence. Secession from Malaysia is utterly stupid.""""Christians can freely use the word 'Allah'. I have no objection to it, and I won't allow religious fanatics to come into Sarawak and sabotage our religious and racial harmony and solidarity.""Adenan did not need a lot of impressive political slogans. He walked the talk in preserving East Malaysia's culturally diverse environment.When asked who they are, people in East Malaysia will tell you: ""I'm from Sandakan"", or ""I'm from Sibu"", or ""I'm from Kuching"". Anyone who has visited the two East Malaysian states and has patronised a local coffee shop can tell that Muslims are often seen sharing the same table with the Chinese, and won't mind if you are eating pork in front of them.People in East Malaysia spontaneously embrace one another's languages, cultures and cuisines, and this is very much reflected in their day-to-day living.By right, the depth of interracial integration should be the most natural portrayal of people in this country, a quality that is sadly most lacking in our politicians right now.When asked who you are, people in West Malaysia will invariably reply: ""I'm Chinese"", ""I'm Malay"", or ""I'm Indian"". No one will straight away tell you something like ""I'm from Muar"".Ironically, we will tell people that we are Malaysians only when we are out of the country.From colonial times to the 60-year rule by Umno, the various peoples of this country had been subjected to the ""divide and rule"" policy. People from different ethnic backgrounds sharing a meal at a coffee shop has since become a distant memory of our grandfathers.For the past so many years, in order to win the so-called traditional Malay support, Umno leaders have never ceased playing up racial politics and religious sentiments, often at the expense of inter-racial harmony, unity and national identity that we are supposed to cherish for more than six decades.To reverse the negative perceptions among people they had hurt so much in the past, some of these leaders who later managed to ascend to high offices started to introduce slogans tied to being ""Malaysians"".For example, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim suffered very bad reputation among the local Chinese community over the dispatch of non-Chinese senior staff to SJKCs and the mass arrests and closure of Sin Chew Daily and two other newspapers during Operasi Lalang while he was the education minister back in 1987. As such, after he was appointed deputy prime minister by Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad later on, he coined the ""We are Family"" slogan.At the height of tension during Operasi Lalang, then-Umno Youth chairman Datuk Seri Najib Razak led a massive protest at Jalan Raja Muda stadium in KL in a show of force on Oct 17, 1987. Banners with racist slurs were said to have been used at the rally. When answering a question from the late DAP leader Karpal Singh at a parliamentary sitting later, he squarely denied having issued any racist remark.And when he became the country's sixth prime minister, he even championed the famous ""Satu Malaysia"" slogan!In the racially-charged aftermath of a mobile phone theft at Low Yat Plaza in Kuala Lumpur in 2015, then-rural and regional development minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob infuriated many local Chinese with his irresponsible remarks. And soon after he became the country's ninth prime minister, he came up with the heartwarming ""Keluarga Malaysia"" slogan.Among the many past prime ministers, only Dr Mahathir and Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi created slogans associated with the country's development. Sure enough, Dr Mahathir had plenty of slogans throughout his many years of premiership, the most talked about being ""Bersih, Cekap, Amanah"" when he was still new in office in 1982, followed by the ""Look East"" policy, ""Wawasan 2020"" and more recently ""Shared Prosperity Vision 2030"".As for Tun Abdullah, he is best remembered for his ""Cemerlang, Gemilang dan Terbilang"" slogan.I'm sure all our Umno leaders appreciate the beauty of this country's ethnic, cultural and religious diversity which forms the cornerstone for the nation's forward thrust. In view of this, these leaders have resorted to conceiving all sorts of spirit-lifting slogans to whitewash their poor public images.Although it is never too late to make amends, such missteps should have been avoided if these people had anticipated the impact much earlier on.Won't it be just great to be a rightful Malaysian from day one in politics? Unfortunately, while many West Malaysian politicians love to chant patriotic slogans every now and then, they keep doing things that hurt the feelings of other ethnic groups.Due to the swelling of the middle class and Malay elite, many young urban Malays have become increasingly aware of the importance of human rights, systemic corruption in public services as well as the issues of equality and freedom. Unfortunately many in Umno have failed to notice the changes taking place in the society, and that explains why the Umno-led government was plucked out by the voters in 2018.If the Umno successors now returning to the pinnacle of power in Putrajaya fail to see this and are happy to revert to their old ways of doing things, their days are numbered, for sure!As a Malaysian in West Malaysia, I'm eager to see the Sun rise from East Malaysia and sow the seed of hope that transcends our religious, cultural and linguistic differences.I'm also anticipating the birth of a leader for all of Malaysia who doesn't thrive on empty slogans but inwardly respects all our many differences.On this Malaysia Day, it's our dream that someone from East Malaysia will become our prime minister one day.Kuik Cheng Kang is editor-in-chief of Sin Chew Daily"
"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",1:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,DR SANGEETA KAUR,The digital healthcare generation gap in Malaysia,"Each generation of Malaysians share certain homogeneous experiences by the sheer virtue of living through the same period of time.Experiences in this context refer to significant external events during the individual’s late adolescence and early adulthood years.Similarly, the notion of homogeneity and its impact is reflective of the individual’s historical and societal experiences that act as influences, which form values, beliefs and lifestyles that distinguish one generation from the other.The first five generations of Malaysians can be classified into:Veterans – the hardworking and pragmatic generation that survived the Japanese occupation during World War 2.Reformers – those born in the 1940s-60s, who believed in a better life, having lived though the communist insurgence, the formation of Malaysia and the May 13, 1969, racial riots.Strivers – those born in the 1960s, who focus on stability and comfort, having experienced the nation’s rapid economic and social development.Pursuers – those born in the 1970s, who endeavour to achieve their ambitions and goals through the uncertainty of rapidly-advancing technology and economic crises.Inheritors – Those born in the 1990s and after into the digital age, who adopt and adapt what is available to them.So, how did these different generations adapt to the seismic change from the Covid-19 pandemic, and how does this impact their approach towards healthcare?The way forwardIn South-East Asia, the Malaysian healthcare system is lauded as a model for other developing countries.We are indeed proud of our achievements, but our main challenge lies in the fact that healthcare costs have been rising over the last three decades.The healthcare inflation in Malaysia stood at 12% in 2017 – the third highest out of 11 Asian countries.By the end of 2018, this rose to 13%.The way forward is to redesign the current system, and switch it from heavy curative care to a preventive model with an integrated approach that depends on multisectoral and community-driven engagement.Such engagement aims to improve primary care with a health system that focuses on the patient.While the goal is to reduce cost, the healthcare system must still ensure quality, efficiency and effectiveness of its services.Technology is key to this as it can reduce resources, while improving monitoring and providing quick turnaround information that ensures sustainability over time.At the same time, improvements of this kind must be able to mobilise communities to engage in preventive care actively.This emphasises the need to ensure all generations of Malaysians have sufficient literacy and skills to benefit from technological updates within our healthcare system.In addition, the experience of each generation in the digital age is an essential factor.As each generation shares formative experiences as they age, this will affect future experiences and behaviour in how individuals perceive and experience digital technology in a healthcare context.For example, Strivers tend to be less passive and more critical of the healthcare system, in contrast to Veterans.Meanwhile, Inheritors have unprecedented ease with health-related technology and have the know-how to solve problems, making them quick to decide based on the information available to them.However, local evidence has highlighted that health literacy is a factor in the use of health-related technology.For instance, Inheritors from Selangor reported unfamiliarity with mobile health services that aim to improve population health.The ignorance of available technology is not only a problem among specific generations in Malaysia, but also a lingering cloud over our medically-based system that is struggling with the necessary adaptation to the health information ecosystem.Trust is an issueDespite all these challenges, we now know that the seismic change brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic has formed a different perspective of Malaysians’ behaviour towards healthcare.It brought to light the burden on health and human resources, while promoting the rapid development and adaptation of digital solutions for both service providers and receivers.Such transformations were doable because 54% of Asia’s population was already online before the pandemic, with this number growing each year.In 2016, Malaysia ranked 41st in the global digital adaptation index.In 2019, we ranked among the top five for social media penetration in South-East Asia, with 81% of Malaysians being active social media users.That year also saw over 90% of Malaysian households having an internet connection and 135% usage of mobile applications, with 93% of the population using smartphones to access the internet.Additionally, there is evidence indicating that most Pursuers and Inheritors are using at least one health or wellness app.Finally, 70% of mobile subscribers are using 4G.Such high use meant that there were no issues when both Federal and state governments introduced a proliferation of apps to track the impact of Covid-19 on Malaysians last year.Let’s take a look at the most ubiquitous among these apps: MySejahtera.This app was initially launched to track and treat Covid-19 cases, trace those at risk, and monitor symptoms.In August 2020, it was made mandatory for all business operations to enforce the use of MySejahtera.The app was guaranteed to be safe as all the data collected through it is wholly owned by the Health Ministry, and supervised by the National Cyber Security Agency (Nacsa) and the National Security Council (NSC).MySejahtera quickly evolved to also become a source of Covid-19 health information and data, as well as the point of coordination for vaccination.Some 42% of Malaysians have installed this app, with 41% actually activating it.However, only 17% have used it to report if they tested positive.One of the reasons for this low uptake when it comes to reporting a positive Covid-19 status, could be due to concerns over the misuse of information collected.Concerns over institutional trustworthiness have always lingered across all Malaysian generations.In fact, such worries were highlighted in the Malaysian Digital Economy Blueprint, which included strategies to improve the faith in the digital aspect of the national healthcare system.This is indeed a valid concern as trust issues have only escalated during the pandemic.For instance, the sharing of specific contact-tracing information has led to stigma and discrimination towards those linked to significant clusters, particularly those considered superspreader events.However, the good news is that Inheritors, Pursuers, Strivers and Reformers, i.e. three-quarters of Malaysians surveyed last year (2020), claimed they trust the healthcare system, especially in preventive measures such as escalating vaccine uptake.Such trust in healthcare rose from 63% in 2018.Promoting literacy and engagementThere is no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has encouraged the uptake of healthcare technology both among healthcare professionals and the public.However, the fact remains that, thus far, the generations that take the most advantage of digital healthcare are the Inheritors and some of the Pursuers.But health literacy is also an issue among these generations.Given the fast-paced evolution of technology, there is a pressing need to further understand how health literacy relates to the usage of health information technology, especially apps.We also need to ensure growth in health literacy and active engagement in healthcare.If we address these areas, it will ensure that all users receive the full benefits from these technological advances, while we continue to protect health information privacy.Dr Sangeeta Kaur is a senior lecturer in epidemiology and public health at

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",3:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,LEONARD SELVA GURUNATHAN,Heart and Soul: Life lessons from making mooncakes,"It was a Saturday, my weekend offline, away from online lessons with my students.It was time for a rare luxurious moment of self-indulgence. I grabbed a physical newspaper and a hot cup of coffee, and some toasted bread with salted butter.While having breakfast, I started reading the news of the day. Then I noticed an extra item next to my butter-drenched toast: my home-baked mooncakes.I enjoy eating mooncakes. But I had never thought of making them myself until last year.During MCO 1.0, I dabbled in baking many Western-style baked goods like croissants and puff pastry, but I never thought of attempting a local dessert. Then one day I saw my favourite baker, youtuber Joshua Weissman, baking mooncakes. So I took the courage to try.So here I am in 2021, a year after baking my first mooncakes, and am at it again. The one-year-old mooncake press mould I bought last year is put to use again.I learnt that there are mini life lessons in the process of making many Asian baked desserts. My mooncake baking journey started with soaking the red beans overnight, so it’s not a one-day affair. Life is all about patience and not rushing into things.The next day, I did the dough. After mixing the golden syrup (store-bought) with oil and lye water, I mixed the flour and kneaded it into a dough. The dough was then left to rest for a few hours; I found that leaving it for four hours yielded a texture to my liking. The hard work took time to produce results. In a world that demands instant results, this waiting for the dough to rest is a useful reminder to me.Then I boiled the red beans for about an hour till they became mushy. I also needed to make sure they did not get burnt. The mushy red beans were then blended into a paste. Lesson: Sometimes, the environment can be a challenge for us but putting ourselves through it can make us better and stronger. In the case of the red beans, on the day I soaked them, they were rock hard and couldn't be used for the mooncakes. You would even break your teeth if you were to bite them. But after going through soaking and boiling, it was very soft.I cooked the paste with sugar and oil until it became a thick paste that could hold its shape. Then I let it cool.Next came my favourite part: placing the filling and wrapping the filling with a thin layer of the dough. This required the right ratio of the filling to the dough skin. I tried to make the skin as thin as possible (adjusting the ratio to match the filling) so that the mould pattern would form clearly on it.The mooncakes were baked for five minutes and then taken out for egg wash. That was the most delicate moment and I carefully brushed the mooncakes with egg yolk wash. I had to take care not to overbrush the mooncakes, otherwise the egg yolk wash would flood the fine details of the patterns, causing the patterns to be lost and submerged under a layer of egg yolk wash. In a world where we think the more we have, the better we are, sometimes when we load ourselves with our vanity – ranging from what we watch to what we eat – we lose our true selves when they are covered by our superficial selves.The mooncakes went back into the oven for another five minutes, then out again for a second brush. Another round of delicate brush work was required to make the mooncakes glossy.Finally, the mooncakes went back in for one final bake of about 30 minutes.On my first attempt, I was impatient and ate them soon after baking. But now, I only start eating them three days after baking. I can taste the difference. Also, those that are kept for three days have a nicer dark golden colour compared to freshly baked ones. The mantra of being patient and allowing time to get a better result is silently whispered to me by the mooncakes.I did further reading on this delicacy and found that it has a rich history.I also gave my home-baked mooncakes to my family and buddies nearby for their feedback.They enjoyed them, which made me happy.It will take many years to master baking the mooncake but I look forward to baking it every year. No doubt the mooncakes are calorie-rich, but they can never match the richness of love, gratitude and friendship in the heart when the mooncakes are shared with family and friends.For next year’s mooncakes, I will be making my first golden syrup this year, which will be kept for a year for it to mature."

For sure different ethnic groups have their own phrases to describe themselves also but I thought ‘orang kita’ is an interesting phrase to repurpose and make it more inclusive since ‘kita’ means ‘us’. Identity is always fluid but it is also a powerful currency wielded by those in power for their own benefits to sway the masses,” said Azmyl, who is also an academic, about his new video single.“The song is a symbolic resistance to this – if you strip away all the layers of race, gender, and religion – institutions that construct differences – we’re all just human – hence the ‘Aku Manusia!’ refrain. We are all the same species. Never forget that,” he added.The video was directed by filmmaker Alina Wong, and the single lifted from Azmyl's John Bangi Blues album.More info here.VIRTUAL CONCERT: #BEBASDIMYPENTASTime: OngoingCelebrate Malaysia Day with MyPentas’s free virtual concert #BebasDiMyPentas.It brings together 16 Malaysian artistes across diverse genres.

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",3:05 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,White House offers to talk to rapper Nicki Minaj about vaccines,"The White House offered Wednesday (Sept 15) to connect Nicki Minaj with one of the Biden administration’s doctors to address her questions about the Covid-19 vaccine, after the Trinidadian-born rapper’s erroneous tweet alleging the vaccine causes impotence went viral.The White House said that they’ve offered such calls with others concerned about the vaccine, part of an aggressive public relations campaign to beat back rampant disinformation about the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness.Minaj tweeted Wednesday that ""the White House has invited me” and ""yes, I’m going,” but a White House official said the rapper was simply offered a call.Minaj made headlines earlier this week when she noted in a tweet to her more than 22.6 million followers that the Met Gala required attendees to be vaccinated, and that she wouldn’t get the shot until ""I feel I’ve done enough research”. She later issued a tweet sharing an unverified story about a cousin’s friend in Trinidad. Minaj asserted the unidentified individual ""became impotent” and ""his testicles became swollen” after receiving the shot.Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, dismissed the claim as misinformation during an interview Tuesday on CNN.""There’s no evidence that it happens, nor is there any mechanistic reason to imagine that it would happen,” he said.Throughout the year, the White House has struggled to counteract resistance to getting a shot, particularly among younger and more Republican demographics. The administration has pointed in particular to false or misleading information about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines as a driver of that hesitance. It has referenced a study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that studies extremism, that linked a dozen accounts to spreading the majority of vaccine disinformation on Facebook.The administration has sought out new ways to refute disinformation and reach young vaccine skeptics, earlier this year inviting teen pop star Olivia Rodrigo to the White House to show her support for the shot. – AP"
"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",3:15 PM MYT,Business,,Asian shares fall on Chinese developers' woes,"HONG KONG: Falls in Chinese property stocks pushed Asian shares down for a fourth day on Thursday, reversing initial gains, while the dollar was in the doldrums floating within its recent range.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last down 0.8%, and 2.8% lower on the week, while Japan's Nikkei shed 0.71%, but after hitting a 31-year high on Monday.Futures suggested a mixed open for European equities, with the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures up 0.17% but FTSE futures were 0.04% lower. U.S. stock futures S&P 500 e-minis were 0.09% lower.In Asia, the Hong Kong benchmark led the declines, sliding 2.08% to its lowest since the end of October, as Chinese property developers' shares were hurt by the sense that the endgame for embattled developer China Evergrande Group's was edging closer.The company, which has total liabilities of more than $300 billion and is scrambling to raise funds to pay its many lenders and suppliers, on Thursday applied to suspend trading of its main unit's onshore corporate bonds following a downgrade.The Hang Seng Composite Index tracking properties and construction stocks fell 4.3%, with big falls at developers such as Guangzhou R&F, diving 12.2% to the lowest since December 2008, and Sunac China tumbling 11.5%.The Evergrande situation shows ""the general property market is very weak despite stable property prices,"" said Edison Pun, a senior market analyst at Saxo Markets.""Earnings for these property companies will be deeply affected as the sentiment worsens.""Evergrande's own shares dropped 8.2% on Thursday and have plunged more than 80% this year.Elsewhere Chinese blue chips dropped 1.22%, a day after economic data missed expectations, but Australian shares gained 0.5%, helped by rising energy stocks as oil prices rose.Employment in Australia though fell sharply in August, data showed, causing the Australian dollar to edge 0.2% lower to $0.7320, while other currencies were largely subdued in Asian hours.The dollar gained marginally against a basket of major currencies, but benchmark U.S. Treasuries were steady with 10-year Treasury notes yielding 1.3005%, barely changed from their U.S. close.Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.68%, the S&P 500 gained 0.85% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.82%, as rising crude oil prices boosted energy shares and a raft of positive U.S. data supported a view that growth in the world's biggest economy should remain strong.Oil prices continued to gain in Asian trading after a larger-than-expected drawdown in crude oil stocks in the United States.Brent crude oil rose 18 cents, or 0.2%, to $75.64 a barrel.Spot gold slipped 0.45% to $1784.21 per ounce. - Reuters"

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",5:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,NASA MARIA ENTABAN,'Accidental interior designer' Joe Chan on his style and how he started out,"As a child, Joe Chan – interior designer, founder and principal of the award-winning firm DesignTone Interior Practice – was handy with carpentry tools, spending hours helping his father make simple homemade furniture.This hobby would become the foundation on which he built his interest in architecture, giving him the skills to be able to visualise how things come together.Chan was also good at art, sketching and doodling, and it was only natural that he would take up an endeavour related to design.“A career in interior design, it was by chance,” says Chan. “I actually graduated in architecture, and I couldn’t get a job in any architecture firm. It was the period where the country was in the midst of recovering from the recession back in the 1990s.”Eventually, Chan landed his first job in an interior design company and never looked back: he is a registered interior designer with The Board of Architects Malaysia as well as Malaysian Institute of Interior Designers.“I always tell people, I am an accidental interior designer, and I would like to take this opportunity to highlight that it is important for the public to know that the interior design profession is a legislated profession in our country, just like an architect and or engineer.”What would you say is your signature design style?I do not believe in having a signature style in my design approach. I strongly believe that a designer should be versatile and be like a “chameleon”, adapting to the needs and wants of the client. So you can see my design style is very diverse from my company’s design portfolio.My practice is always associated with bold, colourful and vibrant design, that is what others associate with us.On a personal note, I would consider myself a minimalist. I do like spaces that are clean, minimal and non-cluttered to evoke the sense of space. Hence, I constantly work within this ethos: subtle sophistication. Rather than a signature style, one important thing to me is asking the right design questions. The rigour to this question will result in a design that is a resultant of creative problem-solving approach, rather than one that is predictable and cookie-cutter.What is it about your style that appeals to clients?Most of the time when clients come to me, it may not necessarily be due to our design style as they probably have seen our work online.Many times, it has been for our versatility in the design execution and how we are able to add value, as well as provide solutions to their design needs and wants. We are able to create a holistic experience, yet pragmatic solutions.Where do you get design inspiration from, and how do you balance your design vision with the client’s requests?I am constantly curious about anything to do with design, be it interior design, architecture, art and fashion hence I read a lot and observe what is revolving and evolving around me. This enables me to stay in the know on what is relevant to our interior design profession. What others do is always my inspiration, even if it does not conform to my personal design preference.This multitude of exposure allows me to constantly question the stereotype of design, hence providing me an opportunity to create design that is bespoke. Of course, travelling helps a lot too. In short, inspiration comes from the assimilation of the many experiences I had.My design vision is constantly evolving and to balance my vision with the client’s request, I start off with putting a lot of effort and understanding into the client’s vision first. I continuously question myself, what I can do to further enhance the client’s request and I have a lot of discussions with the client. I do not force my vision but instead I rationalise with them to create a synergy and that’s where we can work on a common ground. Then we will be able to balance each other’s vision.What is your favourite way to maximise spaces like nooks, under the stairs and hallways?While this area is always a challenge to design, to me the simplest solution is always the best. I would always play with a lighter colour palette to allow the space to look wider, taller and include furniture that is at the right size and proportion, not overly bulky. This is to give the area a sense of lightness. Material usage is also a key factor as a good balance of matte, gloss and reflective material does the trick.Do you have a favourite type of space to style, and why?Nowadays I love to style bathrooms and see how it integrates into the whole design scheme of a home. To me it’s a very important space that most of us tend to take for granted and often neglect in the design scheme.The bathroom is a place to get refreshed once you get out of bed in the morning and when you return home after having a long day.How has your business fared during the pandemic, what have you learned from it? What do you feel you have accomplished during this period?Undeniably, the pandemic has affected most industries and ours has not been spared either. In general it has slowed down, but I am rather surprised that we are rather busy, not only with a lot of proposals for residential units but also developer show galleries and units. However, I would say the budget is rather tight since the pandemic.Having said that, weathering and surviving this “storm” and being left unscathed on its own is already an accomplishment. I do hope we can be back to normalcy soon, it would be great to see the industry blooming again.What was your inspiration for the design of your own home?For my home I didn’t follow any style in particular, I focused on my own needs and made sure I had an efficient and no-fuss space that suits my own, as well as my family’s lifestyle as well as habits. Learning from the mistakes and shortcomings of my previous homes definitely influenced the design of my current home.For the outlook I like the usage of raw and natural finished materials. My living room is finished with natural cement flooring while all the other rooms have a wood flooring finish. As for wall paneling and built-in furniture, I used a lot of natural hardwood and plywood with a natural lacquered finish as well as ash wood, which are all on a light timber tone.This helped create a warm palette to the interior with a good play on natural and artificial lighting. I decided to have minimal furniture in my home, to avoid cluttering and which allows me to enjoy the spatial quality. To quote the famous architect Mies Van Der Rohe, “less is more”.What are some personal elements from your childhood/family/past that you have incorporated into the design of your home?I’ve always had a penchant for classic and antique items. I am lucky to have quite a bit of electrical appliances, furniture and knick knacks that were passed down from my family and relatives. These items are displayed and used all over my home as decorative items and repurposed for different usages.One example is a classic sewing machine that was left with only its back, with a metal support and leg pedal. So I added a top surface and a drawer to it, and now it serves as a console table and drawer for keys and other accessories.I particularly like the mother of pearl chair that sits in my living room beside a 100-year-old working bench taken from my granduncle’s old shop. All these just complete the overall vibe that I want in my home."

In the meantime, repeats will be scheduled.”Last week, the Instagram account announced that the National Radio Hall of Famer cancelled all of the promotional appearances for the show due to “ongoing health issues”.In March 2020, the 57-year-old divorcee emphatically told Dr Oz she would not be getting inoculated.“No. I don’t trust it,” Williams said. “I’ve never gotten the flu shot either, though, and you and I have talked about that. Several of the doctors on my team have told me, ‘Wendy, get the flu shot.’ I’ve never had the flu. I’m not getting a flu shot. I very rarely get a cold. I never have headaches. I don’t take aspirin because I feel my heart murmur or something like that. I’m not getting it — no! I don’t trust it. There, I said it.”In May, however, Williams announced that her live studio audience would be able to return on June 1 to its Chelsea set – only if they were fully vaccinated.On the Emmy Award-nominated chatfest, the brutally honest Lifetime biopic and in her best-selling autobiography, Williams has openly discussed some of her health challenges, which has included substance abuse, Graves disease and lymphedema. – New York Daily News/Tribune News Service"

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",7:19 AM MYT,StarPicks,MAHADHIR AZIZ,Striving for a digitally-united and sovereign Malaysia,"THIS September 16 marks the second Malaysia Day since the global pandemic swept across the world. As we continue our fight against the pandemic, now, more than ever, is a time for us to celebrate unity and our collective strength as Malaysians.The pandemic forced society to face technological change, not something that we were prepared for – a McKinsey & Company study found on average, seven years’ worth of digitalisation was condensed in a matter of months. This unprecedented rate of digitalisation is causing displacements across society and industries.This also resulted in a radically shifting job landscape. The Future of Jobs Report 2020 by the World Economic Forum indicated that Covid-19 has greatly accelerated the digitalisation of work processes, necessitating upskilling and reskilling employees to adapt to market demands.We must be united to take on the challenges and to address it as a united family. The family requires everyone to contribute to its wellbeing. It requires us to be united on the digital front, with the independence to define digital destiny and sovereignty. This is the time for Malaysians to be ‘Digitally United’.For us to flourish in the digital age, we need a digital ecosystem that is healthy and balanced. An ecosystem is not just made from a select few entities. Similarly, in the tech space, it is not just innovators and creators, but also the presence of enablers and supporters that complete the equation. It is also about the users – the people that are impacted by technology.Each entity in an ecosystem relies on each other to thrive and survive. As such, we need an ecosystem that is not only technologically advanced, but also inclusive. Digital advancements cannot just be progress for progress’ sake. There needs to be solutions to bridge gaps and democratise access.An inclusive ecosystem is one that communicates and collaborates. We can no longer be an ecosystem consisting of silos. Further digital disruptions can only be tackled together, by the Government, agencies, corporates and the rakyat, as one united family, as Keluarga Malaysia.It is important for us to rally behind a common goal. The Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint (MyDigital) and the Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 introduced by the Government provide clear directions we can aspire towards, while the Jendela plan to widen and improve quality connectivity forms the infrastructural backbone that we can build and innovate upon.Over the past years, the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) has run several campaigns and initiatives aimed at helping Malaysians navigate disruptions and overcome the challenges by taking the digital approach. They are also testaments to how public-private collaborations can lead to an encompassing and inclusive outcome.Succeeding in a new and fast-digitalising world requires new strategies. We launched the #SayaDigital campaign to provide digital skills and increase incomes for both the rakyat and businesses.This includes Mydigitalworkforce Work in Tech (MYWiT), an initiative to upskill and subsidise talents and businesses with RM100mil for digital skills training and salary incentives. Through this, more than 300 companies within the tech sector are expected to benefit from the programme, while an estimated 6,000 job opportunities will be created.We also introduced the Go-eCommerce Onboarding and Shop Malaysia Online (SMO) campaigns, to help Malaysian businesses in various sectors to get onboard e-commerce and e-payment platforms to enhance their capabilities, as part of the 2021 Budget.The initiative sees the Government injecting RM200mil in subsidies, incentives, discounts and rebates to benefit 300,000 local businesses and help generate over 10 million transactions in aid of economic recovery.With our Heart of Digital Asean campaign, we aim to raise local startup champions and to provide the best possible investment hub for investors to land and expand into Malaysia and Asean. With this, we are poised to uphold digital sovereignty for the nation and to establish Malaysia as truly the Heart of Digital Asean.These initiatives help feed into a healthy, sustainable digital ecosystem. But it is not something that MDEC could achieve on its own – nor do we want to – it is a collaborative effort, upheld by all stakeholders, united, towards the common goal of shared prosperity and economic recovery.Tunku Abdul Rahman once said: “We are all Malaysians. This is the bond that unites us. Let us always remember that unity is our fundamental strength as a people and as a nation.”MDEC will drive more of such unity going forward – united in both purpose and action. In the spirit of Malaysia Day, let us strive to be ‘Digitally United’, for a future that enables equality and prosperity for all.Mahadhir Aziz is the chief executive officer of the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation."

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",7:52 AM MYT,StarPicks,,Here’s the Covid-19 reset that might save the Malaysian economy,"Intelligent digital health platform enables affordable frequent or daily testing to restore normalcy to live, work and play.AFTER more than a year spent in isolation and quarantine due to Covid-19, many have come away wondering if the world will be returning to its pre-pandemic normalcy.The answer, however, is not so straightforward; while there are many reasons to stay cautious in the wake of rising mutated variants, staying cloistered for so long has quickly demonstrated economic repercussions.In an article by market and consumer data specialist Statista, the global gross domestic product (GDP) last year declined by 6.7% owing to the pandemic’s outbreak. Latin America suffered a heavy GDP loss of 8.5%.Closer to home, only 4.7% of Malaysian businesses reported being able to survive for more than six months in the ‘Effects of Covid-19 on Companies and Business Firms’ survey conducted by the Department of Statistics in 2020A bitter yet unavoidable pill to swallow, the movement control (MCO) 1.0 reportedly charted daily losses at a whopping RM2.4bil, which fell to RM300mil in MCO 2.0 as the pandemic eased and more economic sectors resumed operations.However this was short-lived as a sudden spike in infections in May this year meant the swift reinstatement of MCO 3.0, just as the Delta variant surfaced in the country.Social discordBut the pandemic has not only played havoc with the economy, it has also affected all layers of society both socially and mentally.Police reported that suicide soared up to 336 cases in the first three months of the year – an average of four every day.Not to mention, the need to socialise has caused many to gather illegally, leading to crackdowns by the police, for something as simple as celebrating a birthday.But many experts today agree that it is time to hit the reset button and revive the economy, albeit under cautious circumstances.And that’s why having a new method of ensuring and proving each person is free of infection is crucial.Clear horizonsRecently, AxialHealth has made a game-changing move that might just propel the country back on its feet.As a subsidiary of artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem builder Skymind, AxialHealth was established in 2019 as a response to the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, where it helped develop a technology that transforms healthcare through AI, starting with medical devices, imaging and diagnosis.Today, the AxialHealth Al-based Covid-19 CT Scan diagnosis system is being deployed at the Hospital Tunku Azizah Kuala Lumpur, in order to advance the adoption of analytics and AI in clinical and healthcare research on Covid-19 in Malaysia.Its technology is also being deployed in the United States and the United Kingdom.Jumpstarting the economyEnterprises and businesses have the opportunity to accelerate recovery by embarking on self-initiated efforts that will help them stage a successful comeback through the use of Vpass, a digital health solution using AI technology that would restore normalcy needed to live, play, and work.The solution, which is developed by Skymind in tandem with AxialHealth, validates results from saliva antigen rapid test kits.Alternate day testing is recommended by most health experts globally as it can help reduce the number of Covid-19 infections.This Vpass solution allows enterprises and businesses to do frequent Covid-19 testing of employees and create a Covid-free zone for daily operations.International Infectious Disease microbiologist Prof Mark O’Brien, who is also the chairman of AxialHealth Medical and Scientific Advisory Board, said daily and frequent self-testing of employees using Vpass creates a safer workplace, thus helping to break the chain of infection among the company's staff.Vpass is not just a self-testing kit as it is a total solution that goes beyond Covid-19 infection detection.Using a mobile app and a dashboard in the back-end, the tamper-proof technology confirms user Covid-19 status as either positive or negative.It then provides a health pass to the user that helps enterprises and businesses effectively track employee health codes, and plan and manage work schedules or assignments accordingly.Employees who test negative can carry on with their daily tasks while those positive can be quarantined and treated, thus, protecting their co-workers.This eliminates issues like production delay due to sudden Covid-19 outbreaks, unplanned operations disruption because of sanitisation, and the high cost of having employees take PCR every time an outbreak occurs.AxialHealth Sdn Bhd honorary advisor, Major General (Rtd) Prof Dr Datuk Mohd Zin Bidin highlighted that the Covid-19 pandemic demands a new system of testing that makes a real difference.“A simple, accurate, and cost-effective test is needed for schools, hospitals, factories, airports, and places of worship.“In these trying times, it's urgent that people have access to a rapid test that can verify the authenticity of their results anywhere and at any time.”Skymind group chief executive officer Shawn Tan said, “Even as the vaccines are rolling out successfully in the country, we still need to remain vigilant about the spread of the virus if we want to win the fight against Covid-19.”He added that rapid self-testing can open the door to do business so that employees have income and are able to bring food to the table.“Employees can also protect themselves from getting infected and taking the virus home and transmitting the disease to family members.”Customers would have a greater comfort level in engaging with the business when they are assured that the business premise is free from Covid-19.Tan said the company is willing to give up 100% of the intellectual property licensing fee to assist the Malaysian government in fighting the epidemic.“The

He even contemplated taking his own life after gaining no income for the past year and a half.“I thought about suicide as it felt so sad.

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",9:40 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,This first edition of Mary Shelley's classic book 'Frankenstein' sold for RM4.8mil,"In an unmissable event for literature lovers, auction house Christie's disbanded part of Theodore B. Baum's impressive collection of books on Sept 14.Among them was a first edition of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, which sold for US$1.17mil (RM4.8mil).The literary work far exceeded expectations, as Christie's had initially estimated the book to fetch between US$200,000 (RM832,000) and US$300,000 (RM1.2mil). Bids rose quickly due to the rarity of this version of Frankenstein.According to the auction house, this was the first time that an edition of the novel in the original bindings has appeared at auction since 1985.Moreover, only 500 copies of Frankenstein were printed on Jan 1, 1818, when Mary Shelley first published the work. They all contain a preface written by the author's husband, Percy Shelley, and a dedication to her father, William Godwin.Frankenstein came about during the rainy summer of 1816 on the shores of Lake Geneva, where Mary Shelley and her husband were staying with Lord Byron. Lord Byron had suggested to the group, who had been enjoying reading French translations of German ghost stories, that they each write their own such tale.In the preface to the 1831 edition, Mary Shelley recounts the origins of her best-known novel: ""I busied myself to think of a story - a story to rival those which had excited us to this task. One which would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature, and awaken thrilling horror - one to make the reader dread to look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart.""From Charles Darwin to James JoyceThe Exceptional Literature Collection Of Theodore B. Baum: Part One, held on Sept 14 in New York, saw other exceptional works of literature go under the hammer.Among them, a first edition of Charles Darwin's Origin Of Species, which sold for US$562,500, (RM2.3mil) and a complete copy of William Shakespeare's Second Folio, which sold for US$400,000 (RM1.7mil).Christie's will continue to sell the treasures of the late Theodore B. Baum's book collection in a second dedicated sale, concluding on Sept 17. On this occasion, book lovers and collectors will be able to bid for a copy of James Joyce's ""Dubliners,"" estimated at between US$150,000 (RM624,000) and US$250,000 (approximately RM1.03mil).""Mr Baum built his library over the course of decades, waiting patiently for each title to come on the market, either through private dealers or at auction,"" Heather Weintraub, book and manuscript specialist and head of the sale at Christie's, told Penta.""Nearly every book shares remarkable condition and impeccable provenance."" - AFP"

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",,Business,,Hong Kongers piling into yuan at fast pace,"HONG KONG: Hong Kong residents haven’t been this excited about China’s yuan since before a shock currency devaluation in 2015.Bank customers in the city have added net 163 billion yuan (US$25bil or RM104bil) of savings denominated in the offshore yuan over the past year, about four times the pace of the previous 12 months, according to official data.The last time they bought at a faster rate was in 2014, just before a surprise devaluation saw the currency enter a downward spiral the following year.The scramble for the yuan is being driven by a number of factors, including speculation the currency will continue to strengthen after rising more than 5% against the dollar over the past 12 months. The yuan is also in favour due to Chinese 10-year bond yields that are more than double those on similar-maturity US Treasuries.The build-up of yuan deposits in Hong Kong may get another fillip in the near future with the expected launch of two new channels aiming to boost investment flows between Hong Kong and mainland China.One is the southbound leg of the Bond Connect programme, that will give Chinese investors a route to buy overseas debt.The other is a new Wealth Management Connect facility, which will allow them to purchase investment products in Hong Kong and Macau.“The launch of the connect schemes is further burnishing Hong Kong’s credentials as China’s gateway between East and West, and bodes well for a future build-up of yuan deposits offshore,” said Eddie Cheung, a senior emerging-markets strategist at Credit Agricole SA in Hong Kong.“As offshore yuan deposits grow and the channels through Hong Kong are launched, then we would expect greater offshore yuan turnover.”A key driver of the yuan demand is an expectation it will remain resilient despite the prospect of the Federal Reserve cutting back on bond purchases, a move that should support the dollar.China’s currency is seen being bolstered by robust capital inflows and Beijing’s cautious employment of stimulus. The yuan and Taiwan dollar are the only two Asian currencies to appreciate versus the greenback this year.The offshore yuan was at 6.4391 yesterday after appreciating to 6.3525 in May, the strongest level in three years.Not everyone is convinced yuan deposits in Hong Kong will keep increasing.“The rising trend could be temporary as investors are only taking advantage of higher yields in the yuan and currency appreciation bets,” said Kevin Lai, chief economist at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. “The Chinese yuan is not a freely convertible currency and its liquidity is managed under Beijing’s capital controls.”The yuan is also poised to become less attractive as it will probably start to weaken, he said.Others believe the process now appears irreversible.“As China is firing on all engines for different connects, demand for the offshore yuan to support portfolio flows is bound to increase,” said Raymond Yeung, chief economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd in Hong Kong.“More Chinese local governments are issuing bonds in Hong Kong and enriching the product suite for southbound flows. This will see liquidity conditions improve.” ―Bloomberg"

For quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) review, revenue and pre-tax profit increased by RM32.9mil and RM24.1mil respectively, mainly contributed by 79% increase in crude palm oil price.from RM2,335 per tonne to RM4,183 per tonne,” it said in a filing to Bursa Malaysia yesterday.Subur Tiasa expects its palm oil division to generate higher earnings, underpinned by higher fresh fruit bunches (FFB) production during the peak crop season.“The CPO price is expected to remain firm in line with tight supplies as overall FFB yield per hectare in Malaysia is on the declining trend aggravated by manpower issue and Covid-19 lockdown. This is further supported by tight supplies of rival edible oils due to adverse climatic change,” it said.Subur Tiasa has also signalled further improvement at its currently loss-making timber operations.“The timber segment’s selling price is expected to improved further on the back of rising demand,” it said."

"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",,Business,ZUNAIRA SAIEED,Sticking to the core operations,"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s largest sugar producer MSM Malaysia Holdings Bhd has gathered momentum to further divest its non-core assets as part of the group’s turnaround plan to ensure sustainable growth.The sugar producer’s shareholders gave the nod yesterday to dispose of its entire stake in its wholly-owned subsidiary MSM Perlis Sdn Bhd to FGV Integrated Farming Holdings Sdn Bhd for RM175mil cash.The disposal comprises 11 parcels of agriculture and industrial land, subject to adjustment for net working capital and net debt at completion.MSM Perlis had ceased its plantation operation since September 2019 due to high operating cost for maintenance that resulted in unsustainable financial commitment.Overall, MSM said the disposal of the equity in MSM Perlis is estimated to result in a gain of RM91.6mil.Group chief executive officer Syed Feizal Syed Mohammad said the refiner has also identified some of the plant and machinery assets belonging to MSM Perlis, with a book value of RM50mil, for disposal.“We are putting it up for international tender, we will see what is the best price offer we get at that point of time,” he told reporters during a press conference following the sugar refiner’s EGM yesterday.Syed Feizal added that the group is also planning to sell some parcels of industrial land in the Klang Valley and Johor.However, he explained that the approximate value of the parcels could not be disclosed as they are currently being revalued due to the current market conditions.“MSM is also continuously assessing non-core assets to be divested. The company owns small parcels of industrial land and if there are no strategic need for them, we will put it for sale when the market window is good and try to achieve the best economic value for it,” Syed Feizal noted.Overall, he said the discontinuation of MSM’s non-strategic operations has been a key strategy that is reflected on the group’s financial performance since the fourth quarter of last year.“Strategically, the discontinuation of non-strategic operations consolidated up to 200,000 tonnes of production volume, along with the redeployment of qualified manpower and experts to MSM Johor and our refinery in Penang, MSM Prai Bhd, to accelerate production momentum and further optimise capacity utilisation,” he added.Besides that, he expects MSM Sugar Refinery (Johor) Sdn Bhd to swing back to the black in the first half of next year as the group is confident of achieving the 65% to 70% utilisation factor (UF) by next year.“The Johor refinery needs 50% UF to return back to the black, which is expected by end-year. Once it crosses the 50% mark, it would return back to profitability,” he pointed out.The group’s sugar production at its refinery in Johor for this year and next year are expected to be around 300,000 tonnes and between 500,000 tonnes to 600,000 tonnes, respectively.“We need to ramp up our capacity fast enough to meet the demand in Asia Pacific. It is not short of export orders. We are confident to fulfil this growth,” explained Syed Feizal.On its exports, the group is on track to meet its targets this year as it has already bagged orders of 306,000 tonnes and delivered up to 144,000 tonnes to its customers.“The balance will be delivered by the end of this year. For next year, exports should be above 450,000 tonnes,” said Syed Feizal.With the reopening of more industries in the country, he believes demand for sugar would pick up gradually by 5% to 10% in the second half of this year.“Previously, the Malaysian market consumed 1.5 million tonnes of sugar (a year) but due to the pandemic, consumption dropped to between 1.2 million and 1.3 million tonnes.“I think we will get better next year and we hope Malaysia will achieve the previous consumption rate of 1.5 million next year,” he added.On the price of raw sugar, Syed Feizal expects the bullishness in prices to continue in the short and medium term due to crops being hit by drought and the recent severe frost in Brazil.“Some volume will be affected certainly so there will be less sugar in the market,” he saidHowever, he expects Brazil to get back to its full volume in the next 12 to 18 months.“Towards the end of 2022, we may see prices getting back to at least their normal level,” he said."

Petroleum Brunei and Malaysia's state energy firm Petronas did not respond to requests for comment.A leak was recently discovered at a compressor unit at the Gumusut-Kakap oilfield off Sabah in East Malaysia which had been shut in August for maintenance, the second source said.The unit, which was supposed to resume operations this month, will remain shut until repair works are carried out in November, he said.The loading dates for cargoes originally scheduled to be exported in end-September to November have also been pushed back by three to 12 days, he added.Other stakeholders of Kimanis production include Indonesia's Pertamina, Thailand's PTTEP and ConocoPhillips.Shell operates the two deepwater fields Gumusut-Kakap and Malikai that lie offshore Sabah, capable of producing 170,000 bpd of Kimanis crude at peak.Production of Kimanis crude has been falling in recent years but still makes up the bulk of Malaysia's exports. - Reuters"

Made from pure D24 durian flesh, their signature AT Durian Crepe – sold at hypermarkets and convenience stores, including PETRONAS Kedai Mesra – registered exponential sales growth even during the pandemic.“I must say that Kedai Mesra was my silver lining, enabling me to expand my business to where it is today despite the challenging times,” shared Abdul Razak.Joining as a PETRONAS Dagangan Bhd (PDB) Kedai Mesra supplier in January 2021, AT has today expanded its business to over 300 Kedai Mesra nationwide and also exports to Brunei.For the past 25 years, PDB has been supporting the growth of local businesses under its Local Entrepreneurship Programme, as part of its sustainability agenda. To date, PDB has over 350 local vendors supplying to its Kedai Mesra nationwide, offering a variety of locally produced food and beverage items including kerepek, bakery products, juice, as well as local staples such as nasi lemak and fried noodles.Sweet successEntrepreneur Rose Yasmin Abdul Karim, the co-founder of Pops Malaya, also shares a similar success story after joining the programme in 2016, growing its presence from over 30 Kedai Mesra to more than 790 nationwide.A healthier option for popsicles, Pops Malaya was featured as one of the local brands for the Kempen Beli Barangan Malaysia in 2019, jointly organised by the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs and PDB, which helped to further strengthen its brand presence.“When we kicked off our expansion in 2020, our growth was immediately stunted by the pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns. It was a challenging period and sales were slow.“We were fortunate to have benefitted from PDB’s digital merchandising system during this time, which has helped to simplify the stocking process. We managed to save resources and time instead of manually going to each station, as everything could be easily monitored digitally, from stocks, orders to deliveries,” Yasmin shared.Backed by a strong brandAnother hot-selling snack at Kedai Mesra, Pop Chiz, entered the local petrol mart in October 2020, but has already grown its business to over 400 Kedai Mesra.The brainchild of Edyfaizullah (Edy) Jamil, the addictive snack is made from popiah skin and comes in four unique flavours, including Baba Nyonya Salted Egg, Burito Tomato, Curry Mamak and Rasa Cheese Lebih Padu.Edy attributes his success to being associated with the PETRONAS brand. “Business has improved tremendously since joining Kedai Mesra and our brand is also widely known now thanks to PETRONAS’ extensive network of stations. We plan to expand nationwide by 2022 and to introduce more varieties in the near future,” he said.Dream Car Performance Garage owner Tan Chee Kit also stressed on the importance of having strong backing from a reputable brand, especially when starting a new business from scratch amidst intense market competition.Tan, who was a Mercedes aftersales manager for 14 years, decided to open his own workshop when he chanced upon the offer by PETRONAS AutoExpert, which enables him to leverage PETRONAS branding and its quality lubricants, as well as an all-round solutions scheme including marketing support, effective trade programmes and consultancy for future business development.“Joining hands with a reputable brand like PETRONAS is a strategic decision I made to position my workshop as one that is benchmarked by international standards offering quality products supplied by PETRONAS Lubricants,” Tan said.Located in Puchong, the PETRONAS AutoExpert Dream Car Performance Garage boasts a 7,000 sq ft workshop with eight working bays, offering a one-stop centre service including repair, service, diagnosis and bodyworks for continental performance cars.Though the road to recovery may be long, PDB believes in hope and continues to instill national pride in the country's pool of talents and capabilities, by empowering them in the spirit of togetherness to rebuild the nation.Its Love Local Campaign, which echoes the Government’s rallying call for Malaysians in line with the Kempen Beli Barangan Malaysia to support and buy local products, hopes to create greater awareness for local brands with quality offerings comparable to those of global brands.To find out more about the Love Local Campaign promotion, or for those interested in becoming one of PDB’s local suppliers, visit https://www.mymesra.com.my/"

The other team will be the third-placed side from the Premier League.However, Perak, who last hoisted the Cup in 2018, are no longer a force they used to be after they were relegated from the Super League for the first time in 31 years. Terengganu and Selangor should advance to the last eight as the top two finishers.Group A promises to be an explosive affair as it pits Penang, Kuala Lumpur and Pahang, who boast 11 Malaysia Cup titles between them.To date, first-placed Negri Sembilan and second-placed Sarawak are the only two Premier League sides confirmed of their Malaysia Cup spots. The remaining three will see a battle between Police, Kuching United, Kelantan and Kelantan United."
"Thursday, 16 Sep 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Tech,NOAH BUHAYAR，MARK BERGEN,Alphabet’s Waymo expands in San Francisco with Uber lease,"Waymo, the autonomous vehicle unit owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc, is taking more office space in San Francisco.The company is subleasing more than 48,000 square feet (4,460 square meters) at 555 Market Street in the city’s financial district from Uber Technologies Inc. Waymo already has space in the Bayview neighbourhood, while Google has several offices in the city.The new lease for Waymo is a vote of confidence for an office market that has been slower to rebound from the pandemic than other major US cities, with technology employers embracing remote and hybrid work. While Google has maintained its space in San Francisco, many other tech companies have sought to offload millions of square feet they previously leased.“We’re excited to expand into this new beautiful space right on Market Street,” Boris Sofman, the head of trucking and perception at Waymo, said in a statement Wednesday. “Our teams will return to the office in a variety of modes from full to hybrid to remote over months to come, and this new space will allow us to support not only our growing operations in San Francisco but also globally.”Waymo, widely considered the technical leader in autonomous driving, has been offering fully driverless taxi rides in Arizona for the past year. Yet the company’s expansion elsewhere has moved slower than industry expectations and its earlier plans.In August, the company began opening taxi services to select passengers in San Francisco, but those rides will include a safety driver at the wheel. The company has also announced a partnership with J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc to work on autonomous trucking in Texas.Alphabet was an early investor in Uber. But in 2017, Waymo sued Uber and accused the company of using trade secrets for its self-driving program taken from a Waymo engineer, Anthony Levandowski, who had moved to the ride-hailing company.The companies settled the following year, with Uber agreeing to pay Waymo US$245mil (RM1.01bil). – Bloomberg"

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",,Metro,VIJENTHI NAIR,Groups welcome timely urban farming guideline,"URBAN farming is growing in popularity, especially now during the Covid-19 pandemic.Many people are spending more time at home and taking up farming as a resourceful hobby, while some are also earning an income from selling the produce.While the authorities encourage the activity, some farms are being cultivated in areas that are not meant for such projects, thus disrupting the surroundings.To regulate the activity, Housing and Local Government Ministry launched the Urban Community Farming Policy (UCFP) on Aug 3 as a guide for individuals or groups interested in pursuing such projects.The National Landscape Department, an agency under the ministry, is the policy executioner.Its director-general Rotina Mohd Daik said that despite a high number of urban gardens, the communities that managed them lacked knowledge on proper management, growing methods, maintenance and sustainable practices, among others.She said the department’s involvement in an earlier initiative by the ministry called Rakan Taman that was closely related to urban community farming, showed that these communities faced problems and challenges from the start.“Many started gardens on illegal sites, grew unsuitable plants and had poor knowledge of garden tools and uses.“That was when the idea for UCFP first came about,” she said.Rotina said the main objective of the policy was to develop urban community farms in an organised, systematic and sustainable manner in urban areas.“In this community garden policy, guidelines are also provided for the community to carry out urban gardening activities.“The policy touches on suitable farming areas, the processes of obtaining permission from the landowner and local authority, and includes advice on must-have elements of an urban farm such as boundaries between crops, compost site, crop rotation practices, watering methods and maintenance.“Individuals wanting to grow vegetables or fruits in their house compounds need not seek any permission from the authorities.“However, individuals or groups wanting to start a garden in a common area or any available space belonging to others, must seek the proper approvals.“This is to avoid instances of people taking over spaces in prohibited areas such as recreational sites and children’s playgrounds.“The policy also touches on the type of crops suitable for urban gardens, among which are eggplant, lemongrass, carrot, cucumber and kale,” she elaborated.Rotina said Housing and Local Government Ministry hoped that the policy would increase gardening activities in urban areas in a more systematic and tidy manner, which in turn would increase social integration among the urban community.She said the department would work closely with local councils to ensure the policy served local communities well as a guideline for those interested in creating their own urban farms.“Residents associations, joint management bodies for strata properties and non-governmental organisations are encouraged to register their urban farm initiatives with the local authorities.“Registered organisations will be able to receive support and guidance from the authorities.“Some may even get financial aid for start-up capital from local authorities and the relevant agencies to jumpstart community garden projects,” she added.Right time for guidePersatuan Lestari Alam Malaysia chairman Rashdan Rashid said the launch of UCFP was a step in the right direction, as there was a growing interest in such projects.Rashdan, who is also Kuala Lumpur urban farming chairman under the Local Agenda 21 (LA 21) programme managed by Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL), said there were over 100 applications for urban farms that were awaiting approval since the Covid-19 pandemic started.He said the approval process had been delayed because there was not enough officers in the task force to oversee the setting up and operations of such farms.“Setting up a sustainable urban farm needs proper planning, otherwise it will fail.“Under the LA 21 programme, we help them choose the site, provide training in capacity building, teach them how to operate as a social enterprise and assess their projects biannually,” he explained.Rashdan said participants would also learn about the circular economy.“Many wait for grants to set up a farm, but we encourage them to raise funds by selling recyclable items.“Once the farm is up, we educate them on rainwater harvesting for watering crops, making compost as fertilisers and organic farming for health and benefits to the environment.“Apart from just selling the produce at markets, we also teach them to make products out of the fresh produce,” he added.Some groups, Rashdan revealed, recorded sales of up to RM300 a month.“Part of the sales can be put back into the farm,” he advised.However, from the 84 registered urban farms, he noted that only about 20% met the sustainable standards.He stressed that regulations were also important to control farming activities in the city.“Some farms are being cultivated in children’s playgrounds and recreational areas, which is not fair to others.“Another example of poor urban farming practice is siting the project below high-tension cables.“Although allowed, many do not seek approval from the landowner and they plant the wrong type of crops.“With a policy in place, such practices could be avoided,” he said.Thriving community farmsTaman Tun Dr Ismail Edible Community Garden chairperson Margaret Lee agreed that with regulations, problems could be nipped in the bud.When residents started the project on a vacant plot along Lorong Burhanuddin Helmi 11 in 2017, it had a smooth kick-off as they were guided by the LA 21 programme.“As a result, we have a thriving vegetable garden and have planted a variety of fruit trees.“We use organic methods and our produce is snapped up quickly by the community.“We also make and sell compost.“Prior to that, there were groups that started smaller gardens but failed to sustain them,” she said.Latiff Abu Hassan, who heads the Neighbourhood Garden Project at Seri Perlis 2 Flats in Kampung Datuk Keramat, Kuala Lumpur, is also of the view that communities will benefit from the policy.He said the flats residents’ garden project was initiated in 2015 under an Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry programme.It was to encourage the community to grow their own crops as a way of reducing living expenses.However, it was only through a LA 21 programme that Seri Perlis 2 flats residents learned how to cultivate crops using sustainable methods, said Latiff.“Our crops are flourishing.“We have groups that plant different types of vegetables.“We sell the produce at the market and profits are ploughed back into the housing corporation for the benefit of residents.“The project also keeps residents, especially the older generation, active and healthy.”He said cash incentives were given to the groups that achieved their target for the month.“I hope more communities will take up urban farming because there is much to be gained.“It brings people together and promotes neighbourliness,” Latiff added."

It will be through mobile vaccine administration centres (PPVs) for underserved communities including urban and rural poor, Orang Asli, homeless and marginalised communities, outreach vaccination (house visits) focusing on people who have limited access to PPV or have restricted mobility including the bedridden, disabled and sick, and static PPV with Mercy Malaysia as the healthcare organiser.Meanwhile, Maybank group chief human capital officer Datuk Nora Manaf said everyone had a role to play in significantly reducing cases while learning to go about their lives safely by observing new interaction rules. In line with this, Maybank group has continuously encouraged its employees to do their part in the fight against Covid-19.“From ensuring they are made aware of safety and health protocols to protect themselves, our customers and communities, to encouraging them to live a healthy lifestyle and being a force of good in their communities, we want them to live out our purpose of humanising financial services each day.“Like all Malaysians, we look forward to coming out economically and socially stronger and better from the pandemic, so that together we can work for a brighter and more sustainable future for all,” she added."

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",,Metro,JADE CHAN,KL’s bird park all set to soar again,"TUCKED within the lush grounds of Perdana Botanical Gardens is KL Bird Park, a unique attraction located close to Kuala Lumpur city centre.Touted as the world’s largest free-flight walk-in aviary, it was designed to give visitors a chance to view the birds in close proximity, in a semi-natural environment.The park was officially opened on Feb 10, 1991, and first managed by Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL).“Safari Bird Park and Wonderland Sdn Bhd took over its management in 2000, and manages both KL Bird Park and Hornbill Restaurant and Cafe,” said the company’s marketing and promotions executive Taufik Mohd Sharif, adding that DBKL was still the landowner.The park is divided into four zones and features over 3,000 birds comprising 200 local and foreign species.Highlights include Hornbill Park which houses the great hornbill, Asian black hornbill and Sarawak’s state bird the rhinoceros hornbill; Free Flying Bird Zone where storks, egrets, ibises and peafowls mingle freely; as well as World Of Parrots where visitors can view these colourful creatures up close.The education centre and bird school were later additions to the three-decade-old park. They allow visitors to learn about Malaysian birds and their life cycle (and view live hatchings if they are lucky) as well as understand the relationship between birds and human beings.“We have an on-site curator and veterinarian who work together to manage and care for the birds,” said Taufik.“The curator manages and does the inventory of the birds. His duty includes daily checks to monitor their number and condition.“The veterinarian takes care of the health of the birds. Certain birds are tagged to monitor their health and other concerns.”On the rare occasion that a bird escapes the park, he said employees would be sent to track down and catch it.“Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, park visitors comprised 70% foreigners and 30% locals, most of whom reside outside the Klang Valley.“With the travel restrictions and international border closures, the visitors are now 99% Malaysians and 1% expatriates or foreigners on long-term stay in Malaysia.“When interstate travel was allowed during the recovery movement control order last year, the ratio of local visitors who came from the Klang Valley and other states was about 50:50,” he added.Taufik said the Covid-19 pandemic and drop in tourist numbers had an impact on the bird park’s operating costs.“Its income comes from ticket sales, souvenirs and food and beverage kiosks. The restaurant is run as a separate business.“As for visitors, we are only getting half of the number compared to pre-Covid-19 days.“To address that, the management had to reduce usage of non-essential operations matters, such as switching off air-conditioners in the education centre (during movement restriction periods when no visitors were allowed),” he said, adding that the park also had to do away with part-time and contract staff.The park reopened on Sept 10 when restrictions were lifted after Kuala Lumpur moved to Phase Two of the National Recovery Plan.Taufik urged visitors to continue being mindful of adhering to standard operating procedures.“We welcome the public to visit and support local tourism. But they must be responsible tourists.“People tend to forget about physical distancing when taking photos or watching the bird show.“They are also not allowed to take anything out of the park for hygiene reasons, not even if they find a dropped feather on the ground,” he said.He highlighted that the ticket purchase process was made as seamless as possible to reduce crowding.Lana Ishika Shashinathan and her family were among those who enjoyed a fun day out at the park on a weekday back when it was open in March.“I liked the parrots because they can talk! I hope to get an orange parrot as a pet,” said the five-year-old.Her parents Shashinathan Selvanathan, 41, and Shivani Vijayakumar, 36, said the outing was a reward for Lana Ishika for doing well in kindergarten.“We gave her options to experience other attractions, and she chose the bird park because of her fascination with nature.“This is our first time here and we never realised it is so big,” said Shashinathan, adding that they were impressed by the attraction and its clean condition.Some of the activities park visitors can look out for are the bird feeding sessions held across various zones as well as bird show at the amphitheatre.These are held at specific times, so visitors keen to catch the sessions are advised to plan their visits accordingly.A day-long photo opportunity with some of the more colourful parrots, cockatoos, conures and macaws is also available at a dedicated photo booth.The entire site is wheelchair- and stroller-friendly, except for its amphitheatre.Entry to the park is only for fully vaccinated individuals with low-risk status. Children are allowed to enter when accompanied by fully vaccinated parents.Admission rate for Malaysians with MyKad is RM25 per adult and RM12 per child/senior citizen. Entry is free for disabled individuals.Entry to the park, when it is allowed to open, is only for fully vaccinated individuals.*KL Bird Park is temporarily closed under Phase Two of the National Recovery Plan, in accordance with National Security Council guidelines.

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",,Metro,BAVANI M.,Brickfields folk question safety of decade-old bridges,"A MEETING between Kuala Lumpur City Hall’s (DBKL) Project Implementation Department and stakeholders from Brickfields to discuss the viability of an underutilised foot bridge on Jalan Tun Sambanthan revealed that the structure was never handed over to DBKL.Concerns were raised as to whether that bridge as well as others in the area were certified by Occupational Safety and Health Department (DOSH), but DBKL officers at the meeting were unable to confirm this as the projects were done 10 years ago.When contacted, DBKL Road Transport Department director Yu Chuan Hock confirmed that contractors never handed the bridges over to City Hall.“It’s true. They were not handed over to us, and from checks with my counterparts in the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Department, they confirmed that there was no handover process,” said Yu.The Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Department is in charge of lift maintenance work while the bridges are under the purview of DBKL’s Road Transport Department.“We have checked with the other units and no one knows why there was no handover, as the bridges were built a very long time ago and it was a corporate social responsibility project,” said Yu.When asked if the bridges were DOSH-certified, he said: “We are still trying to find out about that.“Many want the bridge and lifts (on Jalan Tun Sambanthan) to be retained but they do not accept that the lifts are in bad condition.“Some want the lift shafts removed but the bridge maintained.“We will proceed with a second engagement session with stakeholders to discuss the next course of action, compile feedback and take it to the One-Stop Centre committee,” he added.Residents were told by DBKL executive director Datuk Azmi Abdul Hamid at the meeting that the project was never handed over to City Hall.Upon enquiring if the three bridges in Brickfields built with lift shaft were DOSH-certified, officers from the mechanical department fell silent.This irked stakeholders as they pressed for more details.“I was shocked to learn that the bridges were never handed to DBKL and the possibility that they may not be DOSH-certified is worse,” said United Tapah Resources Sdn Bhd director Yuvapandian Ramasamy.“It explains why the bridges and the lifts were not maintained and were underutilised,” he said.Yuvapandian, whose pawn shop is blocked by the lift shaft structure, is among those who wants the lift shaft removed as it is never used by the public.StarMetro recently reported that following the demolition of a pedestrian bridge in front of Malaysian Association for the Blind in Brickfields, including the removal of a lift shaft of another bridge in Jalan Sultan Abdul Samad in June, DBKL received requests from business owners for the Jalan Tun Sambanthan foot bridge lift shafts to be removed.The bridge is located in front of Restaurant Saravanaa Bhavan and a pawn shop as well as across the Shell building along the Brickfields’ main road.The lift to the bridge on Jalan Tun Sambanthan has also been locked and inaccessible since its completion.Echoing Yuvapandian’s sentiment is Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin Malaysia president S. Gunasekaran, who wants the lifts to be removed.“It does not serve any purpose at all,’’ he said.In 2010, DBKL announced that it would build the bridges to benefit the community, including the visually-impaired.Five bridges were built along Jalan Tun Sambanthan and Jalan Sultan Abdul Samad at a cost of over RM10mil.Three of the bridges, costing over RM2mil each, were installed with six lifts meant for the disabled to use.However, most of them became white elephants with stakeholders pushing for DBKL to remove them."
"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",,Metro,FARID WAHAB,‘Covid-19 virus not likely to infect residents living nearby cemeteries’,"CEMETERIES where Covid-19 victims are buried are unlikely to pose a threat of infections to nearby communities, as the virus is no longer infective.Former deputy Health director-general Prof Datuk Dr Lokman Hakim Sulaiman said although a viral genome could be detected inside a body long after the onset of infection, the virus would no longer be viable.He said various studies had indicated that such specimens showed no growth when cultured in a laboratory.“This is why Covid-19 patients who show clinical improvements will be discharged between 10 and 14 days, without undergoing another test.“The genome is still inside the surviving patients, but the virus is already dead,” he told StarMetro.A video widely circulated early this month showed water runoff from Bukit Kiara Muslim cemetery in Kuala Lumpur, flowing into an adjacent waterway during a downpour.The two-minute clip claimed that the water runoff could cause new infections to break out among the residents in a nearby condominium.Prof Lokman explained that even if the virus were still alive after the patient died, which he stressed was “very unlikely”, it would not infect anyone.“The victim is no longer breathing, so how could the virus exit the respiratory system?“It will perish with the body,” he stressed.Universiti Malaya virologist Prof Dr Sazaly Abu Bakar supported the explanation, saying that the virus could only replicate inside the cells of a living host.“It will disintegrate just like a corpse.“The virus outside the body is not infective because it has been inactivated by disinfectants,” he said.Water quality specialist Dr Zaki Zainudin said although water from a cemetery might contain heavy metals and organics, it was unlikely to contain active viruses.“At worse, there may be fragments of genomic materials of the virus, but these are likely already dead.“The World Health Organisation has also said that Covid-19 does not transmit through water,” he pointed out.Universiti Putra Malaysia epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman said that so far, no Covid-19 infections had been traced to cemeteries or water bodies.Bukit Kiara Muslim cemetery has been a burial site for many individuals who died from Covid-19 since March last year.Federal Territories Islamic Religious Department director Datuk Mohd Ajib Ismail said the cemetery received bodies of locals and those from Hospital Kuala Lumpur.He said the department’s charity and volunteer unit worked closely with the Civil Defence Department and Health Ministry to carry out the funerals.“Burials are carried out from 9am until night every day.“Our team will ensure that the bodies are buried according to religious rites.“All our personnel abide by the procedures that have been set by the district health office, such as wearing personal protective equipment and frequent sanitation,” he said."

We hope they will get it right from the Denmark Open onwards,” said Chong Ming.The other pairs under his care are Pearly Tan-M. Thinaah, Yap Ling-Pei Kee, Teoh Mei Xing-Anna Cheong and Valeree Siow-Low Yeen Yuan. His youngest pair Valeree-Yeen Yuan did well to win the Latvia International title last month while Valeree was also impressive in the mixed doubles with Yap Roy Ying as they won all the three back-to-back stints in Europe - Latvia, Greece and Ukraine.“Except for Meng Yean and Cheng Wen, the others are playing in their first major tournaments in the Sudirman Cup and Uber Cup Finals,” said Chong Ming.“I want Meng Yean to show leadership and encourage the other youngsters to step up.“All the first-timers may be inexperienced but I don’t want them to be mere passengers in the team. I expect all of them to give their opponents a good fight.“They’ve trained hard as the others and it’s time to translate the hard work into a good showing,” he added.Malaysia will be banking on Swiss Open champions Pearly Tan-M.

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",,Sport,RAJES PAUL,Mee Fen hopes Jin Wei will rethink about her decision to quit,"PETALING JAYA: Former two-time national champion Ng Mee Fen’s biggest disappointment in her badminton career was not fulfilling her full potential.And she hopes that the 21-year-old Goh Jin Wei will rethink her call to quit as she may live to regret it too.On Monday, Jin Wei pulled off a shocker by announcing her retirement due to a health reason but there was also a tinge of disappointment in her voice as she spoke of a dream – of playing in the Sudirman Cup and Uber Cup Finals but the BA of Malaysia have only chosen her for the latter event.The 39-year-old Mee Fen has been following the two-time world junior champion Jin Wei’s rapid rise from a junior to the country’s top women’s player.In fact, Jin Wei became the second youngest player to win the national title at 16 – just six months short of beating Mee Fen’s record of being the youngest player to do so in 1998.Mee Fen bemoaned a call she had made in the past – and hoped Jin Wei was not making the same mistake.“I had qualified for the 2000 Sydney Olympics on merit but I chose to sit for my SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia) that year,” said Mee Fen, who holds a degree in psychology and currently pursuing her Masters in counseling at the Open University Malaysia (OUM).“I was young and naive. I thought I had plenty of good years ahead of me but I didn’t.“I was bugged with injuries that saw me missing the 2004 Athens Olympics.“I chose to retire after that due to combination of several factors – injury, lack of will as my father had passed away then and he was the reason why I had played badminton, and the lack of opportunities.“So I was unable to catch up with other youngsters like Wong Mew Choo.“For a player, who has trained hard from young, the biggest regret is not being able to fulfil one’s potential.”“I’ve met many players over the years, who have left the national team with much regrets. There are some things that they can’t control – the training environment, injuries, coaching styles. They feel helpless and feel trapped.“I’ve had wished for a better environment, support, system and opportunity too.”Mee Fen hopes Jin Wei will settle down and rethink her decision.“I’m not sure what’s the root cause. Is it just health issue or she lacks the motivation because of the environment. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected many, it affects one’s mental state,” she said.“Right now, Jin Wei just want to hang up her racquet, looks like there is no fire in her.“I hope she will reconsider when she settles down. If health is really an issue, she can take time to recover and switch to mixed doubles or play as a professional player.“She is a rare talent. It’s hard to find a gem like her in the women’s department. She is not only skilful but plays intelligently. I truly hope her talent will not go to waste.”"

Shahriman Zaharudin was delighted with the gesture demonstrated by OSK Foundation.“I must admit, this is one of the largest contributions by a single private organisation to honour our para athletes and PCM.“I sincerely hope more corporate organisations will step forward to complement the government’s efforts to promote sports movement for the 15% of our society who are categorised as persons with disability in our country,” he said.The ceremony, held online via zoom, was also attended by the National Sports Council (NSC) Paralympic Division director Mohd Sofian Hamzah and PCM secretary general Datuk R.

The doctor had to place him on drips to relieved him from the pain. However, he was discharge on the same day.When speaking to mStar, The Star’s Malay-language portal, Almy shared that her husband had previously weighed 84kg and wanted to lose some weight before filming started. “The doctor said he had gastric problems because he hadn’t eaten properly for almost two weeks,” she explained. “He had a lot of acid in his stomach.”Almy also added that the Munafik actor had already been experiencing some stomach problems for the past two weeks. This had caused him to lose about 6kg during that time. “Now God has granted him his intention to lose weight, but at the cost of illness.”Fizz had announced back in June that his wife was pregnant with their fourth child. The couple have been married since 2014 and have three young daughters."
"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,'Worn Out' - Dutch museum finds rare Van Gogh drawing of tired old man,"A Dutch museum on Thursday unveiled a previously unknown work by Vincent van Gogh - a study for one of his best-known drawings, Worn Out - in which an old man sits in a chair with his head in his hands.Van Gogh ""was really interested in the ordinary person, he was also looking to express emotion,"" said Van Gogh Museum Director Emilie Gordenker.""I think we’re all coming out of the Covid period feeling like this and the amazing thing is that we can share this with our visitors. We’re open, we’re delighted to be open.”Discoveries of works by the famously troubled artist, who died in 1890, are extremely rare. The drawing is owned by a private collector and had never been known of or displayed.""So when (the owner) came to the museum it was a big surprise,"" said Senior Researcher Teio Meenendorp, adding that the piece was relatively easy to authenticate. The 50cm x 30cm (20 x 12 inch) work was done with Van Gogh's favourite drawing tool, a carpenter's pencil, in his distinctive style, on water-marked paper from 1877.It closely resembles the more famous Old Man drawing, but the perspective is at eye-level with the old man, rather than from above.The work can be dated with unusual precision to the last weeks of November 1882, Meenendorp said, because of two letters Van Gogh wrote on Nov 24 of that year. It was a period of relative stability for the artist while he was living with a woman in The Hague.One letter was to his brother Theo, saying he had made two drawings of ""an old man with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands"" and that he was thinking of making it into a lithograph.""What a fine sight an old working man makes, in his patched bombazine suit with his bald head,"" Vincent wrote.The other letter was to a fellow artist, saying with confidence he planned to make a lithograph of the theme. Van Gogh did make the lithograph, titled At Eternity's Gate, three days later, on Nov 27, 1882.Meenendorp said Van Gogh had given the works English titles partly in hopes his drawings might be noticed and lead to a job for him as an illustrator for a magazine.That never happened. Van Gogh had little commercial success while he was alive, despite winning great acclaim later.The Dutch artist was troubled by mental illness and considered himself a failure. He returned to the theme with an oil painting known as Sorrowing Old Man, based on the lithograph, two months before his own death.Van Gogh died on July 29, 1890, of a self-inflicted gun wound. - Reuters"

They can only move within a radius of 2.7 kilometres from the border. Apart from that, they can only stay in hotels recommended by the Safety and Health Administration (SHA),” he told Bernama.Last June, Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha announced Thailand will reopen its borders to international visitors within 120 days or by mid-October.Under the ""Phuket Sandbox” programme, Phuket has welcomed 26,400 visitors from July 1 to August 31, generating 1.63 billion Baht in revenue.Thailand also launched ""Samui Plus"", where tourists have the opportunity to visit Koh Samui, Koh Pha-ngan and Koh Tao since last July 15. The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said the programme, up to Aug 31, received 918 visitors and 6,329 room bookings, as well as a revenue of 37.6 million Baht.In an effort to revive the tourism industry, Thailand also plans to reopen more popular tourist destinations including Bangkok and four other provinces - namely Chonburi, Phetchaburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan and Chiang Mai - in October.Meanwhile, Songkhla Province Tourism Industry Council vice-president Aida Oujeh hoped the Thai government could speed up the vaccination campaign in Songkhla province, especially in Danok, so that it will achieve group immunity in the near future.""So far, the Covid-19 vaccine injection (rate) in Danok is only 30 to 35 per cent,"" said Aida, adding that tourist guides, taxi drivers, tuk-tuks and tourist vans should be vaccinated. - Bernama"
"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",10:05 PM MYT,Tech,PAN PYLAS,British computing inventor Clive Sinclair dies at 81,"LONDON: Clive Sinclair, the British inventor and entrepreneur who arguably did more than anyone else to inspire a whole generation of children into a life-long passion for computers and gaming, has died. He was 81.Sinclair, who rose to prominence in the early 1980s with a series of affordable home computers that offered millions their first glimpse into the world of coding as well as the adrenaline rush of playing games on screens, died on Thursday morning after a long battle with cancer.Though ailing, his daughter Belinda Sinclair said, he was still working on inventions up until last week.“He was inventive and imaginative and for him it was exciting and an adventure, it was his passion,” she told the BBC.Born in 1940 in the plush southwest London suburb of Richmond, Sinclair left school at the age of 17 and became a technical journalist before deciding he – and the world – would be better off if he used his brainpower to come up with inventions himself.Aged 22, he formed Sinclair Radionics, his first company, making mail-order radio kits, including the smallest transistor radio in the world. He really came to prominence in 1973 with the world’s first pocket calculator, before turning his sights and passions into transitioning the world of computers to the confines of the home.He became a much-beloved figure in Britain and around the world, for his successes – as well as occasional failures. Tributes poured in from modern-day equivalents such as Elon Musk as well as countless “normal” people who first got hooked on computers and gaming via one of Sinclair's inventions.Sinclair launched his first affordable consumer computer in 1980, which cost less than £100 (US$135 or RM574). The ZX80, which could subsequently be upgraded to the ZX81 with a bit more memory, may not have been sophisticated in today’s terms, but it broke new ground, opening up a world of new opportunities.“The ZX81 was my introduction to computing and I loved it!,” the science broadcaster Prof Brian Cox said in a tweet.In 1982 came the iconic ZX Spectrum, which was certainly a step-change from its predecessors and which would not look too out of place today. Through the 1980s, it took its place in an increasingly crowded marketplace against the likes of the Commodore 64, the first Apple computers as well as those from Atari.The Spectrum went on to become Britain’s best-selling computer. Not only did it help Sinclair become a multimillionaire, it made him a household name at a time the British economy was undergoing a radical transformation under then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1983.“RIP, Sir Sinclair. I loved that computer,” Tesla CEO Musk said in a tweet.The benefits of the Spectrum – and its peers – were felt far and wide, leading to a boom in companies that produced software and hardware. Not to mention the shops that were selling these home computers and all their add-ons.British business mogul Alan Sugar, who was one of the main protagonists in this new era of home technology with his company Amstrad, paid tribute to his “good friend and competitor”.“What a guy he kicked started consumer electronics in the UK with his amplifier kits then calculators, watches mini TV and of course the Sinclair ZX. Not to forget his quirky electric car. R.I.P Friend,” he said on Twitter.For many people, Sinclair will be best remembered for that “quirky” Sinclair C5, an ill-fated electric tricycle heralded as the future of eco-friendly transport but which turned out to be an expensive flop.“It was the ideas, the challenge, that he found exciting,” Sinclair’s daughter said. “He’d come up with an idea and say, ‘There’s no point in asking if someone wants it, because they can’t imagine it’.” – AP"

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",11:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,From Covid to Ida: Louisiana's marginalised 'see no way out',"Darkness set in for Natasha Blunt well before Hurricane Ida knocked out power across Louisiana, the United States.Months into the pandemic, she faced eviction in New Orleans. She lost her banquet hall job. She suffered two strokes. And she struggled to help her five-year-old grandson keep up with schoolwork at home.Like nearly a fifth of Louisiana’s population – disproportionately represented by Black residents and women – Blunt, 51, lives below the poverty line, and the pandemic's economic fallout sent her to the brink. With the help of an aid group and grassroots donors, she moved to Chalmette, a few miles outside New Orleans, and started settling into a two-bedroom apartment.Using a cane and taking a slew of medications since her strokes, she couldn't return to work. But federal benefits kept food in the fridge for the most part.Then came Hurricane Ida.Ida was the fifth-strongest hurricane to ever hit the US mainland, wiping out Louisiana's power grid before marching up the coast and sparking devastating northeast flooding.Among survivors of the deadly storm, the toll has been deepest in many ways for people like Blunt – those who already lost livelihoods to the pandemic in a region of longstanding racial and social inequality.Advocates say the small wins they’d made for marginalised communities and people of colour since the pandemic began have been quickly wiped out.""The government is really disconnected from what it’s like for people who have little to no safety net,” said Maggie Harris, a grassroots organiser who created a fundraiser for Blunt.""You marginalise people, you don’t pay them enough, they have health problems and aren’t insured, you offer little cash assistance or rent assistance, and you allow them to be evicted. The message that people get is their lives are expendable.”As Ida approached, Blunt evacuated to a hotel. She could afford only a short stay and had to return to Chalmette, despite warnings not to go back to humid cities without power.Her apartment was pitch black. Ida had blown in the windows of her upstairs bedroom. Beds, clothing and furniture were waterlogged. She’d spent her last dollars getting to the hotel.""It’s like I’ve got to start all over again,” Blunt said, sobbing as she surveyed her first floor, where she sleeps since the bedroom is uninhabitable. ""Every time I get a step ahead, I get pushed back down. And I’m tired. I don’t see no way out.”Blunt faces eviction for the second time in a year. Her only hope, she said, is Social Security and other disability benefits. She applied before Ida, she said, but hasn't heard back – safety-net programmes are often disrupted in disasters' wakes.Blunt wants to move, perhaps away from the storm-battered Gulf Coast – somewhere grandson Kamille can resume schooling without worrying about power outages. But she’s far from optimistic.""This is the end of the road; I can’t go on much longer,” she said. Kamille put down a worksheet to rub his grandma’s leg.""Don’t cry,” he told her. She managed a tender reply: ""Do your ABCs, baby.”Resilience and oppressionAnti-poverty advocates in Louisiana bemoan links between being Black or brown, living in impoverished areas, and being underserved by governmental disaster response. Available aid from anti-poverty programmes often fails to meet storm victims' heightened needs.That's what happened during Ida, advocates say. In Louisiana, where 17 storms that caused at least US$1bil (RM4.15bil) in damage have hit since 2000, nonprofits see some of the most dire need and starkest divide along socioeconomic lines.""One of the things that we get really frustrated about,"" said Ashley Shelton of the nonprofit Power Coalition for Equality and Justice, ""is people saying, ‘Ugh, Louisiana is so resilient'.""We don’t want to be resilient forever,” she said. ""When you force people to live in a constant state of resilience, it’s just oppression. Fix the systems.”It doesn’t help that Louisiana’s poverty rate is higher than the national average, according to the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. Poverty makes the prospect of relocation precarious for people who were already struggling before disaster struck, said Andreanecia Morris of HousingNOLA, a programme of the Greater New Orleans Housing Alliance.""Housing is a foundational issue for all of these catastrophes,” Morris said. ""Our failure to address racial bias, gender bias and poverty bias in housing impedes all of those things.”After Ida hit, Morris canvassed areas of New Orleans. In the Lower Ninth Ward, a neighbourhood that suffered immensely after Hurricane Katrina, 57-year-old Lationa Kemp found herself cut off from most aid. She'd been relying on neighbours with cars for ice, meals and water. She was without power, with roof leaks and fence damage.Kemp had disputes with her landlord over the home’s condition. The threat of eviction loomed. Morris wants to get Kemp moved elsewhere permanently. In the meantime, Morris suggested a cooling centre.""Thank you, baby, but I’m fine,” Kemp told her, explaining that she’d rather stay in a dilapidated home – past experiences make her fear the shelter system.""I’m praying that when I leave here, I’m going to a better house.”Need for stabilityBlunt has survived her share of storms – starting with her birth during the fallout of Hurricane Camille in 1969. As she tells it, her pregnant mother had been moved to a naval medical ship. Today, Blunt chuckles over the coincidence of her grandson’s name, Kamille.Remembering Katrina is scarier. Blunt evacuated, then returned to a damaged home. But Ida's been worse.""This here was my worst-ever life experience, coming back to this, coming back to darkness,” she said.Blunt has considered leaving, as many Louisianans do in the wake of storms. No matter where she ends up, though, she knows she'll survive.Even in the darkness, she finds some light by helping her community – seeking a power source for a neighbour's breathing machine, sharing her car for charging cellphones.She tells herself: ""I’m still standing.”She wants more not just for her, but for her grandson. ""I want us to go somewhere better,"" Blunt said, helping Kamille with the TV remote, the power finally restored at home.""Somewhere I can be stable. I just want to be stable.” – AP"

They are considered to be at a lower risk of infection compared with those issued with a health risk warning.They may scan their NRIC or FIN to collect a pack containing three ART kits at the vending machines, and use them for self-testing to fulfil the requirement for a health risk warning.Those who receive a health risk warning SMS notification must get a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a Swab and Send Home (Sash) clinic or private practitioner, and self-isolate until they receive a negative result from their first PCR test.Private practitioners that offer the PCR tests are Fullerton Health Testing Centre, Raffles Hospital or Kingsway Medical Clinic, said MOH. Appointments can be made at this website.People issued with health risk warnings will also be required to perform self-administered ART tests on the third, fifth and seventh day from the day of last exposure to the Covid-19 case whom they were close contacts with.They must also do another PCR test on or after the eighth day at a Sash clinic or private practitioner, said MOH.""If all these are complied with, their HRW (health risk warning) period will end on the 10th day of exposure. All swab costs will be borne by the Government,"" said MOH.The ministry said that those who receive a health risk alert SMS notification from Saturday should perform a self-administered ART on the first, third and fifth day from the day of last exposure.They should also monitor their health until the 10th day of exposure.""We urge all on HRA (health risk alert) to exercise social responsibility and limit their interactions with other persons during that period,"" added MOH.ART kits have been distributed to residential households since Aug 28.About 90 per cent of households will have received their self-test kits by next Monday, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung in a virtual press conference by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19 on Friday.Schools and companies have also been given the kits, he noted.""I encourage everyone to do the self-tests... I think using them will be a new habit in this Covid-19 new normal,"" he said.The ARTs are not as accurate as PCR tests, but they can help to pick up cases quickly and prevent onward transmission of the virus, he added. - The Straits Times/ANN"

We give you infinite thanks,"" said Macron.'Really alive'Protective barriers will be removed on Saturday, allowing the public to get up close to the transformed monument.The wrapping will then stay in place until Oct 3.""Christo always said the hardest part is getting the permissions,"" Javacheff told reporters with a smile.""When you realise that this is really alive, for me and for my team, when you realise this fragility, this beauty, it is quite amazing.""Not everyone has welcomed the project.Architect Carlo Ratti, a friend of Christo, wrote last week that it was wrong to waste so much fabric at a time when the fashion industry was responsible for such high levels of carbon emissions.Javacheff countered that the entire fabric is recyclable, along with half the metal used for scaffolding.Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot called it ""a posthumous testament to an artistic genius"" and ""a wonderful gift to Parisians, to the French, and to all art-lovers.""For Christo, who left sketches and photo montages of his plans, the vision was that the Arc would become ""like a living object stimulated by the wind and reflecting the light"".The monument was built by Napoleon to commemorate fallen soldiers during his military campaigns.It was recently restored after being defaced by anti-government ""yellow vest"" protesters in December 2018.Born in 1935, Christo left his home country in 1957, living in several countries before arriving in Paris, where he met his future wife Jeanne-Claude.He died of natural causes at his home in New York in May last year. - AFP"

In 2009, there were 13 people on the International Space Station (ISS).There are currently seven people aboard the ISS, including two Russian cosmonauts, and three Chinese astronauts on spaceship Shenzhou-12, which is bound home after its crew spent 90 days at the Tiangong space station.Isaacman, physician assistant Hayley Arceneaux, geoscientist Sian Proctor and aerospace data engineer Chris Sembroski are whizzing around the planet at an altitude that at times reaches 590 kilometers (367 miles).That is deeper in space than the ISS, which orbits at 420 kilometers (260 miles), and the furthest any humans have ventured since a 2009 maintenance mission for the Hubble telescope.Their ship is moving at about 17,500mph (28,000kmph) and each day they will experience about 15 sunrises and sunsets.Their high speed means they are experiencing time slightly slower than people on the surface, because of a phenomenon called “relative velocity time dilation”.Apart from fundraising for charity, the mission aims to study the biological effects of deep space on the astronauts’ bodies.“Missions like Inspiration4 help advance spaceflight to enable ultimately anyone to go to orbit & beyond,” added Musk in a tweet.The space adventure bookends a summer marked by the battle of the billionaires Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos to reach the final frontier.But these flights only offered a few minutes of weightlessness – rather than the three full days of orbit the Inspiration4 crew will experience, before splashing down off the coast of Florida on Saturday. – AFP"

Mercedes compounded that situation as they faltered with their own stop on Hamilton's car, which meant both drivers were neck and neck.""He did not give a further explanation but the FIA directive, which came into effect in August, aimed to slow pitstops for safety reasons by preventing the use of any automated systems.Red Bull had complained in June that the directive was aimed at reducing their advantage.The team hold the record for the quickest F1 pitstop at 1.82 seconds and had regularly managed to change all four tyres in less than two seconds.Red Bull's smart wheelguns previously automatically relayed a signal to the mechanic on the front jack as soon as all four wheels were on and tightened, according to the website http://www.the-race.comIt said mechanics pressed a button, even before starting to tighten the wheels, but now had to wait until the change was finished. If the button is pressed prematurely, no signal is sent and the procedure has to be repeated.The collision meant Verstappen left Monza with a five point lead over Hamilton, gaining two points from Saturday's experimental sprint qualifying.Horner said he still felt both drivers were to blame for the incident and ""if the FIA wanted to make a statement, they could’ve imposed the same penalty on both.""He said Verstappen's penalty would not be such a great handicap for Sochi, however, because of the aerodynamic 'tow' cars can collect on the long run to the first corner.(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis)"
"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",11:50 PM MYT,Asean+,,"Vietnam joins China, Cambodia, Singapore and S. Korea in pledging joint efforts on anti-pandemic cooperation, multilateralism","HONG KONG, Sept 17 (Xinhua):Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday that his recent four-nation tour to Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore and South Korea had upgraded mutually-beneficial cooperation among all sides and reached wide consensus on anti-pandemic cooperation, economic recovery, and multilateralism.Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore and South Korea are friendly neighbours and important partners of China, with deep pragmatic cooperation, broad common interests, and same or similar positions on various regional and international issues, Wang said.During his visit, China and the above-mentioned four countries have agreed to respect each other's development paths, understand and support each other on respective issues of core interests, Wang said.China reiterated its firm stance of upholding a friendly policy with the four countries, while the four nations reasserted their stand of putting their bilateral relations with China at a top or priority position, he said, adding that the Vietnamese side stressed that nobody can shake and change the unity and cooperation between Vietnam and China, Cambodia said it would speed up the construction of Cambodia-China community of a shared destiny, Singapore expressed willingness to create a new era of bilateral relationship with China, and South Korea intended to push the strategic cooperative partnership with China to a deeper level, Wang elaborated.China and the four countries agreed that the most urgent matter is to unify and combat the Covid-19 pandemic to contain and defeat the disease at an early date, so as to steadily promote economic recovery, he said.""The four nations are not only the extension of China's 'domestic circulation' but also the frontline of China's 'international circulation',"" said the Chinese foreign minister, adding that during the talks, all sides agreed to build a mutually-beneficial and win-win pattern, and jointly construct the ""Belt and Road"" with high quality.China and the four countries agreed to uphold multilateralism and safeguard the international system with the United Nations as its core, with all sides expressing willingness to focus on regional development so as to achieve common development, and resist unilateralism and power politics.Responding to China's cooperation with Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore and South Korea on fighting Covid-19, Wang said the five countries belong to a global community of health for all, and China has maintained strategic communication with the four countries, setting the direction for joint fight against the pandemic.Wang said the countries have helped each other in combatting the virus and the cooperation among them has achieved fruitful results.China has promised to continue to provide them with Covid-19 vaccines within its capacity, with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) countries as a priority, Wang added.As to the future ties between China and Asean, Wang said this year marks the 30th anniversary of the dialogue relations between the two sides, and their bilateral cooperation has set a paradigm for regional cooperation, become an important pillar for peace and stability in the region, and brought tangible benefits to 2 billion people in 11 countries.Wang said his visit was primarily aimed at elevating the China-Asean relations to a new phase.""We agreed that the 30th anniversary of the China-Asean dialogue relations should be turned into an opportunity to elevate their overall relationship and build a closer community of shared future between China and Asean,"" Wang noted.He went on to say that both sides should work together to explore new areas of cooperation in fighting the pandemic and seeking post-pandemic recovery, and get united to help turn East Asia into a model region of common development.Wang said China and Asean have agreed to cooperate in four areas. First, both sides will hold celebratory events to mark the 30th anniversary of the China-Asean dialogue relations.Second, they will jointly promote regional economic integration. China and Asean will work together to push for the entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) early next year and enhance connectivity.Third, both sides agreed to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea. China will coordinate closely with Asean nations to speed up their consultations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, and reach an agreement at an early date, which is effective, with practical significance, and in line with international law.Fourth, they will jointly safeguard international fairness and justice. Both sides should give full play to the ""in-the-same-boat"" spirit, discard the zero-sum mentality, uphold the UN-centered international system and promote multilateralism of win-win cooperation, so as to usher in a new era of common development.On the Korean Peninsula issue, Wang noted that new consensus has been reached between China and South Korea as the peninsular situation is at another crossroad.He said that the two sides agreed that further efforts should be made to maintain peace and stability on the peninsula, to continue resolving problems through dialogue, and to keep improving the relations between the South and the North on the peninsula.Wang dismissed the interpretation of China developing relations with countries in its neighborhood as competing with other major countries, saying that this is out of date Cold War thinking.He said that China and its neighboring countries are increasingly becoming important strategic partners and a community with shared future.China has always followed the principles of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in developing relations with neighboring countries on the basis of equality, Wang said, noting that China has never sought hegemony, expansionism nor sphere of influence.China has no intention of putting itself in rivalry or confrontation in Asia with any major countries, he said, adding that regional countries have also made it clear not to take sides.Wang said that the United States, as the world's largest developed country, and China, as the world's largest developing country, are both important cooperation partners for the regional countries.He said that both countries should keep the big picture in their minds, assume responsibilities of a major country, pushing their relations back onto the correct track of stable development, and developing coordination and cooperation in the region in a constructive manner in order to achieve mutual benefit and win-win results with regional countries. - Xinhua"

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",12:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,DAVIN ARUL,'Clickbait' review: Steers us through the haze of our lies on social media,"Clickbait? Hey, did someone trip (on some special fungi, perhaps) and make a miniseries about those intrusive and annoying online stories?You know, the kind with headlines like ""You won't believe what happens when Morgan opens the box"" or ""Former head of state shares miracle cure for (insert ailment here)"" or ""Check out how many hot dudes/dudettes live within 10km of you"" (yay, SOP-compliant hookups).Not yet. Things have not deteriorated that badly, thank goodness.No, wait. Actually, they have. And the over-before-you-realise-it thriller Clickbait from Netflix is here to cast light and throw shade on a range of social media-related ills that afflict our societal psyche.It does so by presenting, for our consideration, family man Nick Brewer (Adrian Grenier), a physical therapist in Oakland, California. Ha, fooled you, it's actually Melbourne, which is where most of this American-Australian venture was shot. Only to be expected of something named ""clickbait"".So Nick disappears one day and shows up online in a video that goes viral. Besides promising that he will die once it hits five million views, the video also hints that Nick is an abuser and murderer.It falls to his wife Sophie (Get Out's Betty Gabriel) and his sister Pia (a charismatic Zoe Kazan) – with some help from his boys Ethan (Camaron Engels) and Kai (Jaylin Fletcher) – to try and find him while clearing his name.Only it's not so easy, when women start popping up claiming that Nick had affairs with them while using different identities. Given that one of them is played by Jessie Collins, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation's notorious Miniature Killer, I'd keep a salt-shaker handy.Speaking of, Clickbait's showrunners cleverly shake up the show's (and by association, the audience's) perspective by having each episode told from the viewpoint of a different character: the sister, wife and kids, harassed detective Roshan Amiri (Phoenix Raei), unscrupulous reporter Ben Park (Abraham Lim)... and of course, the culprit(s) behind the various crimes being perpetrated here.You could indict everyone who actually chooses to view such a video, knowing that they could well be contributing to someone's murder.Or the media, who hound a family in pain and dig up every last nugget of dirt that can be truffle-pig-sniffed-out. (The miniseries is especially unflattering in its portrayal of journalists, as embodied by Park. Oi, we're not all like that.)There's another particularly nasty online behaviour or phenomenon that is on show here, but to mention it by name would drop too great a stinky spoiler. So, just follow along and you'll cotton on to it... oh, just about where creators Tony Ayres and Christian White want you to get it, I guess.It's terrifically acted, with the principal cast really inhabiting their roles, from the sons on up the age ladder.Gabriel, so great at showing the torment of someone trapped inside her own body in Get Out, extends that range now to give us a magnetic performance as a woman trapped in her life, partly through her own fault and then by the lies she keeps telling herself... as well as a dark truth that has been kept from her.And as the horrible ""truths"" begin to surface about Nick, we may find it hard attributing them to someone played so congenially by Grenier (who IMHO would have a great future in politics).Its core as a thriller aside, Clickbait also pricks the conscience a fair bit, since a lot of its characters' troubles are the all-too-familiar result of concealing the truth, looking the other way, blindly trusting the wrong people, and sometimes lying to ourselves with such intensity that those untruths become our reality.Amidst all the slices of humanity on show here, a few rays of light do shine through – altruistic individuals who rise above their flaws and are just, well, genuine about things.And then you wonder why they are so few in number.All eight episodes of Clickbait are available on Netflix."

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",1:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,,Spotting your child's learning disability early,"When it comes to learning, every child learns at a different pace.Any gaps in a child’s ability to learn usually show up once he or she starts going to kindergarten.One yardstick used to measure a child’s academic capability is known as 3M (menulis, membaca, mengira), which refers to the core skills of reading, writing and arithmetic.Over the past 18 months, some parents of young children who had to transition from kindergarten to primary school may have had worries because of the closure of kindergartens and pre-schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic.While this disruption may have affected the learning process, these challenges can be addressed, and by working together, parents and educators can assist a child to overcome any learning lag.That said, if you notice that your child is consistently struggling to learn or understand things, then it’s crucial to find the underlying root cause.Spot it earlyParents need to know if their child’s growth and development is progressing normally.This is only possible if you keep track of your child’s key developmental milestones starting from birth.Consultant paediatrician Datuk Dr Zulkifli Ismail explains: “Parents, especially first-time parents, should be familiar with important milestones, such as when an infant should start talking, recognising letters of the alphabet and so on.“This will help you quickly identify any significant delays or difficulties in learning how to read, talk or associate letters with sounds.”If you notice any significant delays, don’t ignore it or “wait and see”.Developmental delays (especially reading, language or social skills) are sometimes caused by problems with a child’s hearing or vision, so it’s best to spot these problems early on.Highlight any concerns with your child’s paediatrician to get professional help in confirming if this is the problem, or if it is indeed a learning disability.Dr Zulkifli, who is also chairman of the Positive Parenting programme, suggests: “If you’re not sure what to ask your paediatrician, just voice your concerns.“Be as specific as possible in describing your observations of your child’s development and behaviour, as these are very helpful clues.”Do note that while children with Down syndrome, autism spectrum disorder and brain trauma/injury often face problems with learning, these conditions are not considered a learning disability.There are specific types of learning disabilities, such as dyslexia (affects reading/writing), dyspraxia (affects motor skills) and dyscalculia (affects math ability).In 2015, a screening of Malaysian students by the Education Ministry estimated that 7% had dyslexia.He adds: “Parents must continue to remain vigilant.“Some learning disabilities such as dyslexia may only become apparent from kindergarten onwards.“Continue spending quality time with your child – not only will it be a boon to establishing a closer parent-child bond, but it also makes it easier for you to quickly identify any potential problems in her future development.”Learning differentlyA learning disability (also known as specific learning disability) is a significant and ongoing difficulty with one or more areas of learning.This can lead to greater learning difficulties, but in no way is it due to low intelligence.Intellectual disabilities are caused by impaired general IQ, which can lead to learning difficulties and is not limited to just academic performance, but can be seen across other areas of development as well.Signs of developmental delays include delays in early language, fine motor skills and independent self-care from an early age.Developmental and behavioural paediatrician Dr Cindy Chan points out: “A child with a specific learning disability often has a normal IQ – indeed, some are very bright intellectually.“Yet, without the right support, he will struggle to keep up with his peers.“This can affect his self-esteem and have a negative long-term impact on staying engaged with school or learning.”It is important to identify the underlying intellectual and learning profile of each child.Some children may have more than one type of learning disability, thus accurately identifying them will help in planning an effective education plan.However, it is far more crucial that your child receives extra support, compared to confirming the diagnosis of what he has.Coping with your child’s learning disability will often comprise several approaches.There is no one-size-fits-all approach to intervention, as it should be individualised and must allow for an intensity and length of time according to the child’s needs.Practical strategies include behavioural approaches (e.g. building in regular physical breaks during lessons), compensatory accommodations (e.g. use of voice-to-text apps for dyslexics or keyboard and laptop for students with significant handwriting difficulty) and environmental accommodations (e.g. preferential seating near the teacher’s desk or allowing a small fidget item for kids who have trouble focusing during lessons).Do talk with an expert to prepare specific interventions to help support and remedy your child’s issues, e.g. using systematic instructions to teach literacy.By providing early and effective support for a sufficient time, it can really help narrow the gaps in his school readiness, and promote crucial foundations in literacy and numeracy.Approach it systematically and take baby steps, while providing clear and systematic instructions on how he is to achieve them.Repeat as often as required and have regular revisions consistently.Communicate closely with your child’s teachers and paediatrician.At the same time, keep track of whether the methods are helping your child cope with his learning.This information will be useful to continuously fine-tune goals and strategies.The role of teachersThe school environment and educators also play a large role in helping children with learning disabilities stay on track academically.Parents need to actively work hand-in-hand with teachers, so don’t miss parent-teacher meetings and keep tabs on how your child is doing at school by communicating regularly with her teacher.Association of Registered Child-care Providers Malaysia (PPBM) president Anisa Ahmad says: “Children with learning disabilities should ideally be enrolled in an appropriate school, as attending a ‘normal’ school will not be conducive to their learning.“They may face problems such as being bullied or alienated by their peers, and teachers in a regular school may also lack the experience to handle kids with learning disabilities.“There are inclusive programmes for early childhood care and education in Taska (Taman Asuhan Kanak-kanak, or nursery) and Tadika (Taman Didikan Kanak-kanak, or kindergarten) where children will have empathy and recognition towards their special needs peers.”She adds: “Childcare providers and teachers need to learn early intervention programmes, so that early detection and stimulation can be done.“PPBM, together with the Health Ministry, are working together to create a module for this and we have already submitted a proposal to the Women, Family and Community Development Ministry to train childcare providers and teachers.”Sending a child to a private school specialising in teaching children with learning disabilities can be expensive.While there are public schools that cater to children with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, not all families may have access to such schools geographically.The 2019 National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) found that 4.7% of children in Malaysia (about 430,000) have disabilities, but only 74,694 have access to inclusive education in public schools.As a Taska advisor, Anisa adds: “It’s also been shown that parents and caregivers of children with learning disabilities face greater stress and negative caregiving consequences than those with typically-developing children.“Do consider joining parental support groups.“Facing hardship with the support of other parents who have encountered similar difficulties can make a big difference, even if it is just someone who can lend an ear to your troubles.”Love and supportRegardless of what your child’s learning disability may be, stay focused on nurturing his gifts and interests.Be supportive, and most importantly, provide him with unconditional love and support too!Provide positive feedback and approval based on positive behaviours.Any praise you give should always be honest, and most importantly, specific.Just a generic “good boy” loses any meaning after numerous repetitions.Also, when it comes to your expectations, be careful to match them with his aptitude and capabilities.As parenting can be demanding and stressful, be sure to take care of your own health and mental well-being.Take occasional breaks from your day-to-day routine to help you maintain the right state of mind, and to enable you to continue providing proper care for your child.Yes, life might be tougher, but with the right support and preparation, you can do it!At the end of the day, the most overwhelming key to a child’s success is the positive involvement of parents.This article is courtesy

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",1:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,SHEILA SINGAM,Proud to be Malaysian,"I am Malaysian. I have never identified myself as anything else. Whenever I have travelled to other countries and been asked, “What are you?”, I’ve replied, “I am Malaysian.”“Ah, you’re Malay!” cry some of the ignorant ones who do not know much about my country.Well, not quite, I reply. We’re actually a country made up of a mosaic of beautiful ethnicities that are characterised by different cultures, traditions, beliefs, cuisines, languages and much more. I belong to two of those beautiful ethnicities, two that originated from the Indian sub-continent – people who, more than two centuries ago, decided to sail forth to a golden peninsula, lured by the rhetoric of the British colonial masters who promised them a better life.There’s something about leaving the familiarity of everything you know to seek your fortune in a strange new land. It requires a strong, adventurous spirit and great intrepidity. Every immigrant who has been able to do that, whether out of a sense of adventure or a dire need, must be respected for that spirit inherent within him or her.As such, I am proud that I carry the genes of people who had the courage to migrate across the seas from South India and Sri Lanka to establish themselves in a new place that was not even a proper country to begin with. They settled here in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, at a time when Malaysia did not exist.When my forefathers arrived in the Malay peninsula, it was still just a collection of states over which the British had secured their hegemony. In 1896, the wily Brits had unified the four “protected” states of Selangor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang under the banner of the Federated Malay States. It’s a moot point whether these states, ruled by their Sultans, actually needed any protection at all. It was probably just a way for the colonisers to subjugate the states and assert their dominion over them, as they did everywhere they went.It was only in 1946, after the Second World War, that the Malayan Union was formed, amalgamating the Federated Malay States with two of the then Straits Settlements of Malacca and Penang, and with the Unfederated Malay States of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis, and Terengganu. Britain’s decision to form the Malayan Union was part of her plan for post-war reorganisation of the peninsula to improve administrative efficiency and security, especially in the face of the increasing threat from the Communist Party of Malaya.Two years later, the Union morphed into the Federation of Malaya, which achieved independence in 1957. Malaysia as we know it today was only formed in 1963 with the inclusion of Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore. This country was thus born long after my forefathers had settled down, procreated, contributed and integrated into the fabric of society in the Golden Peninsula.The words of American president Lyndon B Johnson resonate with me when I think of the mosaic of people like my forefathers, who came to Malaya long before it evolved into the Malaysia of today. “The land flourished because it was fed from so many sources – because it was nourished by so many cultures and traditions and peoples,” he said.The 2020 World Migration Report (WMR) states that in many countries, immigrants tend to have higher entrepreneurial activity compared to natives. Just saying.Malaysia is what she is today because of the myriad cultures that have contributed towards building her into what she is. I’m not just referring to the largest ethnic groups, meaning the Malays, Indians, Chinese, or the various indigenous communities in West and East Malaysia. Malaysia is what she is today because she has been built on the backs of people from various ethnic groups across South Asia – the Indonesians, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Pakistanis, Vietnamese, Myanmar nationals and others in the region who have opted to come to our shores to make a living. Let us never forget this.Mexican-American journalist Jorge Ramos said, “The greatest nations are defined by how they treat their weakest inhabitants.”Who are our weakest inhabitants today? Minority groups being side-lined or scorned because the brave migratory decisions of their forefathers brought them to these shores? Migrant factory workers deprived of their human rights by treacherous employers? Domestic workers abused by their employers on a daily basis? Undocumented foreigners who are forced to go into hiding because of fear of how they will be treated if apprehended?How are we treating those who live on these shores today? How are we treating generations of people who have helped build this country into what it is today?Sheila SingamWe are all citizens of the world. It is the leaders of the past who have carved out boundaries on maps and separated us into this or that nation. Migration has been a habit of the human race since the dawn of mankind. The WMR says that “mobility is an inherent characteristic of all populations unless specific policies or other factors are in place that limit or control that mobility.”None of us can claim to be genetically pure, belonging to just one race. Every one of us has within us the genetic codes of various sub-ethnic groups due to the migratory and conjugal patterns of our ancestors centuries ago. To claim otherwise would make us Hitlerian in our outlook and we certainly don’t want to go there!Whatever my genetic code or anyone may say, I see myself as truly Malaysian, no matter where my forefathers came from. I am a fourth-generation Malaysian, born after the cry of Merdeka resonated across this land. My love for this country is as deep as can be.I’ve lived through the riots of May 13, 1969; numerous economic recessions; the rise of racism; a pandemic and changes in government. I’ve listened to the bombastic speechifying of politicians on both sides of the divide, I’ve been sickened by the dastardly acts of scheming leaders and I’ve been devastated at the increasing impact of a pandemic gone out of control, and yet, my love for my country remains unchanging.In recent times, this country has been featured in the news globally for many wrong reasons. She has been vilified, laughed at, turned into a meme and disrespected, simply because of the indiscriminate actions of some of her misguided sons and daughters.And yet, there are millions of Malaysians of various ethnic origins who love her enough to want her dignity restored and for her to be elevated to her former glory. I remember that former glory. I remember a land that was highly respected for the values it was built upon and operated on, a land where the varied mosaic of ethnicities was lauded as being the very thing that made us unique.I recollect a time when my friends and I never looked at ourselves as people of different races, even as we revelled in tasting the different cuisines our mothers prepared for festive occasions. Those were the times we freely held open houses and served home-cooked food and no one questioned our decision to partake of it.I recollect also a time when the realities of a multi-racial society were openly portrayed in timeless movies made by the likes of the late P. Ramlee and his ilk and where the Rukun Negara held centrestage at every school assembly to remind us of the values we should hold dear. I often reminisce, too, about how the Negaraku was played at official functions and even in cinemas across the land, and I lament the fact that some of our young Malaysians do not even know the lyrics of their national anthem.Call me a romantic, call me an idealist, but I want my country as I knew it back. I want to see integrity held as a virtue above all else, and not ridiculed as being a citadel of the naïve.I want to see equality and meritocracy in all segments of society and the economy. I want to see justice prevail at all levels, and all who reside on these shores – citizens and migrant workers alike – treated with respect and dignity.I want to see words like “pendatang” eradicated for all time from our vocabulary and authentic leaders who will put the interests of this country first and who will steer its course with love and dedication to her glory.“Rakyat hidupBersatu dan majuRahmat bahagiaTuhan kurniakan.”This is my Merdeka wish and I urge all Malaysians, whatever your faith, to join me in offering this wish up as a prayer for our nation today.Sheila Singam is the founder of Human Equation, a development consultancy specialising in mindset change and innovation.

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",1:05 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,"Haters, supporters weigh in on Meghan and Harry's ‘strange’, ‘plasticky’ Time cover photo","Prince Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are back in the headlines yet again, this time after being honored this week as one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2021.The honour comes with a glowing writeup by their friend, World Central Kitchen chef and founder Jose Andres, who said that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex “turn compassion into boots on the ground through their Archewell Foundation” and “give voice to the voiceless through media production”.In addition to Andrés’ essay, the honor comes with a Time magazine cover. However, the cover photo of the British prince and his former TV actress wife is leaving some people scratching their heads.Certainly, the Sussexes’ die-hard social media fans love the photo and are praising them for looking “gorgeous”, “iconic” and inspirational to so many around the world. “I love his beard,” exclaimed one person. “I love her nails. Her Hair! Perfect.”But others replying to Time’s tweet of the cover image say that the photo looks “off”, “stiff” or “fake.” They say their pose seems “unnatural” and note that the photo appears heavily edited so as to remove any flaws or lines. Some even wonder if separate images images of the two were edited together.“What a strange photo ... it’s made to look like Harry is the same height as Meghan ... is he bending over?” remarked one person in the start of one thread.When someone claimed the “beautiful photo” was arranged so that the “effortlessly cool” duo would appear to be of the same height and therefore of equal status, another person replied: “The only effort in this pic is the person who’s photoshopped 2 different pictures together.”Someone else said, “Looks a bit too ‘plasticky’? The photoshop is rich on this one.”And yet another critic remarked, “The cover looks so fake... oh wait it’s because they are,” while someone else addressed the editing: “Looks like a really bad case of photoshop.”In the hundreds of replies, people also argued back and forth over whether the Sussexes truly are compassionate people who are doing good in the world.Harry and and his American wife gave up being full-time senior royals in 2020 and moved to the United States, settling into a US$14mil mansion in Montecito. In their blockbuster interview with Oprah Winfrey, the Sussexes talked about the need for privacy and to escape the mentally harmful environment of royal life, which included constant criticism from the UK tabloid media.Since arriving in the US, the Sussexes have launched their own charitable foundation and signed multi-million dollar deals with Netflix and Spotify to produce positive, uplifting podcasts, documentaries and children’s series.But the Sussexes have become divisive figures, especially in Harry’s native Britain. Critics accuse them of trading in on their connections to Queen Elizabeth II and a promise to continue the flow of royal gossip. In their Oprah Winfrey interview, they made a number of damaging allegations against the royal family, including that one family member said racist things about their son before he was born.But Harry and Meghan’s defenders are praising their Time honour: “Amazing cover!” wrote one person. “Love all the good work they are doing despite the vicious attacks coming at them by The Firm. Keep up the good work #HarryAndMeghan! Your humanitarian work speaks for itself.""“Beautiful words by Jose Andres,” said another. “They are truly iconic. It’s time their haters stop lying to themselves about it.”In his Time essay, Andres also wrote: “In a world where everyone has an opinion about people they don’t know, the duke and duchess have compassion for the people they don’t know. They don’t just opine. They run toward the struggle.”But a number questioned whether Harry and Meghan are truly compassionate, given the dirty laundry they’ve aired about his family, especially just before the death in April of his 99-year-old grandfather, Prince Philip.“How can they have compassion for those they don’t know, when they have no compassion for those who they do know, like their own family,” asked one person.Others laughed off their claims of wanting privacy. “I have compassion for them,” one wrote. “I feel so bad that people who begged for privacy end up on the front cover of Time.” – The Mercury News/Tribune News Service"
"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",1:40 PM MYT,Tech,KENNY CHEE,"Hackers pose as S’pore bank customers by stealing OTPs, making S$500K in fake credit card payments","SINGAPORE: Hackers abroad have been able to pose as 75 bank customers here to make about S$500,000 (RM1.54mil) in fake credit card payments.This was done by a sophisticated method of hijacking the one-time passwords (OTPs) sent through SMS text messages by banks.The hackers had diverted the SMS OTPs from the banks to overseas mobile network systems, explained the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and Singapore Police Force in a joint statement on Wednesday (Sept 15).They said the SMS diversion method “requires highly sophisticated expertise to compromise the systems of overseas telecommunication networks”.The fraudulent transactions happened between September and December last year.The bank customers said they did not initiate the transactions and did not receive the SMS OTPs needed to complete the transactions.The authorities gave an assurance that Singapore's banking and telecommunication systems were not compromised.Affected customers who had taken steps to protect their credentials will not have to pay for any of the fake transactions as a gesture of goodwill by the banks, “given the unique circumstances of these cases”, said the authorities. The identities of the banks involved were not revealed.So far, UOB has said that it has “proactively reviewed” the cases involving its affected customers and will work with each of them on a case-by-case basis to offer the payment waiver.It is understood that customers of DBS and OCBC, as well as some foreign banks, were affected too. The banks would have informed affected customers.The method used by the cyber criminals in this incident involved their getting hold of the victims’ credit card details and mobile phone numbers.They also hacked into the systems of overseas telcos and used them to change the location information of the mobile phones used by the Singapore victims.By doing so, the hackers tricked Singapore telco networks into thinking that the Singapore numbers were roaming overseas on the networks of other countries.The hackers then used the victims’ stolen credit card details to make fraudulent online card payments.So when the banks sent out SMS OTPs to the victims to verify the transactions, the crooks were able to divert these text messages to the overseas mobile network systems.The stolen OTPs were then used to complete the fraudulent card payments. This matches with the victims saying they did not get the OTPs.The compromised overseas telecommunication networks have been identified and notified, but the agencies did not reveal who they were or where they were from.Investigations are ongoing to identify the criminals and bring them to justice. It is also unclear where the hackers are from.Eric Nagel, general manager for the Asia-Pacific at cybersecurity firm Cybereason, said SMS OTPs rely on third-party technology on an operating system that is not immune to sophisticated attacks.One such technology that can be hacked is that used for text-messaging management services.Such services can be hired by businesses for US$16 (RM66) in the United States to redirect SMSes, business news outlet Business Today reported. So besides hacking them, cyber criminals can also hire these services.Nagel added that the discovery of the SMS OTP diversion here is not surprising.Earlier this year, Cybereason found that three Chinese threat groups, which recently attacked telcos in Asean, had previously carried out cyberattacks in other countries like the United States and the United Kingdom.But Nagel said that banks and telcos are trying to reduce reliance on third-party vendors.“This should diminish these types of attacks over time, as they take back control (of systems),” he said.While Singapore’s telco networks were not compromised, IMDA has told them to put in place additional safeguards. They include specialised firewalls and system safeguards to monitor and block suspicious SMS diversions.IMDA had earlier consulted the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) on the additional telco measures.When contacted, CSA said it has assessed that the controls in place are adequate to address the hackers’ current methods.“Cyber criminals are constantly developing new and sophisticated methods and tools to target their victims,” said the agency. “Organisations and individuals must continue to stay vigilant and take steps to keep their assets and information secure.”The authorities’ statement comes after the Singapore government said in July that a review would be done by the end of the year to provide clearer guidelines on what happens to consumers and banks in the event of scams.MAS will be working with financial institutions to fine-tune the existing framework on fraudulent payment transactions, covering the responsibilities and liabilities of banks and consumers in such situations.At the time, it was reported the police had received 89 reports of fraudulent card transactions performed with SMS OTPs, where the victims said they did not make the transaction or receive the OTP to authorise it, between September last year and February this year.The amount stolen in these cases was S$550,500 (RM1.70mil).Finance Minister Lawrence Wong, who is MAS’ deputy chairman, said in Parliament that while these cases represented less than 0.1% of fraudulent online card transactions reported, and the number of cases has come down since March 2021, “it is nevertheless concerning”.IMDA, MAS and the police urged the public to be alert and vigilant against malware and phishing attempts that seek to steal their personal details, since the incident involved stolen credit card information.For instance, consumers should keep their bank account, credit and debit card details safe at all times. They should never disclose to anyone these details, as well as their personal identification numbers, passwords and codes like OTPs.They can also set low thresholds for payment transaction alerts, which can allow unauthorised activities to be detected early. Consumers should alert their banks as soon as possible if there are any discrepancies or unauthorised transactions.They should keep their devices updated with the latest security patches and anti-virus software.Consumers should use only credible online services, download apps from official app stores, and make online purchases through trustworthy platforms.Members of the public should also never click on suspicious links from unknown sources. – The Straits Times (Singapore)/Asia News Network"
"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",1:42 PM MYT,Business,,Top Glove 4Q net profit slips but full year at RM7.87b,"KUALA LUMPUR: Top Glove Corporation Bhd posted a historic net profit of RM7.87bil for the financial year ended Aug 31, 2021 but its fourth quarter earnings fell to RM607.94m amid the very challenging operating environment.The world’s largest glove maker announced on Friday, FY21 net profit jumped 350% from RM1.75bil in FY20. Sales Revenue rose 127% to RM16.40bil from FY2020.Meanwhile, the group’s net cash position as at Aug 31, 2021 remained healthy at RM2.05bil.However, 4Q net profit fell to RM607.94mil from RM1.17bil a year ago. Sales fell by 32% to RM2.12bil from RM3.11bil.Elaborating on the results, Top Glove said the group’s commendable yearly financial performance was attributed to strong glove demand coupled with elevated average selling prices (ASPs) driven by the ongoing pandemic.“Meanwhile, its 4QFY2021 results were softer on the back of normalising demand, following mass vaccine rollout on a global scale, leading to lower sales Volume and ASPs, which were not matched by a corresponding reduction in raw material prices.“This was further affected by the finding imposed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), impacting sales volume and profit.“Performance was also affected by the Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO) during which the glove industry in the state of Selangor was not allowed to operate for 10 days, which involved 50% of Top Glove’s factories; as well as a subsequent round of the Movement Control Order during which the affected facilities were only permitted to operate at 60%. The reduced output adversely impacted utilisation, driving costs upward,” it said.Top Glove declared the total dividend payout for 4QFY2021 is 71%, comprising a special dividend payout of 21% plus 50% in line with the company’s dividend policy.This amounts to a total dividend of 5.4 sen per share, comprising a final dividend of 3.8 sen per share and a special dividend of 1.6 sen per share. The ex-date for the dividend is Oct 1, 2021, while the payment date is Oct 15, 2021.The total dividend declared for FY2021 amounts to approximately RM5.21 billion or 65.1 sen per share, which represents a 452% increase from the full year dividend for FY2020 of 11.8 sen per share.Top Glove managing director Datuk Lee Kim Meow said, “We are pleased to deliver such strong results in spite of several challenges throughout the year. We attribute this to our committed and capable employees, who have partnered with us to weather the tough times and worked tirelessly with a sharpened focus on adhering to SOPs, to ensure we met the urgent need for gloves globally, particularly for frontliners.”Our good performance has allowed us to continue delivering value to our many stakeholders. We are able to reward our loyal shareholders and investors for their continued support. It also positions us to continue creating gainful employment and fulfilling our tax obligations, while supporting worthy causes as well as communities. In addition, it enables us to create reserves to insulate our business and ensure we remain fit and future ready,” he said.Lee said notwithstanding the accelerating vaccination rate, which has sped up the moderating glove demand and tapering of ASPs, Top Glove remains upbeat about industry prospects.“We are confident that demand for gloves as an essential item in the healthcare sector will continue its upward trend, all the more with the emergence of new virus strains,” he said.“While the business environment ahead is expected to be challenging and competitive, we believe Top Glove is well positioned to overcome, just as we have in the past,” he added."
"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",2:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,MUMTAJ BEGUM,Model Jung Ho-yeon goes from NY Fashion Week to making her acting debut in new K-drama ‘Squid Game’,"Director Hwang Dong-hyuk admitted he auditioned a lot of actresses for the role of Sae-byeok for his new Netflix series Squid Game, but no one felt right.That is until he received an audition tape from top Korean model Jung Ho-yeon, which the latter recorded in New York where she was walking the runway for the New York Fashion Week.“When I saw the self-tape from Jung, I knew straightaway that she was the perfect fit for Sae-byeok,” said Hwang during a virtual press conference in South Korea that StarLifestyle was invited to.“I felt it right away – the tone of her voice, the glare and the aura, everything was perfect.”So convinced was the director of Jung as Sae-byeok, that he wanted to meet her in person right away to confirm that his impression was accurate.Fortunately for Hwang, Jung was equally keen to play the role of a jaded North Korean defector in Squid Game, that the 27-year-old took the next flight out to South Korea from New York to meet Hwang.The busy model also cleared her schedule so she could concentrate on Squid Game.“I really wanted to be part of this series, so I put a lot of thought and energy into practising (Sae-byeok) lines for the audition tape,” shared Jung, who is making her acting debut with the series.She revealed further: ""When I started reading the script, it was late at night. And I read it until the morning, in one sitting. I stayed up all night reading it; that's how great the story is.""After getting the job, Jung completely immersed herself in the role of Sae-byeok – a woman who’s had more than her fair share of problems and tough days.Part of that preparation was taking lessons to master the North Korean dialect, in which Sae-byeok speaks in with certain people.Jung explained of her character: “Sae-byeok pickpockets to make a living. But she needs a lot of money if she wants to be with her family. And, that is how she ends up taking part in the game.""Squid Game centres on 456 cash-strapped men and women who are recruited to participate in a deadly survival game.If they make it through six rounds of games, the winners will get to keep the prize money amounting to 45.6 billion won (RM162mil). If they lose, they are eliminated... literally.Directed by Hwang from a story he wrote in 2008-2009, Squid Game also stars Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae-soo, Oh Young-soo, Wi Ha-jun and Heo Seong-taeThe nine-episode series starts streaming on Netflix on Sept 17, at 3pm."

The lessors are presently in the process of reviewing them,"" AAX said.The airline told the court it has received signed letters of undertaking from three large creditors to support and vote for the scheme, namely Honeywell International, Bridgestone Aircraft Tire Company and Sky High I Leasing Company.AAX proposed last October to restructure RM64.15bil of debt, drawing objections from more than a dozen creditors, many of them lessors.Airbus, the airline's biggest creditor, filed an affidavit in December saying it stands to lose more than US$5 billion worth of orders if the scheme goes through. It declined to comment on the restructuring process.This week, the court granted AAX an extension to hold its creditors meetings by March next year, when a restraining order preventing creditors from filing fresh lawsuits against the airline expires.Shukor Yusof, head of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said AAX's low-cost, long-haul model was no longer sustainable due to the pandemic.""Creditors, including lessors and Airbus, understandably don't want to see the airline fall as they stand to lose a lot.

We reserve the right to edit all submissions. Email: lifestyle@thestar.com.my with the subject 'My Pet Story'.We saw it sitting on top of a road hump outside our front porch, occasionally darting in and out of traffic.We were so worried about him being run over.Without hesitation, I quietly went over to try to catch it.Although it was only a kitten, it was very alert, and feisty too.Immediately, it ran helter-skelter but I was determined to rescue him, no matter what.So the chase began.We ran for at least 100m. It was good exercise for me indeed as I cannot remember when I last ran so fast.At last, it got tired and hid under some bushes. That’s when I grabbed him.It put up a good fight, biting and scratching hard, but I was determined to not let go so I endured it.On reaching home, I put it down in a basket to keep him from escaping.To calm it down, I gave him whatever I thought a kitten could eat – and it ate hungrily. Poor little kitten.Since we weren’t sure of its gender back then, we named it Kiki, as Kiki is a somewhat neutral name.Since it was still MCO 3.0 then, my nephew went online to buy it a cage, some cat food and other stuff.Looking after it gave us a sense of purpose during the lockdown. It added some excitement and entertainment to our lives too.As soon as the lockdown was eased, we made an appointment for it to see the vet for a quick checkup.It was then that we found out it was a he. Luckily, it didn’t have any major medical issues, just some ticks, but still the vet gave it an injection.Initially, it wasn’t allowed indoors as it liked to romp about in our small garden and get covered with soil.Later, my nephew bought a bottle of cat shampoo and a cat bath bag to wash him. Now it can come indoors after its baths.As we saw Kiki grow, we also saw its cuteness and some kitty temperaments which were entertaining and somewhat humorous to us.Occasionally, it is naughty but he listens when taught to behave. But it will vent his anger by scratching the mat we bought for it.Kiki will only do sneak attacks on me (as I let it), by hiding and then pouncing on me at every opportunity it got.Initially, the bites were just nibbles but as it got stronger, they actually hurt!Occasionally, we feed Kiki some human food, like bits of cake etc, and it enjoys them.Now that Kiki can come indoors, it frequents the kitchen when food is being prepared or cooked, especially if fish is on the menu, which is his favourite.Kiki had the second vaccination two weeks ago. Each time after its vaccination, it would sleep for hours and feel lethargic too, somewhat like us after our Covid-19 jabs.In the mornings, Kiki waits in its cage for me to feed it its regular kitten food before it wanders off into the garden.Kiki loves to watch my wife do the gardening and would just sit quietly next to her while she tends to her plants.During the afternoons, after food, Kiki will have its nap. We have installed a baby fan in its cage to keep it cool.In the evenings, after feeding Kiki, we will play with it so that it gets some exercise.Kiki loves evening walks. My nephew got it a cat bag with a transparent cover to carry it in when going for walks. When we put the bag down, Kiki just strolls into it and sits there waiting.Sometimes, we also take it for car rides when we go shopping for our groceries.At night, Kiki goes into its cage and waits for my wife to come around and feed it and to say good night and pat it before it sleeps. It’s a routine which Kiki loves.Kiki is adventurous – it likes to explore new places so, at times, he will climb over the fence to seek out my neighbour’s compound but it has yet to learn how to climb down the fence to come back.Kiki may be naughty and disobedient at times but it is a bundle of joy for us and keeps us happy in these difficult times."

Maintain overweight,” it said.UOB Kay Hian Research said with the nation’s vaccination rate expected to reach more than 80% for adults, NFOs were allowed to reopen for business from Sept 13, subject to having acceptable standard operating procedures (SOP) in place to ensure proper social distancing.It also pointed out that as originally expected, the resumption of NFO businesses precedes the casino subsector - Genting Malaysia’s (GENM) casinos are still awaiting the authorities’ nod to resume operations, but “we expect the reopening to be imminent”.The research house said the worst might be over for the NFOs as the nation progresses towards full and uninterrupted economy reopening. With the nation’s vaccination programme having reached an important threshold, the government has made clear its intention to restore a semblance of normalcy even without eradicating the virus, and we no longer expect strict lockdowns to be re-imposed.The potential border relaxation and further lifting of Covid-19 restrictions will reinforce the NFOs’ expected recovery, led by both local patronage and foreign workers.“Hence, we expect to see a steep earnings recovery from 4Q21 onwards,” he said.It also pointed out while the NFO business model is defensive in nature, NFOs could benefit from pent-up demand of its relatively inelastic consumer base.Magnum and Berjaya Sports Toto might potentially benefit from the “revenge spending”. Meanwhile, authorities’ effort to curb illegal operators will also be accelerated as the police forces step back from roadblock duties as the economy reopens.“Maintain overweight on the gaming sector and NFO subsector. Investors will soon focus on the sector’s sustainable prospective dividends yields of more than 6.6%.“We prefer Magnum for its pure exposure to the segment with a longer-term potential catalyst of U-Mobile monetisation.“Maintain Buy on Berjaya Sports Toto and Magnum. We have upgraded Magnum’s target price to RM2.45 after adjusting for higher draw days for FY21.""Our target price for Magnum implies 14x FY21F PE (historical mean: 14-15x PE) after inputting U-Mobile’s option value.

China is the world’s biggest EV market and of critical importance to Tesla, particularly after a rocky few months that dented its reputation in the country.“I have a great deal of respect for the many Chinese automakers” for driving EV technologies, Musk said during a spiel that barely lasted three minutes. He noted that the country’s carmakers are particularly strong on software. “Public sentiment and support for electric vehicles is at a never before seen inflection point because they know it is the future,” he said.After initially enjoying a red-carpet welcome in the country – including being the only foreign automaker allowed to wholly own its local operations and receiving support for its factory near Shanghai – Tesla has endured a series of setbacks this year. A protest by a disgruntled owner at the Shanghai auto show in April went viral on social media and was followed by a spate of crashes and regulatory scrutiny of safety, data and customer service issues.Tesla is also facing fiercer competition in China from local EV startups including Xpeng Inc, Li Auto Inc and Nio Inc.The California-based company’s shipments of China-made cars to local buyers rebounded last month, and exports from the company’s Shanghai factory – mostly to Europe – jumped. That saw Tesla’s overall China shipments in August rise 34% from July to 44,264 vehicles.Tesla last month temporarily halted some operations at its Shanghai factory as the global shortage of semiconductors hit the electric carmaker, Bloomberg News reported. Part of a production line at the China plant was halted for about four days in August because of a lack of key chips.Musk also spoke about data security during his appearance Friday, saying it is the cornerstone of the industry as it develops.“Tesla will work with national authorities in all countries to ensure data security of intelligence and connected vehicles,” he said. “With the rapid growth of autonomous driving technologies, data security of vehicles is drawing more public concern than ever before.”Earlier this year, Beijing requested that Tesla store all data gathered by its cars locally, after the vehicles were banned from entering military compounds and some government areas on concerns their cameras could be used for spying.The EV pioneer soon pledged to abide by the request and set up datacentres in the nation. Tesla last month posted job ads for positions including a data privacy lawyer, and for external relations managers earlier this week.Wang Jun, the chief operating officer of Huawei Technologies Co’s intelligent automotive solutions division, spoke after Musk Friday, reiterating that the networks giant doesn’t plan to make its own cars.

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",4:00 PM MYT,Tech,SHRUTI SRIVASTAVA,"Amazon, Microsoft swoop in on US$24bil India farm-data trove","Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. are among technology giants lining up to harness data from India’s farmers in an ambitious government-led productivity drive aimed at transforming an outmoded agricultural industry.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration, which is seeking to ensure food security in the world’s second-most populous nation, has signed preliminary agreements with the three US titans and a slew of local businesses starting April to share farm statistics it’s been gathering since coming to power in 2014. Modi is betting the private sector can help farmers boost yields with apps and tools built from information such as crop output, soil quality and land holdings.Jio Platforms Ltd., the venture controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd., and tobacco giant ITC Ltd. are among local powerhouses that have signed up for the program, the government said this week.With the project, Modi is seeking to usher in long-due reforms to make over a farm sector that employs almost half of the nation’s 1.3 billion people and contributes about a fifth of Asia’s third-biggest economy.The government is counting on the project’s success to boost rural incomes, cut imports, reduce some of the world’s worst food wastages with better infrastructure, and eventually compete with exporters such as Brazil, the US and the European Union.For global firms, it’s a stab at India’s agritech industry, which Ernst & Young estimates to have the potential to reach about US$24bil (RM100.14bil) in revenue by 2025, with the current penetration being only 1%.It’s also a chance to deploy networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning in a developing country, while for e-commerce firms such as Amazon and Reliance, securing a steady stream of farm produce could help crack a groceries market that accounts for more than half of the US$1tril (RM4.17tril) in annual retail spending by Indians.""This is a high impact industry and private players are sensing the opportunity and want to be a large part of it,” said Ankur Pahwa, a partner at consultancy EY India. ""India has a very high amount of food wastage because of lack of technology and infrastructure. So there’s a huge upside to the programme.”The idea is simple: Seed all the information such as crop pattern, soil health, insurance, credit, and weather patterns into a single database and then analyse it through AI and data analytics. Then the goal is to develop personalised services for a sector replete with challenges such as peaking yields, water stress, degrading soil and lack of infrastructure including temperature-controlled warehouses and refrigerated trucks.Under the agreement, the big tech companies help the government in developing proof of concepts to offer tech solutions for farm-to-fork services, which farmers will be able to access at their doorstep. If beneficial, firms would be able to sell the final product to the government and also directly to growers and the solutions would be scaled up at the national level.So far, the government has seeded publicly available data for more than 50 million farmers of the 120 million identified land-holding growers. Some of the local companies that have signed up include Star Agribazaar Technology, ESRI India Technologies, yoga guru Baba Ramdev’s Patanjali Organic Research Institute and Ninjacart.But success is far from guaranteed. The plan to rope in big corporations is already drawing fire from critics, who say the move is yet another attempt by the government to give the private sector a greater sway, a development that could hurt small and vulnerable farmers.The programme may even add fuel to the protracted protests Modi’s government has been struggling to tackle for more than nine months after controversial new agricultural laws riled up some farmers. With crucial state elections due in 2022, it may get tougher to sell the technology-to-help-agriculture plan to a farming community already suspicious of the government’s intentions.""With this data they will know where the produce wasn’t good, and will buy cheap from farmers there and sell it at exorbitant prices elsewhere,” said Sukhwinder Singh Sabhra, a farmer from the northern state of Punjab, who has been protesting since November against the new farm laws. ""More than the farmers it is the consumers who will suffer.”Technology adoption is still at a nascent stage in India, said Apeksha Kaushik, principal analyst at Gartner. ""Limited availability of technology infrastructure and recurring natural phenomena like floods, droughts have also worked against the deployment of digital solutions,” she said.Anxiety over data privacy could be another challenge. Abhimanyu Kohar, a 27-year-old farmers’ leader, who has been supporting the protesting farmers, said it’s a ""serious issue.” ""We all know the record of the government in keeping the data safe,” he said.Despite the hurdles, a few one-year pro bono pilot programs are already underway.Microsoft has selected 100 villages to deploy AI and machine learning and build a platform. Amazon, which has already started offering real-time advice and information to farmers through a mobile app, is offering cloud services to solution providers. Representatives at the India offices of Microsoft and Amazon didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.Star Agribazaar, whose co-founder Amit Mundawala calls the project a ""game changer,” will collect data on agri land profiling, crop estimation, soil degradation and weather patterns. ESRI India is using geographic information system to generate data and create applications, according to Managing Director Agendra Kumar.""Once you have the data, you can correlate with on-ground reality and improve your projections, take informed decisions and see which regions need policy intervention,” said P.K. Joshi, former director for South Asia at Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute.A similar data-driven system implemented in the southern state of Karnataka last year helped increase efficiency in delivery of government benefits, said Rajeev Chawla, the state’s additional chief secretary. Some bank loans have even been made to farmers using the centralised data, and all government programs, verification for insurance and loans and minimum support price are being routed through the mechanism, plugging leakages and eliminating frauds, he said.Besides the tech giants, many smaller companies and startups are likely to join the programme. When completed the project will form the core of a national digital agriculture ecosystem to help farmers realize better profitability with access to right information at the right time, and to facilitate better planning and execution of policies, according to the government’s consultation paper on digital agriculture.""How this exercise will translate into action or lead to higher production and farm income, that remains to be seen,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings Ltd. – Bloomberg"

I also strongly suggest not to lift the quarantine measures in the meantime,” he was quoted saying by The Nation daily.He added that it is premature for Thailand to reopen its door to foreign travelers on Oct 1 as the only 38 per cent of the country’s population received at least one dose of vaccine, while only 18 per cent completed two-doses vaccination.Meanwhile, Thailand plans to inoculate 4.35 million students aged between 12 and 18 years old before school reopens, tentatively in November.Education Permanent Secretary Supat Champathong said the inoculation is scheduled to start next month and the second jab will be administered three weeks later.""We hope the school will be reopen for the second semester in November this year,” he said.Amid COVID-19 outbreak in the kingdom, all schools in Thailand have been closed since the first semester of the 2021 academic year.Over the last 24 hours, Thailand recorded 13, 897 new COVID-19 cases and 188 deaths, bringing the total infections in the kingdom to 1,434, 237 and 14,953 fatalities. - Bernama"

He said China was determined to safeguard its sovereignty and maritime interests.The 4,000-tonne frigate Bayern set off from Wilhelmshaven last month for a six-month mission to the Indo-Pacific, including the disputed South China Sea, to strengthen Germany’s presence in the region.China has overlapping claims with several neighbours to the resource-rich South China Sea, through which about a third of global trade also passes.China denies request for German frigate to make port call in ShanghaiThe United States has frequently deployed its warships and planes to conduct “freedom of navigation” operations and naval exercises in the region to challenge China’s claims, and asked its allies to do the same.Before the Bayern’s departure last month, German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said its goal was to show allies in the region that “we are standing up for our values and interest together”.She also said she wanted the European Union to establish a “permanent presence” in the region.After the rejection of the port call request, the frigate’s route was updated to include a stop in the northern Australian city of Darwin.Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University, said that for nearly a year, the German government had been repeating remarks about coordinating with allies, establishing a strategic presence and safeguarding freedom of navigation, and this was probably the cause of Beijing’s anger.“According to these statements, Germany’s motives could be reasonably considered by the Chinese government to be harmful to China’s security interests and sovereign claims,” he said. “Under those circumstances, we could imagine that China would refuse the German warship permission to call at Chinese ports.”As cracks continue to grow, EU says it might reconsider China relationshipShi said that despite its immediate negative impact, the refusal of the port visit was unlikely to affect other aspects of the China-Germany relationship if Germany took no further steps that Beijing deemed harmful to China.Nils Schmid, foreign affairs spokesman for the Social Democratic Party – which is leading in the polls for the German election, to be held in less than two months – said that the frigate’s journey was “symbolically important” but he did not envisage Germany becoming very active militarily in the region.Additional reporting by Rachel ZhangMore from South China Morning Post:China denies request for German frigate to make port call in ShanghaiBeijing to Berlin: clarify warship’s intentions in South China Sea or forget Shanghai visitWhy China is not saying yes – or no – to the German navy’s port call requestChina, US cry crime and misdemeanour as warship tests Beijing’s new law at Mischief ReefFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021."

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",5:51 PM MYT,Asean+,FINBARR BERMINGHAM,"EU unveils Indo-Pacific strategy, and admits US’ new ‘Aukus’ alliance came as a surprise","The European Union announced details of its long-awaited Indo-Pacific strategy on Thursday, at an event that was completely overshadowed by a new US-backed security alliance aimed at countering China.The strategy calls for the EU to increase its naval presence in the region through port calls and freedom of navigation exercises in a bid to “promote an open and rules-based regional security architecture”.But at a press conference in Brussels, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell was instead peppered with questions about the “Aukus” security pact between the US, Britain and Australia announced on Wednesday, which sent shock waves through European capitals.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.The agreement saw Canberra cancel a US$90 billion deal with France to build a new submarine fleet, infuriating Paris.Borrell said he had no idea the plan was in the works, but moved to dampen talk that it put more pressure on an already strained relationship with Washington.“We’ve only just been made aware of it and weren’t even consulted. I certainly, as the high representative for security policy at the European Union, I was not aware. And I assume that an agreement of such a nature wasn’t just brought together overnight, I think it would have been worked on for quite a while,” Borrell said, suggesting that Aukus proved the “timeliness” of the EU’s own Indo-Pacific policy.Borrell “regretted” not being part of the arrangement, but said the effect on EU-US relations should not be “dramatised”. Nor would Australia’s seeming breach of a supply contract with France hamper negotiations over a trade deal with the EU, Borrell said.“We want to foster cooperation with countries such as Australia, we are not taking ad hoc action motivated by individual events such as the ones we may have heard today,” he said. “Trade agreements with Australia will continue down their path.”EU moves to ban sale of forced labour products in pointed nod to XinjiangThe EU’s strategy is designed to protect its interests – with 40 per cent of the bloc’s trade passing through the South China Sea – but also promote values such as democracy and human rights.The policy communique said the “display of force and increasing tensions in regional hotspots such as in the South and East China Sea and in the Taiwan Strait may have a direct impact on European security and prosperity”.It is part of a “multifaceted engagement with China”, through which the EU will engage on issues like climate change and biodiversity, but “push back where fundamental disagreements exist with China, such as on human rights”, it reads.The EU said it would seek “trade and investment relationships with partners with whom it does not have trade and investment agreements, such as Taiwan”.Said Borrell: “Our strategy is inclusive, it’s open to all our partners in the region. We wish to cooperate, from East Africa to the Pacific, and this includes China. On many areas, such as climate and biodiversity, China’s cooperation is essential. Our strategy is one of cooperation not confrontation.”But analysts said the EU’s position was being eclipsed both by events and by divisions within the union on exactly how active it should be in the Indo-Pacific.France, for example, favours a more forceful role, while Germany is more reluctant.“I think European nations, and especially Germany, will not contribute too much,” Nils Schmid, the foreign affairs spokesman for the German Social Democratic Party, which is leading in the country’s election polls, said last week.“Because the fact is that there is no real Indo-Pacific nation in Europe. Even the UK pretends to be an Indo-Pacific nation. But in fact, it isn’t. I think that there’s a huge amount of self delusion in Boris Johnson’s policies when it comes to the region.”The schism undermines the broader EU-wide drive to hold together a unified plan, said Hans Kundnani, director of the Europe programme at Chatham House, a British think tank.“The EU’s strategic autonomy position is becoming less relevant day by day,” he said, adding that there was more likelihood of a solid strategy emerging on a pan-European basis, including Britain.Janka Oertel, director of the Asia Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Aukus posed serious questions for the EU’s Indo-Pacific strategy.“Europeans so far have not been highly consistent in showing anything beyond rhetoric solidarity with countries challenged by Chinese coercion. This is about more than a deal on submarines. The real question is whether a US-led pushback on the security side against China in the Indo-Pacific region is in Europe’s strategic interest – or not,” she said.“If it is, then Aukus might be a valuable component of this strategy and could be complemented by Europe’s Indo-Pacific push. If it is not, then Europe will have to come up with its own answers to credibly support regional partners – and do so quickly,” Oertel added.Earlier on Thursday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the Aukus alliance was a “stab in the back” for Paris, which “had established a trusting relationship with Australia, and this trust was betrayed”.“I am today very angry and very bitter about this break-up,” said Le Drian, who likened the move to “what [former president Donald] Trump used to do”.Biden administration shrugs off pressure to remove China tariffs“This is not acceptable between allies,” the French minister said. “Especially when there was first a two-year negotiation for this contract, which began in 2014 and was completed in 2016.”White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki dismissed the comparison to Trump, and said Biden was focused on achieving “global objectives, which include security in the Indo-Pacific.”Fielding questions about France’s absence from the new pact, Psaki stressed that the alliance was “not the only global engagement or only global cooperative partnership the United States has in the world,” pointing to the G7 and G20 blocs, of which France is also a member.“[France’s] leadership up and down the ranks will continue to be important partners to the United States and to this administration moving forward,” she said.#Chesapeake240As part the 240th anniv. of the Battle of the Capes, we welcome destroyer Aquitaine on U.S. shores.

Use Google Maps speed limit warning feature to stay safe; here’s how,"Google Maps speed limit warning: Driving a vehicle is not a challenging task, and is a skill that gets better with practice. However, while driving, it is important to keep an eye on the road signs that inform you of various rules, such as parking schedules, repair work, as well as speed limits.In most countries, exceeding the speed limit is a punishable offence, and can land you in trouble. Keeping an eye on the speedometer and the speed limits on each road is an absolute must, but drivers can also use their smartphones and Google Maps to access speed limit warnings on their phone.Offered by Google as part of the app, the Google Maps Speed Limit warning feature is designed to inform users about their current speed which can be shown on their phone screen while they are driving. This is shown in addition to the details about travelling to your destination and other information, and it can come in very handy as the system can alert you if it detects you are exceeding the speed limit.It is important to note that one must never rely solely on the Google Maps Speed Limits feature and it would be important to remember that the feature is not a substitute for caution and alertness while driving. In case the data provided is incorrect or outdated, relying solely on such a feature could prove costly for users.Similarly, the feature itself is available in a limited number of countries, and users can check this list to see if their region is supported by the company – the list is regularly updated by the company.

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",7:30 PM MYT,Tech,ZHEPING HUANG，COCO LIU,Tencent opens WeChat to rivals’ links as China app walls crumble,"Tencent Holdings Ltd allowed users of its main WeChat social media service to link to rivals’ content for the first time in years, taking initial steps to comply with Beijing’s call to dismantle walls around platforms run by the country’s online giants.From Friday, users who upgrade to the latest version of the messaging service can access external services such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Taobao online mall or ByteDance Ltd’s video app Douyin, both of which were previously walled off from WeChat’s billion-plus members. That applies however only to one-on-one messaging, not group chats nor Facebook-like Moments pages.While it’s unclear whether the social giant has opened up more of its scores of online services, it’s a major step for Tencent, which along with Alibaba and ByteDance controls vast swathes of China’s Internet. In a statement announcing the move Friday, Tencent said it will also provide ways for its users to report suspicious content, and work on features for sharing links in wider group discussions.China’s top technology regulator has warned Internet firms to stop blocking links to rival services, prising open so-called walled gardens in a broader campaign to curb their growing monopoly on data and protect consumers. The government has accused a handful of companies of unfairly protecting their respective spheres: Tencent in social media via WeChat, Alibaba in e-commerce with Taobao and Tmall and, more recently, ByteDance in video via TikTok-cousin Douyin.Of the two, Alibaba is regarded as benefiting more because it will be able to tap Tencent’s billion-plus users, while Tencent – which is fiercely protective of the user experience on its apps – has less incentive to allow people to post shopping links.The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology last week summoned executives from the country’s largest online platforms to emphasise the need to end closed ecosystems that impair the flow of commerce. They’re also regarded by critics as key to helping Internet firms control user data and market dominance.China’s largest Internet corporations have historically blocked links from within their services to rivals’ content. It was unclear however what actions regulators want the big tech firms to take, and by when. Local media have reported the MIIT ordered Internet firms to begin taking action Sept 17.Alibaba and Tencent executives have said they will comply, publicly espousing a more open Chinese Internet. Earlier this year, Alibaba aimed to set up a Taobao Deals lite app on WeChat and had already invited merchants to participate, Bloomberg News reported. But Tencent executives said during the company’s most recent quarterly earnings call that it prioritises the user experience and any opening-up should be measured.ByteDance in February sued Tencent, alleging its rival violated antitrust laws by blocking access to content from Douyin on WeChat and QQ, the country’s two largest social media services by users. The Shenzhen-based company has called the allegations baseless and malicious. – Bloomberg"

We are worried that the industries would miss out on the ride of a stronger revival in demand if the shortages of foreign manpower persist,” he said.ACCCIM noted that Malaysia needs a holistic approach to handle and regulate the recruitment process under a transparent end-to-end system to apply and approve the application of foreign workers.In the medium term, the chamber said it supported the government’s calls to reduce over-dependency on foreign workers, especially the low-skilled as our country moves towards a high-income nation with the industries adopting technology and automation.The weaning off from foreign workers must not be abruptly and carried out in a gradual manner within a stipulated timeline to ease disruptions to businesses, it said.ACCCIM believed that industries and businesses are committed to working together with the authorities to design a sustainable migrant workers recruitment system based on good labour practices covering minimum standards of housing and amenities, as well as fair treatment, as stipulated under the law.""We also welcome the government’s pledge to take steps to eliminate forced labour after the country was downgraded by the US to the worst level that is Tier 3 for failing to meet minimal standards for the elimination of trafficking (of workers) and was not making significant efforts to (correct the situation).""Failure to improve the rating would put our country’s image and Malaysian companies’ reputation at risk,” it added."

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Tech,ETIENNE BALMER,Bumpy road as ageing Japan bets on self-driving cars,"TOKYO: With an ageing population in need of transport, Japan is betting on autonomous cars, but an accident involving a self-driving showcase at the Paralympics illustrates the challenges ahead.Japan is far from the only place with autonomous vehicles on the roads, but its government has set acceleration of the technology as a key priority.Last year, it became the first country in the world to allow a vehicle capable of taking full control in certain situations to operate on public roads.The Honda car has “Level 3” autonomy, meaning it can take certain decisions alone, though a driver has to be ready to take the wheel in emergencies.The government has changed the law to pave the way for increasingly advanced autonomous vehicles, and the ministry of economy, trade and industry (METI) has plans for 40 autonomous taxi test sites nationwide by 2025.It’s a policy driven by a serious problem: Japan’s population is the oldest in the world, and the country is plagued by persistent labour shortages.“In the cargo and transport sectors, drivers have become older and the shortage of human resources has become serious,” a recent METI report said.It also warned of “terrible traffic accidents caused by elderly drivers making operational errors”.With demand clear, local automakers have lined up to develop technologies.Top-selling Toyota plans to run its e-Palette self-driving buses along dedicated roads in the smart city it is building at the foot of Mount Fuji.The buses ran in the athletes’ village during the Tokyo 2020 Games, but the project was briefly suspended after a vehicle hit and lightly injured a visually impaired Paralympian.The bus had detected the man and stopped, but an operator on board overrode the system.For Christopher Richter, head of Japan research at brokerage CLSA and an automotive specialist, the incident demonstrates how far the sector has to go.“People said autonomous is ready for these kinds of controlled communities,” but even there “it failed”, he told AFP.‘Complicated areas’For rural Japan, autonomous vehicles “will become a necessity”, Richter added.“I can see why it’s a priority for the government, for carmakers... (but) big-scale autonomous driving is probably not coming in our decade.”Japan’s automakers admit the time horizon is a complex proposition at this stage.When Nissan launched tests of its “Easy Ride” self-driving taxis in 2018, it said it expected them to be commercially available from the early 2020s.But Kazuhiro Doi, the company’s global vice-president in charge of research, is more circumspect now.“Social acceptance (of autonomous cars) is not high enough,” he told AFP.“Very few people have experience with autonomous driving.

It’s better than what they expected,” Doi said.“And that kind of experience needs to be accumulated.”But he admits it is hard to say when autonomous taxis could be commercially available in Japan, noting that the Easy Ride cars currently avoid “complicated” areas with narrow or winding streets.“Unfortunately, complicated areas have customers,” he said. – AFP"
"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",8:00 PM MYT,Sport,,Tennis - Reviewing U.S. Open final win felt like watching someone else - Raducanu,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu on Friday said that re-watching her stunning victory in this month's final felt like watching someone else, adding that her achievement had started to sink in but it was still difficult to fully comprehend.The 18-year-old Briton took the tennis world by storm when she beat Canada's Leylah Fernandez, 19, in straight sets last weekend to become the first qualifier in the men's and women's game ever to win a Grand Slam title.""I think it's gradually sinking in a bit more because last night I actually just re-watched the final and tried to relive a couple of the moments and remember how it felt,"" Raducanu said in an interview with the BBC.""So it is sinking in a little bit more but it is still such a whirlwind of an experience, I've loved every moment of it, but it is something that's very difficult to fully comprehend.""It's funny because when I was watching (the final) it almost feels like that's not me who's playing and pulling off some of those shots. It feels like it's someone else.""The teenager returned to the UK and was reunited with her family after a busy few days during which she made a host of public appearances, the most high-profile being at the Met Gala in New York this week.Raducanu said the celebrations upon her return were low key. She had previously described her parents -- she has a Chinese mother and a Romanian father -- as tough and hard-to-please.""(My parents) just gave me a hug when I came back really, nothing crazy, no big celebration,"" she said.""My mum made some really good homemade dumplings, but there was nothing crazy or over-the-top. I think that they're just staying discreet and... saying they're proud of me is enough.""Raducanu's run sparked comparisons with some of the greatest achievements in sport, with marketing experts confident that she could become one of the world's most marketable athletes.Raducanu said she will leave the decision of how to spend the $2.5 million she picked up in prize money to her parents and her team and will instead focus on competing.(Reporting by Anuron Kumar Mitra in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris)"

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",8:05 AM MYT,Lifestyle,MELODY L. GOH,Hotel in Vietnam offers 'behind-the-scenes' tour to guests,"A hotel in Vietnam is offering a unique tour to future visitors – a behind-the-scenes look at the premise’s operations.Vietnam is currently facing another wave of infections, so several restrictions have been imposed across the country to curb the spread of Covid-19. This includes temporarily closing non-essential businesses like hotels and resorts.But the staff at Alma resort in Cam Ranh, located in Vietnam’s south central coastal region, are keeping themselves busy by coming up with new ideas to attract guests once restrictions are lifted.The “Back of House” tour, to be launched upon the resort’s reopening, comprises a walk through the resort’s inner workings. Tour “stops” will include the pastry room, staff canteen, engineering rooms, loading dock, laundry and uniform rooms, electric buggy station, generator station, air conditioner centralised plant, water treatment plant and security offices.ALSO READ: Time to focus on Malaysian healthcare travellers amid the pandemicTour guides and other resort employees will be ready to answer questions from guests during the tour, which will only be available twice a week.A tour like this is just one way to keep guests entertained as some hotel amenities and services – like the spa, gym and pool – may not be able to immediately resume even after the place reopens.Of course, many may not think such a tour is all that much interesting, but consider these facts: The resort has eight pastry chefs and five bakers, and together they prepare 1,220 Danish pastries, 1,000 croissants, 850 bread rolls and 800 muffins each week, as well as produce 50l of house-made ice cream, 10kg of tiramisu and more!And who knows, you may just get to enjoy some of these delicious treats while on the tour.Meanwhile, at the resort’s buggy station, try your hand at driving one of the 36 buggies on hand. Each one of these electric buggies takes an average of six hours to charge.As part of the resort’s sustainable efforts, its water treatment plant uses a reverse osmosis system that provides drinking water and ice to the kitchen, while the garbage room processes over 250kg of trash a day, mostly turning them into compostable waste and recyclables.Back to natureElsewhere, a popular resort in Krabi, Thailand is offering guests a luxurious “forest bathing” experience.Thanks to its close proximity to the Khao Ngon Nak National Park, Banyan Tree Krabi is able to include some fun back-to-nature activities like hiking, birdwatching and even picnicking.The resort, which opened in October last year, has not had the chance to welcome many guests yet, so it is banking on its nature-wellness packages to lure pandemic-weary tourists to its property.“What better way to demonstrate Banyan Tree’s commitment to well-being and the environment by offering this activity (forest bathing) to our guests,” said Banyan Tree Krabi sustainability manager Thepsuda Loyjiw in a release.“The hiking trail begins directly behind our resort, and winds up towards some spectacular viewpoints and waterfalls,” she said.The resort is located on Tubkaek Beach, which is a 45-minute drive from the Krabi International Airport.Both Krabi and Phang Nga province are scheduled to reopen several of their islands and beaches to international tourists under a “7+7” model some time this month. This model will complement the ongoing Phuket Sandbox programme, which kicked off on July 1.This means that tourists who visit Phuket would be able to cut short their mandatory 14-day stay on the island to seven days, and spend the remaining seven on either Krabi (Koh Phi Phi, Ko Ngai and Railay Beach) or Phang Nga (Khao Lak and Ko Yao)."
"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",8:09 AM MYT,Tech,ANNA IRRERA，IAIN WITHERS,"Banks beware, outsiders are cracking the code for finance","LONDON (Reuters) - Anyone can be a banker these days, you just need the right code.Global brands from Mercedes and Amazon to IKEA and Walmart are cutting out the traditional financial middleman and plugging in software from tech startups to offer customers everything from banking and credit to insurance.For established financial institutions, the warning signs are flashing.So-called embedded finance - a fancy term for companies integrating software to offer financial services - means Amazon can let customers ""buy now pay later"" when they check out and Mercedes drivers can get their cars to pay for their fuel.To be sure, banks are still behind most of the transactions but investors and analysts say the risk for traditional lenders is that they will get pushed further away from the front end of the finance chain.And that means they'll be further away from the mountains of data others are hoovering up about the preferences and behaviours of their customers - data that could be crucial in giving them an edge over banks in financial services.""Embedded financial services takes the cross-sell concept to new heights. It's predicated on a deep software-based ongoing data relationship with the consumer and business,"" said Matt Harris, a partner at investor Bain Capital Ventures.""That is why this revolution is so important,"" he said. ""It means that all the good risk is going to go to these embedded companies that know so much about their customers and what is left over will go to banks and insurance companies.""WHERE DO YOU WANT TO PLAY?For now, many areas of embedded finance are barely denting the dominance of banks and even though some upstarts have licences to offer regulated services such as lending, they lack the scale and deep funding pools of the biggest banks.But if financial technology firms, or fintechs, can match their success in grabbing a chunk of digital payments from banks - and boosting their valuations in the process - lenders may have to respond, analysts say.Stripe, for example, the payments platform behind many sites with clients including Amazon and Alphabet's Google, was valued at $95 billion in March.Accenture estimated in 2019 that new entrants to the payments market had amassed 8% of revenues globally - and that share has risen over the past year as the pandemic boosted digital payments and hit traditional payments, Alan McIntyre, senior banking industry director at Accenture, said.Now the focus is turning to lending, as well as complete off-the-shelf digital lenders with a variety of products businesses can pick and choose to embed in their processes.""The vast majority of consumer centric companies will be able to launch financial products that will allow them to significantly improve their customer experience,"" said Luca Bocchio, partner at venture capital firm Accel.""That is why we feel excited about this space.""So far this year, investors have poured $4.25 billion into embedded finance startups, almost three times the amount in 2020, data provided to Reuters by PitchBook shows.Leading the way is Swedish buy now pay later (BNPL) firm Klarna which raised $1.9 billion.DriveWealth, which sells technology allowing companies to offer fractional share trading, attracted $459 million while investors put $229 million into Solarisbank, a licensed German digital bank which offers an array of banking services software.Shares in Affirm, meanwhile, surged last month when it teamed up with Amazon to offer BNPL products while rival U.S. fintech Square said last month it was buying Australian BNPL firm Afterpay for $29 billion.Square is now worth $113 billion, more than Europe's most valuable bank, HSBC, on $105 billion.""Big banks and insurers will lose out if they don't act quickly and work out where to play in this market,"" said Simon Torrance, founder of Embedded Finance & Super App Strategies.Venture capital investment in embedded finance leaps https://graphics.reuters.com/FINTECH-EMBEDDEDFINANCE/jnvweemkgvw/chart.pngYOU NEED A LOAN!Several other retailers have announced plans this year to expand in financial services.Walmart launched a fintech startup with investment firm Ribbit Capital in January to develop financial products for its employees and customers while IKEA took a minority stake in BNPL firm Jifiti last month.Automakers such as Volkswagen's Audi and Tata's Jaguar Land Rover have experimented with embedding payment technology in their vehicles to take the hassle out of paying, besides Daimler's Mercedes.""Customers expect services, including financial services, to be directly integrated at the point of consumption, and to be convenient, digital, and immediately accessible,"" said Roland Folz, chief executive of Solarisbank which provides banking services to more than 50 companies including Samsung.It's not just end consumers being targeted by embedded finance startups. Businesses themselves are being tapped on the shoulder as their digital data is crunched by fintechs such as Canada's Shopify.It provides software for merchants and its Shopify Capital division also offers cash advances, based on an analysis of more than 70 million data points across its platform.""No merchant comes to us and says, I would like a loan. We go to merchants and say, we think it's time for funding for you,"" said Kaz Nejatian, vice president, product, merchant services at Shopify.""We don't ask for business plans, we don't ask for tax statements, we don't ask for income statements, and we don't ask for personal guarantees. Not because we are benevolent but because we think those are bad signals into the odds of success on the internet,"" he said.A Shopify spokesperson said funding goes from $200 to $2 million. It has provided $2.3 billion in cumulative capital advances and is valued at $184 billion, well above Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest traditional lender.CONNECTED FUTURE?Shopify's lending business is, however, still dwarfed by the big banks. JPMorgan Chase & Co, for example, had a consumer and community loan book worth $435 billion at the end of June.Major advances into finance by companies from other sectors could also be limited by regulators.Officials from the Bank for International Settlements, a consortium of central banks and financial regulators, warned watchdogs last month to get to grips with the growing influence of technology firms in finance.Bain's Harris said financial regulators were taking the approach that because they don't know how to regulate tech firms they are insisting there's a bank behind every transaction - but that did not mean banks would prevent fintechs encroaching.""They are right that the banks will always have a role but it's not a very remunerative role and it involves very little ownership of the customer,"" he said.Forrester analyst Jacob Morgan said banks had to decide where they want to be in the finance chain.""Can they afford to fight for customer primacy, or do they actually see a more profitable route to market to become the rails that other people run on top of?"" he said. ""Some banks will choose to do both."" And some are already fighting back.Citigroup has teamed up with Google on bank accounts, Goldman Sachs is providing credit cards for Apple and JPMorgan is buying 75% of Volkswagen's payments business and plans to expand to other industries. 06:00:00 ""Connectivity between different systems is the future,"" said Shahrokh Moinian, head of wholesale payments, EMEA, at JPMorgan.

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",8:45 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,"In American author Sandra Cisneros' new book, an overdue letter to a friend","With her new book, Martita, I Remember You, Sandra Cisneros feels like she's finally answered a long overdue letter.The author of the best-selling novella The House On Mango Street is back with her first work of fiction in almost a decade, a story of memory and friendship, but also about the experiences young women endure as immigrants worldwide.Inspired by Cisneros' own time in Paris as a young, aspiring writer, Martita follows Corina, a woman in her 20s who has left her Mexican family in Chicago to pursue literary dreams in the city where Ernest Hemingway, James Baldwin and many others lived. During her brief time there, she finds herself struggling with money, befriending panhandling artists and sleeping on crowded floors with other immigrants.Supporting her through it all are Martita and Paola, an Argentine and an Italian as broke as she was.Over the years, the three disperse to different continents, eventually falling out of touch, until Corina finds a series of old letters in a drawer that bring back intense memories of those days together.""It began from a place in my own memory, with the real Martita that inspired this story - real Martitas, I should say, because we meet so many in our lives, women that come and befriend us and have nothing. It’s always the people that have nothing that give the most,” Cisneros said in a recent interview via Zoom from San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.""So, what began as a real story about things that happened to me ‘se infló’ (inflated) - it went to other places,” she continued.Martita, I Remember You (Vintage Original) was published last week as a dual-language paperback featuring Cisneros’ English story on the front and, when flipped over, Liliana Valenzuela’s Spanish translation, Martita, te recuerdo.Born in Chicago to Mexican parents, Cisneros is one of the most prominent Latino authors in the United States, with honours including the 1985 National Book Award for The House On Mango Street, the PEN/Nabokov Award for International Literature and the 2015 National Medal of Arts.She started writing the story about Martita in the late 1980s, early 1990s, with the idea of including it in her award-winning collection Woman Hollering Creek. But she only had the first part of the story written, and her editor felt there was more to it.In the last couple of years, she pulled it out again and added a middle and an end.""I guess they needed me to be older to be able to write that part,” Cisneros said with a laugh. ""I don’t know how old I was, my 30s? Yeah. I couldn’t write the ending because I was too young! Even though Corina is about 36... I am not as wise as Corina. The author needed to be older to get the long view, to see it.”The book takes us back to a time before emails and cellphones, when people would exchange physical addresses to stay in touch. There was the elation of getting letters from afar; Corina reads and re-reads the ones she got.""Actually, the first letter is based on a real letter that came to me after I had left. Years had passed... and a real letter came that triggered a feeling that I didn’t have a name for,” said Cisneros.""This whole story is my letter that I never mailed back to her, or to all of the Martitas that befriended me when I was floating around in the world. I felt like I had to write this unsent letter to understand what it was that I experienced in these very random, short (relationships with) people that I met when I was travelling.""Although she set her book in France in the 1980s, Cisneros, whose works have always had immigration as a theme, hopes people relate to the story today.""It’s still very relevant now to every country, and especially the United States,” she said, adding that she’s ""ashamed to be living in this time and to know that I’m a citizen of a country that separates children from their parents and who are treating refugees worse that animals. So I hope that this book will help to awaken people, make change.""I absolutely believe that art can make change, because it’s made such a big change in my life.”Cisneros recalls ""the generosity of strangers” when she lived abroad, and said it helped her ""understand what it is like for immigrants now, coming to the United States, being vilified, being looked down upon the way that Parisians, you know, looked down at us.... I understood my father and I understood the immigrants’ situation now in a way that maybe I couldn’t, so I’m glad I lived that experience.”If she could hear back from Martita, what would she tell her?""Oh! I would be so happy! I would say: ‘Martita, where are you? I’m coming! What happened to you?’ I would love to see Martita again. I forgot her last name, I don’t know where she is, but she is the one that triggered these stories from many women that are connected,” said Cisneros.She is currently finishing a book of poetry that will come out next fall in English and Spanish: Woman Without Shame”/ ""Mujer sin vergüenza. She is also working on the libretto of an opera adaptation of The House On Mango Street with New York composer Derek Bermel, as well as on a pilot for a TV series based on that book. - AP"

Those included real Nobel laureates announcing the prizes, and the world premiere of a mini opera called A Bridge Between People, about children who literally build tiny suspension bridges to join two angry adults.No faces were punched for the beard study published in the scientific journal Integrative Organismal Biology.Instead, University of Utah scientists Ethan Beseris, Steven Naleway and David Carrier used a fibre epoxy composite to simulate human bone, and sheepskin to act as the human skin – sometimes with the fleece still on, sometimes sheared. They then dropped weights on them.The sample with the fleece still attached absorbed more energy than the sheared samples.""If the same is true for human facial hair, then having a full beard may help protect vulnerable regions of the facial skeleton from damaging strikes, such as the jaw,” they said. ""Presumably, full beards also reduce injury, laceration and contusion to the skin and muscle of the face.""Far-reaching implicationsIt's obvious that those wads of discarded chewing gum found on sidewalks around the world are pretty revolting.But just how revolting?Researchers from a Spanish university determined the already-chewed gum that has been stuck to the sidewalk for three months is teeming with nasty bacteria.It sounds like a silly study, but as usual, there was some method to the madness.""Our findings have implications for a wide range of disciplines, including forensics, contagious disease control, or bioremediation of wasted chewing gum residues,"" Leila Satari, Alba Guillen, Angela Vidal-Verdu, and Manuel Porcar from the University of Valencia wrote in their paper, which was published at Nature.com.Meanwhile, a team of US Navy researchers won for figuring out a cheaper and more effective way to control cockroaches on submarines. The 1971 study that appeared in the Journal of Economic Entomology found that traditional methods such as carboxide fumigation and use of the pesticide malathion were not good enough.They found that using the pesticide dichlorvos was less expensive and more effective.The goal is to return next year's ceremony to its traditional home at Harvard University's Sanders Theatre, Abrahams said, but much depends on whether the pandemic is under control and what kind of travel restrictions are in place around the world. – AP"

The two finally shared their story during an interview with Singapore's Shin Min Daily News on Sept 14.The Ah Boys To Men 4 actor said he met his brother in 2014 after being apart for over 28 years. Lian, 36, revealed that Kevin Soh, who is a year younger to him, was in fact given away to another family after birth in exchange for a red packet.Meanwhile, Soh shared that he had discovered the existence of an older brother when he was 18.“Ryan came to look for me at my home and through the gate, I saw a young man standing outside,” he said.However, Soh's adopted mother did not permit the two to meet, sending Lian home.Upon discovering that the truth was kept from him, Soh did not speak to his adoptive mother for two weeks.Lian, on the other hand, shared his side of the encounter. “At the time, I just wanted to find out if he was a gangster or a studious boy.”After learning his younger brother was doing well, he promised Soh’s mother that he would leave his brother alone.It wasn’t until years later that their paths crossed once again, when Soh had signed up as a participant for Mediacorp’s variety show Smart At Work.While on the show, an actor had commented that Soh resembled the Long Long Time Ago actor.

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",9:15 PM MYT,Asean+,KOK XINGHUI IN SINGAPORE (SCMP),Singapore foreign minister’s apology lays bare angst over elite school obsession and class divide,"SINGAPORE, Sept 17 (SCMP): When Singapore’s foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan remarked on an opposition politician’s educational background to a party colleague in parliament on Tuesday, he did not expect what he said to go viral.But his asides were caught on microphone – and with the session being live-streamed, an audio clip with the comments “He’s illiterate”, “Seriously, how did he get into RI?” and “Must be a lousy school” quickly made the rounds.Online, public attention focused more on the exchange than the serious debate taking place in parliament, on the need for Singapore to remain open to foreigners.RI, for Raffles Institution, is a household acronym in the country of 5.7 million – 20 per cent of the current cabinet attended the school, as did the country’s late independence leader Lee Kuan Yew.It is unclear whether all three comments were made by the same person, but Balakrishnan on Wednesday said he had called the politician – Leong Mun Wai, one of the Progress Singapore Party’s two parliamentary representatives – to apologise for “my private comments to a colleague”.“I disagree with him on the [debated] issue, but I should not have said what I said. Mr Leong has accepted my apology,” Balakrishnan wrote in a Facebook post.For some Singaporeans, the episode reflects a stark reality in an academically driven society – that one’s worth and capability are measured by the schools they went to.This belief has fuelled an ongoing obsession with brand-name schools that offer educational advantages and social connections that can propel success even in a meritocratic system.Some social media users shared examples of how, in social gatherings or during job interviews, they were asked about which school they attended, with the answer being seen as a mark of their intellect and leadership ability.For others, the minister’s remarks are at odds with the ruling People’s Action Party’s assertion that there are multiple pathways to success and one’s schooling does not define their life outcomes.To former government strategy officer turned consulting firm owner Devadas Krishnadas, the comments were revealing of the leadership’s “belief in a ‘natural aristocracy’, destined to rule Singapore on the sheer basis of their academic achievements”.In a post on LinkedIn, Krishnadas said he felt a “visceral disquiet” from the questions the episode had raised. “How are we viewed by certain PAP leaders? How are we valued by them?” he wrote.Top schoolsRI was founded by the British colonialist Stamford Raffles in 1823. The school’s modern-day iteration comprises a boys-only high school and a co-educational junior college section.RI’s sister school, the girls-only Raffles Girls’ School (RGS), is equally well known. RI and RGS have for decades been viewed as among the top Asian feeder schools for leading global universities, with many attending these institutions on government scholarships.Leong, the opposition politician, graduated from RI in 1977 and won a government scholarship to study in Japan. The 62-year-old worked in the finance sector there and in Hong Kong, and now runs a venture capital firm in Singapore.Leong has been active in calling for a “rebalancing” of the foreign-local workforce ratio, including imposing levies on expatriates to ensure locals get a better shot at jobs.In particular, he has criticised the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), a free-trade pact with India, pointing to how it allows for intra-corporate transfers among multinational firms that are heavily slanted in India’s favour and alleging that it fuels unfettered immigration.The PAP government has pushed back against such claims, saying they are baseless and fomenting anti-Indian sentiment in the multiracial nation.Tuesday’s debate arose following a motion filed by Leong, and saw several ministers rise to challenge the opposition politician’s sharp criticism of CECA. At times, he appeared unprepared for the grilling, stating repeatedly that he required additional data from officials before he could take a decisive stance on the pact’s merits.After the marathon parliamentary session on Tuesday, which went from 11am until 12.30am the next morning, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong praised lawmakers who defended the city state’s openness to foreigners, saying they had taken “a firm and unequivocal stance against racism and xenophobia”.In a statement to the media on Thursday, Leong said he had accepted Balakrishnan’s apology but was “also curious to know who are the other persons who were involved in the conversation and the reason why they held the institution that I attended in contempt”.Leong was referring to how the comments were made as manpower minister Tan See Leng, who had just finished his response to a question from Leong, returned to his seat with Balakrishnan on his left and finance minister Lawrence Wong one seat down.Tan’s comment “I am from Monk’s Hill” – referring to the now-defunct government high school he attended – was also captured by the microphone.‘Closed social circles’To tame competition for elite school places, Singapore’s authorities have stressed that “every school is a good school”, and have promoted social mixing across schools while ordering top institutions to take in more students from different backgrounds.But sociologist Tan Ern Ser said no matter the mantra, society would have its own markers of what constituted “good”.“I reckon whether or not every school is officially a good school, people, together with like-minded others, may still subscribe to their own ranking metrics, which may differ from the official version,” said Tan from the National University of Singapore (NUS).A 2017 study on social capital by the Institute of Policy Studies think tank found that someone who went to an elite school might have ties to those from elite and non-elite schools, but a person who attended a non-elite school had hardly any ties to people from elite schools.Officials, including Prime Minister Lee, have in the past expressed concern about this trend. In 2018, he said the government was aware of anxieties surrounding class divisions that arose from educational backgrounds and other social cues.If social mobility was frustrated, “soon the elite group would start to only look after their own interests, and fail in their duty to lead and care for the rest of society”, said Lee, who attended Catholic High School, one of the country’s elite institutions.The situation is not unique to Singapore. “Old boys or gendered networks that foster in-group elitism are a common feature of many societies. We see this also with political elites in the UK, for example,” said Nanyang Technological University sociologist Laavanya Kathiravelu.Twenty of Britain’s 55 prime ministers were educated at Eton College, an elite all-boys boarding school, while in China, The Experimental High School Attached to Beijing Normal University is a top institution attended by children of politicians and elite businesspeople.Tan, the sociologist, said school pride and strong alumni networks among elite school graduates could mean a tendency to form “closed social circles that do not overlap with others”.This may have been why some users on the Reddit forum quipped that Balakrishnan’s comments were motivated by competitive spirit.Foreign minister Balakrishnan attended RI’s fierce rival, the Anglo-Chinese School, before studying medicine at the National University of Singapore on a President’s scholarship.A commenter on the Reddit forum asked why schooling would be an issue for someone of the 60-year-old minister’s age. “I don’t understand why many older people still discuss what secondary school/[junior college] they went to,” it read. “It happened 40 years ago, big deal.” - South China Morning Post"

""Workers at fruit-processing factories are required by the government to stay on site, test against Covid-19 regularly, and they are vaccinated.”China is the top destination for Vietnamese dragon fruit -- representing over 80% of total shipments and amounting to $1 billion a year, according to Nguyen. Dragon fruits make up one third of Vietnam’s exports of vegetables and fruits, which was $3.27 billion last year, he said.The halt is the latest blow to Vietnam’s fruit trade with China, which was already seeing a decline in exports amid land transport congestion, tighter border controls and increased domestic plantings in China, said Nguyen.China has been vigilantly testing imported foods -- particularly meat and seafood -- for traces of the virus, despite the World Health Organization saying there’s no evidence of people catching the virus from food and food packaging. Beijing, which is facing a Covid-19 outbreak in Fujian province, has been on high alert for any potential spread of the virus ahead of major holidays.The country has also suspended other fruit shipments recently, including Taiwan pineapples that was seen as a political move amid deteriorating cross-strait relations. China turned away cherries earlier this year after authorities found the virus on the inner packaging of the fruit found in Jiangsu province.Guangxi officials said the dragon fruit halt will extend for another week if coronavirus is detected again, using the PCR testing method, on the packaging of dragon fruits or any products shipped from Vietnam, according to the ministry. The third detection will result in a four-week suspension. - Bloomberg"

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",3:00 PM MYT,Tech,MICHAEL BERENS,One US state stands out in restricting corporate use of biometrics: Illinois,"ST. LOUIS: When night fell, a clerk at a bustling 24-hour MotoMart flipped a switch from behind the counter.Electromagnetic locks sealed the doorway. A window sign, now illuminated in red, warned “facial recognition technology in use” and directed customers to “look up at the camera”.On this recent weeknight, a woman who wanted cigarettes was locked out. Confused at first, she quickly realised that she needed to remove her medical mask. After her unobstructed facial image was scanned into a store computer, then screened against the company’s photo archives of previous customers convicted of store-related crimes, the doors clicked open.Just a few miles away, across the Missouri state line in Illinois, such screening is against the law under the toughest privacy laws in the country. Private companies must obtain written consent before stockpiling facial images or any biometric identifier – fingerprints, palms, eyes and voice.The contrast speaks to America’s digital privacy divide. On one side is Illinois, along with two other states and several US cities that currently require some form of public disclosure or consent to biometric screening. On the other is the rest of the country, including Missouri, where private sector uses are by and large unrestricted.Illinois’ law prohibits private sector companies and institutions from collecting biometric data from unsuspecting citizens in the state or online, no matter where the business is based. Data cannot be sold, transferred or traded. Unlike any other state, citizens can sue for alleged violations, which has sparked hundreds of David-and-Goliath legal battles against some of the world’s most powerful companies.A Reuters review of nearly 750 individual and class-action suits filed in Illinois since 2015 found widespread evidence that private companies, without disclosure or consent, have collected, tagged and categorised biometric data gleaned from millions of unsuspecting Americans. Most suits have been filed since 2019, when the Illinois Supreme Court, in a bombshell decision, ruled plaintiffs did not have to show harm to collect damages.Privacy advocates warn that the swift, largely unchecked growth of such tracking technologies has outpaced existing laws in most states, leaving individuals vulnerable to identity theft, invasion of privacy and discriminatory practices. Unlike a credit card or driver license, a person’s biometric data is unique and cannot be changed or replaced.The MotoMart system is designed to protect privacy with tamper-proof software that prohibits owners from importing or exporting biometric data involving any outside source, said Thomas Sawyer, a retired St. Louis police detective. He co-founded Blue Line Technology, LLC, which created the store’s face recognition system, with a group of former and active law enforcement officers.“We want people to know they are being watched,” he said. “That’s why we have signs and a flashing light.”Court records show that many companies use biometric systems to track employee and student performance or monitor customers in order to develop marketing and sales strategies. The suits detail how companies or institutions allegedly used a fingerprint database of amusement park visitors, including children, to look for signs of ticket fraud; examined college students’ eye movements and typing cadence for signs of cheating; and monitored employee interactions – whom they talked to and for how long – and frequency of their bathroom breaks.Cases are also pending against global web-based giants including Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google, as well as brick-and-mortar corporations such as McDonald’s Corp. The food chain is accused of recording voices of some drive-thru customers to track purchasing patterns, according to the suit. Complaints against the four companies are pending. All four declined to comment.In court papers, Amazon, Apple and Google denied any violation of Illinois’ law, maintaining that privacy disclosures were provided to all users. Also in court filings, McDonald’s disputed the accusations against the company and asserted that voice data was used for training purposes and “not to identify individual speakers”.If a company is found to have violated Illinois law, citizens can collect civil penalties up to US$5,000 per violation compounded by the number of people affected and days involved. No state regulatory agency is involved in enforcement.Some companies have opted for staggering settlements. Facebook settled for US$650mil (RM2.71bil) last year following accusations that the social media giant collected millions of facial photos without proper consent. Earlier this year, Tik Tok’s China-based parent ByteDance settled for US$92 (RM383) involving similar allegations. Neither company acknowledged wrongdoing and neither responded to Reuters requests for comment.At least half of pending suits involve regional or local companies. A court verdict or settlement – even for violations that did not result in measurable harm – could be financially crippling and lead to layoffs, said Jack Lavin, chief executive officer and president of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce.“Illinois law has been weaponised,” he said. “It’s created a cottage industry for suing companies.”The US Chamber of Commerce’s Institute for Legal Reform labels Illinois a “judicial hell hole”.Fingerprinting at the grocery storeIt seemed like an idea out of science fiction: using a fingerprint scanner to buy groceries. But in 2008, a California company swept into Illinois with just such a futuristic online marketing pitch: “Imagine this. At checkout, you place your finger on a small scanner. Instantly you see a list of your payment accounts on a screen, checking account, credit or debit card... no cards, checks, cash – or hassle.”Soon after shoppers signed up, the company declared bankruptcy. Court filings revealed that the company planned to liquidate inventory, including the fingerprint database, to outside companies.The Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union leapt to action and sponsored legislation that became the Illinois Biometric Information and Privacy Act, or BIPA. The California company’s fingerprint database was destroyed.“We aren’t trying to ban technology,” said spokesman Ed Yohnka. “We want to put protections in place to control, manage, inform and obtain consent.”Only two other states currently enforce comprehensive biometric privacy laws. Texas and Washington regulate compliance through a government agency, like an attorney general, a Reuters review of state records show. However, both states’ laws are generally viewed as weaker than Illinois’ mandates by privacy advocates; agencies often seek voluntary reform if violations are substantiated. California will implement more comprehensive privacy protections in 2022, which will limit how data is collected and create a new state regulatory agency focused on consumer privacy laws.Meanwhile, pro-business groups are fighting to modify Illinois’ law.In January, the Chicago chamber of commerce sponsored legislation to soften financial penalties and eliminate citizens’ right to sue, known in legal parlance as a “private right to action”. The measure failed for lack of support.‘We could do all kinds of stuff with this!’The Missouri MotoMart was the first store in the US to install the surveillance lock-out device created by Blue Line. The firm represents one of dozens of nascent companies in America that are struggling to gain prominence in the facial recognition industry, focusing on small businesses with tight budgets.Blue Line launched in 2015 after Sawyer visited his friend, Marcos Silva, a former military software programmer who now works as a St. Louis police detective.“Do you want to see something in my garage?” Sawyer recalled Silva asking.Silva demonstrated a prototype for a face recognition program. Sawyer said he blurted, “We could do all kinds of stuff with this!”Today, Blue Line oversees about 50 systems, which cost about US$10,000 (RM41,710) each, in convenience stores and gas stations in 12 states. A private Catholic high school in suburban St. Louis also uses the Blue Line system to verify student identities before they can enter the building.But Blue Line confronts a shifting regulatory landscape. A Portland store abandoned its system after the city council voted to prohibit private sector use of face recognition beginning this year. The ban does not apply to government or law enforcement.Dozens of cities are now weighing new biometric restrictions. New York City modelled much of its new privacy law this year after Illinois; businesses are required to publicly and prominently disclose when biometric systems are used.Cities should “press pause” on allowing biometric technologies until laws require public transparency and corporate accountability, said Alan Butler, executive director of Wash. D.C.-based Electronic Privacy Information Center.Without legal safeguards, he said, real-time face recognition systems like the one developed by Blue Line represent a “systemic threat to privacy”.But Sawyer said he has proof Blue Line’s program works. He showed Reuters a six-second video from July 2018 at an AM/PM convenience store in Yakima, Washington.At 1.20am, two young men wearing ski masks dashed to the store’s front door. Both appeared to clutch handguns under dark clothing. One man pulled the door handle, locked by Blue Line’s system.

"Friday, 17 Sep 2021",7:10 PM MYT,Tech,JULIA LOVE，MOIRA WARBURTON,Exclusive-Amazon faces Teamsters union drive at nine Canadian sites,"(Reuters) -The Teamsters Union has launched campaigns to organize employees in at least nine Canadian facilities of U.S. e-commerce company Amazon.com, according to Reuters interviews with union officials.The influential union took the first step earlier this week to organize employees at one of Amazon's Canadian facilities, and the interviews reveal it is widening such efforts across the country, where the e-commerce company employs about 25,000 workers and plans to add 15,000 more.The campaigns could be seen as a bet by the Teamsters that early success unionizing employees in a more labor-friendly market such as Canada will inspire similar results south of the border, where Amazon has so far fended off unionization attempts.In the latest challenge to Amazon's anti-unionization stance, Edmonton, Alberta's Teamsters Local Union 362 filed for a vote on union representation at a company fulfillment center in nearby Nisku late on Monday.Interviews with Teamsters units in other cities and provinces show that the union's efforts stretch from the Pacific coastal province of British Columbia to the Canadian economic heartland in southern Ontario.The Teamsters' Edmonton unit says it has enough signed cards calling for a union to meet the 40% threshold to require a vote. Two of the union's units in Ontario and one in Alberta have confirmed they are signing membership cards with Amazon workers.Two of the five units that confirmed to Reuters that they are organizing also said they are running campaigns at multiple sites, bringing the total Amazon facilities involved in some level of organizing to at least nine.“Any locals that have an Amazon facility in their area are doing an organizing campaign,” Jim Killey, an organizer with Teamsters Local 879 near Hamilton, Ontario, told Reuters.Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier in the week Amazon Canada spokesperson Dave Bauer said in an emailed statement: ""As a company, we don't think unions are the best answer for our employees.""Unions, he added, would prevent the company from changing quickly to meet employees' needs and represent ""the voices of a select few.""The Teamsters say they can help workers win better wages and benefits, such as leaves of absence.SLEEPING IN THEIR CARSUnionization votes in Canada do not have any direct bearing on the United States, but they could raise enthusiasm, said John Logan, a labor professor at San Francisco State University.“Organizing at a place like Amazon requires workers to take a certain amount of risk,” Logan said. “If they can look to other places and see that that risk has paid off for other workers, then they are far more inclined to do it themselves.”Union members are going to great lengths to connect with Amazon workers, sleeping in their cars to catch the employees after graveyard shifts and forging ties at local churches.The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has more than a million members in the United States and Canada, has made organizing Amazon a top priority, describing it as an “existential threat.""Amazon does not have any unionized facilities in North America. The Teamsters is one of a handful of unions trying to undertake the daunting task of organizing the online retailer's vast, high-churn workforce.Earlier this year, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) lost a vote to organize Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, by a more than two-to-one margin. Amazon pushed hard against unionization, and the result is being disputed.The Teamsters have indicated they will not seek to hold such votes in the United States any time soon, arguing that the process is unfairly tilted toward employers.But in Canada, where labor laws are more favorable, the Teamsters see an opportunity to go straight to the ballot box.The organization is handing out leaflets at facilities across the country.""You just want to see who bites,"" the Teamsters' Killey said. ""You throw your lines in the water and see which fish bites first.""Killey said his chapter is campaigning at Amazon facilities in Milton, Cambridge and Kitchener, all traditionally working-class towns just west of Toronto, Canada’s most populous city.""Where we see there is a lot of support, we're going to go full steam ahead,"" said Christopher Monette, spokesperson for Teamsters Canada.Jason Sweet, president of Teamsters Local 419 in Ontario, said his unit has begun signing cards with workers in the greater Toronto area and has formed WhatsApp groups with Amazon workers to keep them abreast of the union’s efforts, delivering updates every 48 hours or so. ""We are trying to build relationships from the inside,"" he said.In British Columbia, Teamsters Local 31 President Stan Hennessy said potential members have been very interested.“It’s our hope that we can help these workers,” he said. “They certainly can use some help.”(Reporting by Julia Love in San Francisco and Moira Warburton in Vancouver; Editing by Peter Henderson, Muralikumar Anantharaman and Dan Grebler)"

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,THOMAS HUONG,Brighter outlook for Malaysia’s oil and gas sector,"RISING global oil prices amidst increasing Covid-19 vaccination rates and anticipated higher world economic growth rates in 2022 are brightening the outlook for Malaysia’s oil and gas sector, say research analysts.According to the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in its latest monthly oil market report, world oil demand is projected to hit 100.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.This is compared against global oil demand in 2021, which is now projected to average 96.7 million b/d.“As vaccination rates rise, the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to be better managed and economic activities and mobility will firmly return to pre-Covid-19 levels. Steady economic developments are expected to support the partially delayed recovery in oil demand in various sectors,” said the cartel.Opec pointed out that United States growth is forecast at 6.1% in 2021, supported by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, followed by projected growth of 4.1% in 2022, with further potential upside that may come from additional fiscal stimulus.Growth in the eurozone has also picked up strongly, especially in the second quarter of 2021, with economic growth for the entire year forecast at 4.7%, followed by 3.8% in 2022.Meanwhile, China’s first half of 2021 (H1’21) gross domestic product (GDP) figures confirmed a stable economic recovery, albeit the renewed Covid-19 variant outbreak is forecast to limit 2021 growth at 8.5%.“China’s anticipated softening of the H2’21 growth momentum is forecast to continue into 2022, leading to growth of 6%. India’s growth is forecast at 9% for 2021 and 6.8% in 2022,” said the cartel.Meanwhile, Opec noted that global oil demand in the third quarter of 2021 (Q3’21) has proved to be resilient, supported by rising mobility and travelling activities, particularly in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).However, H2’21 global oil demand has been adjusted slightly lower, partially delaying the oil demand recovery into H1’22 due to the increased risk of Covid-19 cases primarily fuelled by the Delta variant, clouding oil demand prospects going into the final quarter of the year, resulting in downward adjustments to Q4’21 estimates.Meanwhile, AmInvestment Bank Research maintains its “overweight” call on the oil and gas sector, and says it likes Dialog Group Bhd for its resilient non-cyclical tank terminal and maintenance-based operations, as well as Yinson Holdings Bhd’s strong earnings growth momentum from the full-year contributions of floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels Helang, off Sarawak, Abigail-Joseph in Nigeria and Anna Nery in Brazil, plus multiple charter opportunities in Brazil and Africa.The research unit noted that Yinson had recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to supply a mid-sized FPSO vessel to Enauta’s Atlanta field in Brazil.AmInvestment Bank Research also likes Sapura Energy Bhd as its completed RM10bil debt restructuring package positions the formidable engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (EPCIC) group to secure fresh global orders.“Meanwhile, Petronas Gas Bhd offers highly compelling dividend yields from its optimal capital structure strategy and resilient earnings base,” said the research unit.AmInvestment Bank Research is maintaining its 2021 to 2022 oil price projection at US$65 to US$70 (RM271 to RM292) per barrel as Brent crude oil prices have recovered above US$70 (RM292) per barrel currently after falling to US$65 (RM271) per barrel on Aug 20 this year on concerns that the Covid-19 Delta variant could dampen global demand.The research unit said while United States shale production could rebound and Opec may continue to raise production quotas against the backdrop of the brighter oil price environment, this could be mitigated by rising global demand on the back of Covid-19 vaccine rollouts in H2’21.However, AmInvestment Bank Research pointed out that the pandemic had impacted Q2’21 order flows to Malaysian oil and gas operators.“Contract rollouts are still being impacted by the global pandemic, movement restrictions and energy transition policies, which caused Q2’21 awards to decrease 33% quarter-on-quarter to RM2.2bil,” said the research unit. It pointed out that while new contract awards in H1’21 to Malaysian oil and gas operators (excluding Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd in light of its accounting issues raised by its former auditor) rebounded 2.6 times year-on-year to RM5.6bil, largely from multiple jobs awarded to Sapura Energy - the sharp recovery stems from the spending collapse to only RM569mil in Q1’20 due to the earlier Saudi-Russia price war and onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.This is reflected in Petronas’ H1’21 capital expenditure (capex) decreasing by 14% year-on-year to RM12.7bil mainly due to project delays and rephasing of activities caused by movement restriction orders.AmInvestment Bank Research noted that H1’21 appears to be below Petronas’ annual capex plans, accounting for 28% to 32% of the national company’s target of RM40bil to RM45bil over the next five years. As a comparison, H1’21 accounted for 33% to 44% of the group’s capex over the past three years.Petronas plans to spend 55% of the annual capex allocation on domestic investments, with the remainder on international investments.Meanwhile, KAF Equities’ research unit also maintains its “overweight” call on the oil and gas sector, and favours companies with exposure to the downstream and tanker businesses.“The upstream service provider subsegment is showing early signs of recovery,” said the research unit, adding Upstream Online news portal had reported that Petronas Carigali is carrying out studies for the potential deployment of a FPSO vessel on its Sepat oilfield offshore Peninsular Malaysia.While market sources said the concept of an FPSO at Sepat is not new, and there is still no guarantee that it will proceed, KAF Equities said this could still be an opportunity for local FPSO players namely Bumi Armada Bhd, Yinson and MISC due to Petronas previous track record of preference for local service providers.While the size of the potential project is undisclosed for now, KAF Equities estimates the new FPSO might involve daily production capacity of up to 50,000 b/d range for it to be worthwhile for Petronas to spend on the asset upgrade. Also, the Sepat field is likely to require further development or drilling to boost its production to justify extra capex for the new FPSO.KAF Equities said for comparison purposes, it believes it would be smaller than recent proposed supply by Yinson of a mid-sized FPSO vessel to Enauta’s Atlanta field in Brazil, indicating that the potential capex for this Sepat project to be US$500mil (RM2bil) to US$600mil (2.5bil) or lower.“Judging from balance sheet capabilities, we expect MISC and Yinson to be strong candidates if there is a bid, whereas we do not discount the possibility of non-listed players competing as well,” said the research unit.Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research also maintains its “overweight” call on the oil and gas sector, and said its fundamentals are turning positive, with higher oil prices, stronger commitment from Opec+ to keep oil prices afloat, higher impending capex from Petronas in H2’21 albeit not at pre-Covid levels, timeline of vaccine rollouts and the strong economic recovery from China, United States and Europe.HLIB Research’s top picks are Bumi Armada (buy; target price: 80 sen) for its strong FPSO business and fast improving balance sheet and Dialog (buy; target price: RM3.45) as the research unit believes that its share price has bottomed out and its growth in sustainable earnings and potential for further expansions for its tank terminals business will provide upside.The research unit also expects Petronas to elevate its capex spending in H2’21 as its financial performance has improved significantly, and this is expected to benefit most oil and gas services companies in Malaysia.HLIB Research maintains its Brent crude oil price per barrel forecast at US$70 to US$75 (RM292 to RM313) for 2021 and 2022 as its believes that Opec + is committed to provide a good equilibrium for oil prices.“Increasing demand from the re-opening of economies globally would neutralise Opec+’s easing of production cuts, providing a stable oil price of around US$70 (RM292) per barrel in 2021,” said the research unit.However, Kenanga Research maintains its “neutral” call on the sector, saying that undamentals still remain largely weak, with a long-term oil price outlook of US$55 to US$60 (RM229 to RM250) per barrel.Kenanga Research also noted that Petronas group has recently agreed to increase its financial year 2021 (FY’21) dividends by RM7bil to RM25bil, from RM18bil previously.“While the group should have no problems meeting this commitment, given its net-cash position of RM60bil – we do note that this is still halved from two years ago (end-2019 net-cash position of RM117bil),” said the research unit.Kenanga Research also said while upstream is still the largest area of investment for Petronas, it believes this trend of gradually diminishing upstream spending could likely continue, as the group might seek to divert some of its investments into other renewable energy sectors in efforts to keep up with current energy transition trends.Overall, considering Petronas’ increased dividend commitments and efforts in energy transition, the research unit believes the recovery of activity levels – particularly for local-centric contractors (Velesto Energy Bhd, Uzma Bhd, Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd) could still be rather slow.“Realistically, we do not expect activity levels to revert back to pre-pandemic levels any time before 2023”, said Kenanga Research."

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,,Early economic resumption vital,"THE rising number of Covid-19 cases since early May 2021 resulted in a nationwide movement control order (MCO 3.0) in mid-May, which was followed by a nationwide lockdown in early June.The restrictive measure has paralysed large parts of economic and social activities across the country.As a consequences of the stringent measures, manufacturing activities in several key areas were affected severely, in particular Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. Factories were forced to scale down their operations or shut down to comply with the new measures to address the pandemic.The restrictive measures affected a wide range of industries and suppliers in these regions and this resulted in a crippling impact on the global manufacturing supply chains which struggled with supply capacities and delivery times. It will be tough for them to clear their backlogs of orders swiftly.An important point to note here is that manufacturers and suppliers in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur are varied, including high-value manufacturing industries in the fields of engineering and manufacturing, automotive, healthcare, chemicals and technology and many others.As a result, it also impacted companies outside Selangor and Kuala Lumpur which experienced disruptions as their sub-tier suppliers are located in the two affected regions.Companies that produce capacitors for the automotive and telecommunications industries, and medical device makers were hit by the MCO 3.0 as many of their sub-tier suppliers located in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur were forced to shut down.The impact from MCO 3.0 caused those in the automotive and iron and steel segments to halt their operations until the restrictive measures were relaxed. Several carmakers closed their factories on June 1.And even sectors that were allowed to operate at 60% of their workforce shut down their operations temporarily due to the pandemic outbreak, labour shortages or other operational challenges.For instance, our big players in areas like styrene monomer producer, refined tin maker, semiconductor players, electronic components makers and many more had to stop operations. Meanwhile, factories which were allowed to operate without restrictions under MCO 3.0 experienced a drop in productivity.The Semiconductor Industry Association found that MCO 3.0 had reduced our semiconductor output by 15%-40% and cut inventory levels although semiconductor makers were exempted from the restrictions due to supply issues, labour shortages and rising Covid-19 cases.Major component suppliers who manufacture multi-layer ceramic capacitors and crystal oscillators used in a wide range of electronic products were all affected.The crippling impact from MCO 3.0 was reflected in the headline IHS Markit Malaysia manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI).Data from the PMI suggested that output slipped for the fourth month in a row. It started in May with a reading of 51.3 from 53.9 in April and eventually dipped to 39.9 in June. It has been in the contraction region defined by the “50” threshold since June. In August, the reading came in at 43.4 from 40.1 in July.The PMI data showed that the pace of the reduction remained marked, suggesting a moderation in manufacturing output and broadly stagnant gross domestic product (GDP).This could be attributed to the lack of demand due to poor customer and consumer confidence, shortages of inputs causing companies to reduce production and holding back projects while new export orders did not pick up as Covid-19 cases also rose in key external markets.And there was a renewed drop in employment while input cost climbed for the 15th consecutive month in August due to rising prices for raw materials and logistics.This severe impact from MCO 3.0 should result in a slight contraction in third-quarter GDP as the country will be still reeling from lockdowns and the dissipating base effect.Overall, the economy grew at 7.1% y-o-y in the first half of 2021 from a decline of 8.4% y-o-y during the first half of 2020.The near-term economic outlook remains tilted to the downside amid uncertainties which include a risk of slower recovery should there be a delay in reopening the economy on account of a delayed resolution of the pandemic, outbreaks of new viral variants both internally and externally, prolonged tight containment measures with phase four of the National Recovery Plan starting in 2022, policy uncertainty and a slower recovery in the labour market.On that note, the full-year economic growth for 2021 would likely hover between 3% and 3.5%. And the economic outlook for 2022 should be more promising supported by the reopening of most economic sectors and the positive spillovers from continued improvement in external demand.The overnight policy rate (OPR), which is at a historical low of 1.75%, is expected to stay for the rest of the year. The current monetary settings are sufficiently accommodative to support growth.Lowering the OPR will likely result in banks becoming more cautious in lending, more so following the announcement of a repayment moratorium.For FX enquiries, please contact: ambank-fx-research@ambankgroup.com.

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,,AirAsia X recapitalisation discussions progressing well,"KUALA LUMPUR: AirAsia X Bhd (AAX) has made “substantial progress” in months-long talks with creditors as it aims to convene meetings with them to vote on a restructuring scheme by the end of October, its chief executive said.CEO Benyamin Ismail told Reuters in a telephone interview that negotiations and discussions with lessors, planemaker Airbus SE and service providers have progressed, but declined to detail what had been agreed.The airline, an affiliate of AirAsia Group, has also been talking to potential investors for its recapitalisation, and hopes to complete discussions by the end of the year.“We plan to raise funding in December and get that completed as soon as possible. We’re talking to everybody, we’ll get more colour towards the year-end,” Benyamin said, declining to reveal details about the potential investors but adding that there were more than a handful of them.Benyamin said talks with creditors are in the final stages and all have indicated they want to see the airline proceed with its restructuring.“We’re quite confident that we’ll get this through. The main commercial terms are already out of the way,” he said, referring to negotiations with lessors. There were no objections to a proposal to move engine maker Rolls-Royce Group into the same classification as most other creditors, he added.In a court document filed on Monday, AAX said negotiations are still afoot but “various letters of undertaking have been secured” from creditors.Many lessors have already struck other agreements with South-East Asia airlines to take back planes early or reduce rates, at least temporarily, to help them survive the plunge in air travel caused by coronavirus pandemic.“Drafts of the lock up agreements and term sheets were sent to the lessors on May 18. The lessors are presently in the process of reviewing them,” AAX said.The airline told the court that it has received signed letters of undertaking from three large creditors to support and vote for the scheme, namely Honeywell International, Bridgestone Aircraft Tire Company and Sky High I Leasing Company.AAX proposed last October to restructure RM64.15bil (US$15.4bil) of debt, a plan that drew objections from more than a dozen of creditors, many of whom are lessors.Airbus, the airline’s biggest creditor, filed an affidavit in December saying it stands to lose more than US$5bil (RM21bil) worth of orders if the scheme goes through. It declined to comment on the restructuring process.This week, the court granted AAX an extension to hold its creditors meetings by March next year, when a restraining order preventing creditors from filing fresh lawsuits against the airline expires too. — Reuters"
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,,Astro customers in for more content treat,"KUALA LUMPUR: With Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd bringing in more channels and streamers from Hollywood giants, the group’s content cost-to-TV revenue is likely to remain between 34% to 37%.There has been changes in Astro Malaysia’s channel lineup and also an addition of 15 subscription-based video-on-demand services expected by the end of financial year ending Jan 31, 2023.CGS-CIMB Research said Astro Malaysia has been getting more than it bargained for from the Hollywood studios over the year as its content cost has been stable since its re-listing in October 2012.“It is the international media giants that have more to lose if piracy upends their streaming gambit in Asia.“The video streaming market surfeit and subscriber fatigue are slowing down their growth in the United States, yet they continue to be mounted by high production costs to satisfy subscribers’ demand for content.“With the streaming integration and international media giants’ backing against piracy, we are hopeful that an earnings resurgence is in sight,” added the research house.Astro Malaysia is bringing in 13 new television channels to replace 11 channels owned by The Walt Disney Co, which will go off-air by end of this month.Replacing these channels is part of the media giant’s effort to reduce its exposure to linear broadcasting in international markets.According to CGS-CIMB Research, this is proof to the global media corporations depending on Astro Malaysia to get their direct-to-customer projects to work.As such, the research house is keeping an “add” call on Astro Malaysia with a target price of RM1.51.Currently, Astro Malaysia is trading at a 74.9% discount to the global pay-TV and streaming players’ weighted average enterprise value and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of 23.1 times for calendar year 2021 forecast.The research house believes that Astro Malaysia has decided to “replenish its channel count rather than taking this as an opportunity to cut its content costs further” because of its viewers that like to watch whatever is on television compared to choosing on what to watch."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,ZUNAIRA SAIEED,Bridging the financial literacy gap,"MANAGING the health of your finances has become more imperative as the pandemic continues to have an impact on the earnings of many Malaysians.With many facing financial difficulties, spending responsibly is becoming a new normal.Educating the younger generation with financial literacy before they enter the workforce is becoming more important.Even prior to the pandemic, many youths in Malaysia have not shown strong financial discipline. Three years ago, Bank Negara stated that 47% of Malaysian youth had high credit card debt.A global survey by Standard Chartered last year revealed that 74% of millennials in Malaysia found managing their money more difficult since the start of the pandemic.However, the survey showed that around 28% of millennials have started using a money management or budgeting app since the pandemic began, while another 62% plan to do so in the next three years, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.To help solve these issues, Kiplepay Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of tech firm Green Packet Bhd, recently rolled out the Kiplepay prepaid visa card tied to an e-wallet.Targeting university students, the payment card with money preloaded linked to an e-wallet would soon allow users to track their spending and control their expenses.According to Kiplepay acting chief executive officer Ricky Lew, the new features would enable better financial literacy and financial management among the youth from an early age.“Students would be able to view their weekly top spending in their e-wallet, and can even key in their savings goals. The card will also motivate students with incentives such as cashback to help them achieve their goals,” he tells StarBizWeek.He explains that learning good financial management skills at a young age is not a life skill taught in schools in the country compared to the United States which has included financial literacy as part of their syllabus.“We will be developing even more financial management solutions for these young students to help them be better at managing money,” notes Lew.It is important to note that no transaction fee is charged except for the 1% transaction charged for overseas spending.There are various prepaid cards in the market including AirAsia’s BigPay, Merchantrade Money Visa prepaid card, GoPayz-MAIPk, MRCA Visa prepaid card, eGen Visa prepaid card targeting different segments of the population.For Kiplepay’s Visa prepaid card, Lew says the newly launched service is one of the first e-wallets with a Visa card in the country targeting students.“We will be introducing more specific student services and propositions in the near future – stay tuned” points out Lew.Given its partnership with Visa, students will be able to perform cashless transactions with Visa’s 71 million merchants in over 200 countries.Last month, Kiplepay teamed up with Visa to introduce this first of its kind prepaid card- Kiple Visa prepaid card.It is noteworthy that in countries such as Singapore, these prepaid Visa card models have become popular among the youth.Similar to Kiplepay, the prepaid visa card brand Canvas in the island republic has acted as a teaching tool for the youth to learn how to prioritise allotted pocket money prudently.Meanwhile, Kiplepay has also expanded its payment and e-wallet solution, with a prepaid card for enterprises – the Kiple White Label prepaid card – a solution for businesses looking to create their own e-wallets with payment solutions within a quick four month’s time frame.Lew says the prepaid card for enterprises would allow companies to disburse salaries into the e-wallet with a spending Visa card.“The card will allow employees to manage and control their funds from one location without having to visit a bank and open up a bank account, which can also be a lengthy process,” he adds.In light of the new normal of different operating hours of banks amid the pandemic, Lew says the prepaid card is a more accessible choice for businesses to manage and track their employees salaries and expenses.“Today, foreign and gig workers are left behind in the cashless race as it is challenging for them to open new bank account to receive salaries.“This card linked to the e-wallet will make it more convenient for employers to ensure each employee receives the necessary funds safely,” he explains.In the last two years, Kiplepay has collaborated with state governments to disburse welfare funds to over 50,000 families through its Kiple-enabled Aid Distribution prepaid cards.The Kiple platform also allowed the government to track where and how the welfare funds were spent.The recently launched Kiplepay Visa prepaid card also allows cash withdrawals at bank ATMs, though at a fee of RM2 per withdrawal, which is the same fee other non-bank issued prepaid cards charge.Nonetheless, Lew says the prepaid card’s objective is not to perform as an ATM card but to be used for cashless transactions amid the acceleration in adoption of digital solutions.Since the launch last month, Lew says the company has received around 2,000 sign-ups for the prepaid card.Within a year, he expects to have about 1.5 million customers using the cards.Undoubtedly, Kiplepay Visa prepaid cards with the upcoming features of financial planning would help upskill the youth in financial literacy.“It is important to know where you spend and the kind of expenses you have. This kind of tool will help students to determine the essential items in their budget and have a better control on spending money that will tide us through this crisis.“On a bigger picture, this would help in the digitalisation of financial information on an e-wallet,” adds Yap, who is the founder and managing director of Whitman Independent Advisors Sdn Bhd."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,,Big sales jump for EcoWorld Malaysia in Q3,"KUALA LUMPUR: EcoWorld Development Group Bhd (EcoWorld Malaysia) reported robust sales growth in the third quarter ended July 31 (Q3’21), boosted by its success in converting digital leads into purchases during the MCO lockdown period.EcoWorld Malaysia recorded RM2.873bil sales in Q3’21 and by Aug 31, sales had reached RM3.11bil.Sales increased by more than RM1bil since Q2’21 enabling the group to surpass its full year target for FY’2021 of RM2.875bil.President and CEO Datuk Chang Khim Wah attributed the sales outperformance to “agility in pursuing on-line leads aggressively.”He cited the effectiveness of the group’s digitalisation initiatives (from frontline to backroom processes) which enabled systematic follow-through with potential customers and conversion of leads into sales online.But despite the sales jump, the group’s results were impacted by the government imposed lockdown in June and July.Revenue during the third quarter (Q3’21) declined to RM449mil from RM478mil a year ago. Net profit slipped to RM35.2mil compared with RM35.8mil previously.Chang expects construction work to pick up pace as the economy reopens.“Now that 100% of our staff who are medically eligible for vaccination and more than 80% of site workers are fully vaccinated, all of EcoWorld Malaysia’s construction sites are able to operate at full capacity, which will enable us to catch up on work progress,” he said.“We have also been permitted to reopen our sales galleries, and are therefore able to welcome customers to visit us once again to personally view our projects and properties, which is still an important step in the buying process for many,” he added.“This will enable EcoWorld Malaysia to proceed with our plans for the launch of several new phases before the end of the year to build up a strong pipeline of sales for the upcoming year,” he said.Adding overseas sales during the first ten-month up until Aug 31, the total group-wide sales has breached the RM4bil mark.EcoWorld International Bhd reported RM338mil sales in Q3’21, and a further RM81mil in August 2021.This lifted its year-to-date sales to RM1.04bil, plus reserves of RM285mil that added to RM1.33bil as of end of August.EcoWorld Group’s share of future revenue as at Aug 31 remained high at RM4.1bil – RM3.72bil contributed by its Malaysian projects whilst EcoWorld Malaysia’s attributable share of EcoWorld International’s future revenue stands at RM386mil."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,,"Short Position - Johor Corp restructuring, Top Glove, digitil isation","Johor Corp restructuringJOHOR Corp Bhd is said to be in the midst of a full-scale restructuring. It would be a timely and potentially necessary move for the state investment arm of Johor.As StarBizWeek has highlighted this week, large corporations are being nudged to reorganise themselves in light of the economic distress brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. It is a wake-up call for organisations to future-proof themselves and address environmental, governance and sustainability issues.In JCorp’s case, the group has a massive RM23bil worth of assets but also has RM14bil in liabilities. JCorp has a diverse set of assets, in industries such as plantations, hospitals, fast food chains, property development and real estate development trusts.It also has stakes in a number of listed companies in other industries. In the past, there had been concerns that JCorp had struggled to repay some of its debt and as a holding company, it was one that could boast of owning prized assets but which had not been able to receive sufficient cash returns from its investments.Among the significant corporate exercises that JCorp had been mulling to do include the re-listing of QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd, which has more than 1,300 KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in Malaysia and the region.First talk of its listing was in 2019 prior to the pandemic. It is left to be seen how much its profit numbers have been hit in the last two years and if it can secure a decent valuation going to market now.Earlier in the year, there were reports that JCorp was looking to do a corporate exercise involving KPJ Healthcare Bhd, where it owns 38%. The hospital group runs more than 28 specialist hospitals in Malaysia and also has investments in hospitals in Indonesia, Bangkok and Bangladesh as well as in a retirement resort in Australia.Bloomberg had reported that JCorp was looking bringing in an investor with experience in the sector or a merger with another hospital operator. While there are no updates on the QSR listing or the KPJ merger and acquisition deal, JCorp will be closely watched as indications are that it is beginning its restructuring journey.Just this week JCorp increased its stake in Damansara Holdings Bhd after buying a 49.57% stake in the company for RM78.91mil. JCorp had in fact sold that same stake in the company to a businessman in 2014, only to this week buy it back at the same price. It is left to be seen what JCorp does now with the facilities and project management firm.Reversing a boomTHE suspense of Top Glove Corp Bhd’s financial results was not like what it was before when investors were wondering what the impact of the start of the pandemic was on the rubber glove industry.This time, investors were greeted with a more realistic set of financial results after understanding the shutdowns and the tapering prices of rubber gloves have had on the entire rubber glove industry.Top Glove’s financial results were not what analysts were expecting. The fourth-quarter numbers showed a big contraction that was brought about by the shutdown, falling demand and declining prices.Investors have known about the decline in average selling prices of rubber gloves and that was to be expected. Nothing goes up forever in prices. The fall in demand was surprising, possibly execrated by the US import ban, which now has been lifted.But the steep drop in profitability has to be looked from a number of different perspectives. Firstly, the entire dynamics of the industry will change in the quarters ahead. Expect average selling prices to ease ahead and demand too would follow suit as vaccination rates worldwide rises.Stockpiling will no longer be as prevalent as before, which is a factor that also contributed to the spike in selling prices.Then there is the impact on the broader industry. What transpired during the boom times was a rush by new entrants into the market. That also added to the capacity the industry has that was built up by not only capacity expansion by existing players but also companies that have ventured into the business in search of a profit bump.The next few quarters will be interesting to watch in terms of what will be the knock-on effects within the industry, domestically and abroad.The one obvious thing is that the rubber glove companies will be making more money than before the pandemic started and maybe there will be a re-rating to recognise that in the time ahead.Going its own wayFOR the longest time it was always believed that the private sector knows best. That remains largely true but it also depends on the complexity of the situation.And when the business involves utilising government services, then it might make sense why the government might want to get into that act itself rather than leave the profit from a seemingly straightforward business today in the hands of the private sector.The government has spoken about digitalising its services, and after a tug-of-war and a pandemic, the options are really in the favour of getting things done.The government, through the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), is inviting public feedback on the development of a National Mobile Application or super app.It said the app would potentially allow the public to pay bills, settle traffic summonses, renew driving licences and road tax, book a doctor’s appointment, access e-healthcare services, and register births and marriages online, among others.The success and willingness of the public to adapt to the MySejahtera app will mean that there should be acceptance for a centralised method of utilising digiatlisation to conduct government services. And it does not need to role of the private sector to grant the public access to a suite of services digitally."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,TAN THIAM HOCK,SMEs in dire need of assistance,"ON the eve of Malaysia Day, I was delighted to share a few drinks and cigars with my two elderly sifus, Peter Khoo and TK Teo. Khoo, an accounting and tax practitioner and Teo, an experienced banker and corporate personality, have such great stories to tell with much wisdom imparted from their past experiences.But our discussion turned sombre when I asked them how bad has this pandemic-driven recession affected Malaysian SMEs, as compared with other recessions since 1987.Both say that the SMEs are facing the toughest challenges ever seen before.Khoo reckons some 30% of Malaysian SMEs have closed down in the last 18 months. Teo feels that more SMEs will close down come January 2022 when the bank moratorium ends.My hairstylist who used to have a saloon in Kota Damansara told me that more than half of the 40 over hair salons in his area have closed down in the last 18 months. Many shopping malls across the country have seen retail and F&B stores close. Not forgetting the closures of so many hotels and all tourism businesses. The list is endless. The damage is extensive.The many lockdowns and strict SOPs have ruined many businesses. As the losses mounted, cash flow depleted super fast, defaults on bank loans reprieved by two moratoriums, savings are all used up and there is no light at the end of the tunnel for any recovery in business. Until now.Luckily for Malaysia, our vaccination programme has been accelerated and in three weeks, 90% of our adult population would be fully vaccinated. The adult population is the working population. This has enabled the government to open up the economy gradually and come October, hopefully all sectors will be reopened and we hope that it includes allowing interstate travelling.How can the government help the SMEs? I had asked Teo this question before we left for home.The following day, Teo asked if I remembered about the Export Credit Refinancing (ECR) scheme which was introduced by the government after the 1987 major recession.Of course I remembered. In the late 1980s, I was managing a rubber glove factory and had used the ECR facilities to the maximum. Upon receiving a purchase order (PO) from my customers, I could utilise up to 80% of the PO value to issue letters of credit to my latex supplier, order packaging materials and pay for the gas bills.Upon completion of the order, the money received is first paid to the bank and the balance money is used to pay salaries. Manufacturers could borrow upfront based on a firm order so that production could proceed.Financing cost was at 4% compared to the standard 8%-10% commercial rate of borrowing. It was a Bank Negara initiative, all ECR loans and facilities extended by commercial banks were guaranteed by Credit Guarantee Corporation (CGC), owned by Bank Negara and Malaysian banks.Teo explains more: “As we know, SMEs are the worst hit sector during this pandemic. Most of them have no more working capital even if there is new demand for their products or services.“Most of their existing loans have now turned into non-performing loans (NPL). So they have little chance of getting banks to extend additional facilities to them. Therefore, Bank Negara can introduce a similar funding scheme that can cater to SMEs that have contracts or orders in hand, but need fresh working capital.“These funds can be guaranteed by CGC and also with the condition that part of the new business proceeds must be used to settle the existing NPL.”Teo’s idea is practical and offers an amicable solution to all parties.SMEs will get fresh loans and cash flow to proceed with their operations to fulfil orders. Banks are able to reduce the NPL impact without taking on more risks.The government controls a quantitative easing measure that is directed at productive activities that contributes towards faster growth of our gross domestic product.I would like to expand on Teo’s idea and suggest the following:> Set up a RM100bil SME revival fund. Allocate an amount to the banks based on their respective loan size to the SME sector. CGC can guarantee up to 80% of the new loans extended by the banks to existing SME customers.> Set the interest charged for these loans to not more than 3%. With overnight policy rate at 1.75%, there are sufficient margins for the banks to implement this scheme profitably.> For export business, reintroduce the ECR scheme. For domestic business with orders or contracts in hand, a similar domestic credit refinancing (DCR) scheme can be implemented.The total amount of financing should be about two to three months of rolling future sales. Assuming it makes RM500,000 monthly sales, based on 80% financing, a RM1.2mil DCR facility would be sufficient.> For businesses that depend on future orders like F&B and services, a one-off revival loan can be implemented. Assuming the F&B outlet can generate RM100,000 monthly sales, then an upfront RM100,000 loan repayable over three years can be implemented. This RM100,000 loan will be sufficient to kick-start the business.Bank Negara should consult the various trade associations and banks to ascertain their needs before designing the SOP’s for the SME revival fund.In addition, Bank Negara should open a channel for the unrepresented SMEs to start a dialogue to understand their needs.The ECR and DCR schemes can be implemented quickly and should be implemented before the moratorium expires by the end of this year.With the economy opening up, let us hope that our government will not resort to further lockdowns because the country will plunge into an economic abyss and never recover. We also need the government to ensure proper public health policies go hand in hand with economic activities.The Health Minister has started the vaccination of children from the ages of 12-17 years, but the speed of vaccination will depend on the supply of Pfizer vaccines, which is again delayed.The Education Minister has wisely delayed the starting of the school term and correctly said it should coincide with the vaccination progress of children.Some countries like Singapore have started booster shots of vaccines for the elderly and for cancer patients so I am sure our Health Minister will look into this urgent matter, again subject to the delivery of vaccines.Our Senior Minister for Security has announced that the 181 SOPs will be reduced to just 10 ‘simple to understand’ SOPs.The whole nation will rejoice when the new SOPs are announced. It should be based on vaccination status, public health considerations of wearing masks, sanitisation, social distancing and crowd control.Further considerations will be on self testing, home quarantines and contact tracing. Generalise the instructions for businesses and citizens to follow and make SOPs simple so that it will not be misinterpreted by local enforcement officers.Businesses should not be subjected to International Trade and Industry Ministry approvals anymore.We should not burden the police with applications for interstate travels. The civil service must revert back to pre-Covid efficiency levels. It is unproductive to have to make a booking online for an appointment to submit a document and frustrating to see all slots have been fully booked for the next two weeks.What used to be a simple task of going to a public service department, collect a waiting number and conducting a simple transaction on the same day, must resume immediately.I have never seen any government departments refusing to collect taxes or stamp duties before until this pandemic.The land office is closed, the public have not been able to get road tax since March and the Inland Revenue Department is refusing to collect cheque payments at their counters. Funnily enough, our Finance Minister was lamenting about the low collection of tax revenue.Lastly, the plantation and the manufacturing sectors are screaming for foreign workers to be allowed entry.Since the pandemic started, we have had net outflow of foreign workers returning home upon completion of their contracts as no inflows are allowed. Working mothers are also in search of domestic helpers since their previous helpers have left for home.With the economy opening up quickly, we need to allow entry of new foreign workers and domestic helpers. It is a major revenue for the Home Ministry as workers levy and fees run into hundreds of million a year.Managing this recovery will require all ministries and our civil service to work together, coordinate better and communicate with one voice. And do listen carefully to the voice of desperate SMEs and to the voice of frustrated citizens as GE15 is only two years away.Tan Thiam Hock is an entrepreneur.

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,PANKAJ C. KUMAR,The 18th entry,"SIX months ago, in a column entitled “Early signs of weakness in commercial real estate” dated March 6, a review was carried out among listed Malaysian Real Estate Investment Trusts (M-REITs) in terms of the market value of their properties, and to see the impact of the pandemic on the valuation of their properties.In summary, based on the reported data by M-REITS with the financial year-end of December 2020, there are early signs of weakness among commercial properties, but not necessarily across the board.Even within the office, retail, or hospitality segment, M-REITs seem to be resilient enough to withstand the economic headwinds.A quick check with M-REITs that had financial year-end outside the December period saw some material movements, but these assets were mainly confined to retail and hospitality REITs.Among them was a RM19.1mil or 5.1% drop in The Summit Subang, USJ’s market value, owned by AmFIRST REIT, which stood at RM357.4mil against the carrying value of RM376.5mil.Other notable changes were seen in YTL Hospitality REIT’s (YTL REIT) assets, in particular their Australian and Japanese properties.According to YTL REIT, these assets saw an increase of RM132.3mil and RM30mil in the market value of the properties, representing an increase of 7.2% and 6% respectively. Even YTL REIT’s Malaysian hotel assets saw an improvement in value with a modest increase of RM24mil or 1.1%.Hence, despite the lockdowns and economic challenges faced by M-REITs, we have only seen isolated cases where the value of commercial properties has declined and to the contrary, for YTL REITs, the value of its assets, even for those that are located in Malaysia, rose.M-REITs welcomes IGB Commercial REITTo be listed on Monday, IGB Commercial REIT (IGBCR) is coming to the market at a time when the real estate market is facing tough times.Recent reports have suggested that the office sub-sector is facing some form of glut, not only driven by the pandemic and business closures or scale down of operations, especially with the culture of working from home, but also due to the sheer size of the incoming office supply.In fact, the recently released data from the National Property Information Centre (Napic) for the the first half of 2021 showed occupancy rate of purpose-built office (private) in Kuala Lumpur fell to 72.2%, down 3.6 percentage points from the first half of 2020 rate of 75.8%.Data also showed that some 70 office buildings within Kuala Lumpur or approximately 17.1% of all buildings have a vacancy rate in excess of 50%.A year ago, this figure was 63 buildings or 15.7% of the total number of buildings. For the record, Kuala Lumpur alone has some 2.54 million square meters of available space and that represents 50.1% of Malaysia’s total vacancy of 5.07 million square meters as at end of the first half of 2021. Although no shares were offered to the public, the initial public offering (IPO) involved a restricted offer for sale (ROFS) to IGB shareholders on the basis of two IGBCR for every five IGB shares held at an offer price of RM1 per unit and a distribution-in-specie of three IGBCR for every two ROFS subscribed.In effect, the shareholders of IGB have subscribed to IGBCR units at an effective price of RM0.40 per unit for the five IGBCR that they obtained via the ROFS and the distribution-in-specie.The ROFS was undersubscribed by 21.3% or some 163.5 million units. Together with the original allocated institutional tranche of 130mil units, the unsubscribed ROFS of 163.5mil units too were also sold to institutions at a final fixed price of RM0.71 per unit. Hence, based on the final numbers, the institutional tranche is approximately 12.7% of the total 2,307.3mil units to be listed on Monday while subscribers of the ROFS will hold approximately 26.3% of the total issued units, which comprise of related, non-related, and minority shareholders.The shareholders who have subscribed to the ROFS are now sitting on some paper losses due to a drop in the share price of IGB shares itself. Based on IGB’s last Wednesday’s closing market price of RM1.92 and the cum-price of RM2.84, an IGB shareholder holding five shares of the company before the ex-date for the entitlement to the ROFS has suffered a loss of RM0.92 per IGB share. As in theory, they have a gain of RM0.31 per IGBCR (the difference between the effective cost of 40 sen per unit against the reference price of 71 sen), IGB shareholders are sitting on a paper loss of 61 sen per IGB share held before the ex-date.IGBCR will be the 18th M-REITs to be listed on the market but in terms of size, with a market capitalisation of RM1.64bil, based on the institutional offer price of 71 sen, it will be the sixth largest among all the M-REITs. However, in terms of exposure to the office sub-sector, IGBCR will emerge as the largest office REIT with a market value that is almost equivalent to UOA Reits and Sentral REITs combined. As a percentage of the Bursa Malaysia REIT index, IGBCR will emerge with a 4.21% weighting on the index.IGBCR comprises 10 highly valuable office buildings which were injected into the REITs at a combined value of RM3.16bil. This was satisfied via the issuance of the current units in circulation, which is 2,307.5mil units at an issue price of RM1 per share and cash of RM853.2mil to the vendors. The cash portion is funded via borrowings whereby IGBCR has raised RM850mil via a medium term note programme. In essence, the market value of the company of RM1.64bil is 51.8% of the value of the ten assets combined valuation and a 29% discount to the net asset value (NAV) of the company.The lukewarm response to IGBCR’s IPO, especially via the ROFS perhaps is a reflection of the soft market conditions. In fact, IGBCR too revealed that its current occupancy rate is at about 76.3%. When compared with its nearest rivals, Sentral REITs and UOA REITs have a much better occupancy rate of 93% and 88% respectively as at end of 2020.In terms of prospects, IGBCR did provide some guidance for this year, with an estimated distribution per unit of 3.9 sen per share. This translates to a yield of 5.5% based on the reference price of RM0.71 per share. As can be seen from the table, when compared with UOA REITs and Sentral REITs, IGBCR looks to be attractively priced on a P/NAV basis but not on a dividend yield basis as both the former have a weighted average yield that is at least 2.5 percentage points higher than IGBCR. This could be a reflection of a lower occupancy rate at IGBCR’s properties.Valuation matrix of office REITs and IGB REITsAs IGB has gained a reputable name in the management of its assets, judging by the premium IGB REITs itself commands, which at 1.58x P/NAV and just 4.1% in terms of yield, it may not come as a surprise that IGBCR too may attract investors interest due to its premium market position and value that it brings to investors.

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,YVONNE TAN,Too early to predict,"WHILE banking stocks have so far acted negatively to the Finance Ministry’s (MoF) instruction to get banks working on exempting interest payments for moratorium borrowers, observers say it is too early to predict the exact impact on banks.“We await the announced outcome and allow banks to distil the impact and/or provide some pushback,” CLSA banking analyst Peter Kong tells clients in a report.Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) analyst Chan Jit Hoong says he is making no change to his earnings forecasts for banks at the moment “till we gather more updates from banks.”It is understood that the banks themselves are awaiting more instructions from Bank Negara on the matter.On Tuesday, the MoF said in a statement that it had instructed banking institutions to quickly work on exemption of interest rate payments for recipients under the country’s moratorium programme.This will involve borrowers from the bottom 50% of all Malaysians as measured by income, for the October to December 2021 period.The moratorium – a temporary halt of loan payments by bank borrowers – is in place as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic which has caused many, especially from the lower-income groups, to not be able to service their regular loans because of factors like job losses and closure of businesses.While borrowers do not have to make payments on their loans under a moratorium period, the downside of it is that interest tends to accrue as a result of taking up the moratorium, and the borrower will have to bear this interest.“While we do not downplay the plight of those suffering, we believe interest waivers need to be selective, and see banks pushing back if this were not the case,” says CLSA’s Kong.“Details are scant, but modification losses may arise in this current form and we cannot rule out a potential knee-jerk reaction,” he adds.Banks have declined to comment on the matter at the moment.However, some have chosen to highlight the measures that they have been implementing in the current times.CIMB Group Holdings Bhd CEO Datuk Abdul Rahman Ahmad (pic) says the bank remains cautious in the second half of 2021, as it anticipates the global Covid-19 resurgence to bring about challenges such as stagnant loan growth, low interest rates, margin compression and modification losses.“We will continue to focus on helping our customers navigate the economic challenges caused by the pandemic,” he tells StarBizWeek.According to him, CIMB has offered various payment assistance programmes in three phases from 2020, and to date, it has helped around 480,000 customers through its opt-in programmes and about 1.2 million customers via the blanket moratorium offered in March 2020.“We recognise that providing repayment assistance in a fast-tracked and convenient manner is key.“We invested heavily on digitising this area in order to provide assistance in a seamless and digital manner.“And whilst I am aware there are still shortcomings and criticisms on banks, given the constraints of our working environment due to the mobility restrictions, I am pleased to say that CIMB took the lead in providing repayment assistance with our straight through digital processing platform, with a virtual 100% approval rate.”Abdul Rahman says beyond the repayment assistance, CIMB continues to provide support to communities in need and also to the national healthcare system.“In Malaysia, we recently announced our RM10mil aid commitment under our Komuniti Kita Covid-19 Relief project towards upgrading hospitals and medical facilities and food aid programmes in partnership with several NGOs,” he adds.CIMB is expecting provision for doubtful debts to remain elevated amid the ongoing pandemic.AMMB Holdings Bhd (AmBank) group CEO Datuk Sulaiman Mohd Tahir is expecting the same, taking a prudent stand on provisions.“We have taken an additional RM87mil of overlay in the first quarter of financial year ending March 31, 2022 (FY22), which is necessary at this juncture, with total overlay carried forward standing at RM833mil now,” he tells StarBizWeek.“Nevertheless, we are actually experiencing a reduction in impaired loans, (FY21 1.54%; FY20 1.73%) which again is a function of how we have managed the moratorium for our clientele.“Frankly, if not for the current moratorium, we would have seen a lot more non-performing loans.“The current structure also provides for those who are servicing their loans currently with the freedom and prospect of not backloading their loan payments,” says Sulaiman.He declined to comment on the recent instruction by the MoF.Meanwhile, in his report, HLIB’s Chan notes that MoF’s instruction to exempt three months of interest payments for the B50 segment under the loan moratorium is a negative development but unlikely to have material impact on banks.“However, forecasts are unchanged till we gather more updates from banks. In any case, we have rolled our valuations to FY22 and this is a one-off event. We reckon price weakness is an opportunity to accumulate.”According to Chan, the banking sector’s risk-reward profile continues to “skew to the upside” as Covid-19 woes will likely fizzle out in 2022 while the state of the economy and banking sector will “only get better” in time.“Furthermore, valuations are undemanding and there is ample liquidity in the market.”For large-sized banks, he likes Malayan Banking Bhd for its strong yield, and Public Bank Bhd for its resilient asset quality over CIMB."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,,KWAP’s journey with ESG investing,"IF it’s one thing that the Covid-19 pandemic has thought investors is that they need to be concerned about the survival of companies they invest in, when the latter are faced with unprecedented shocks.Local institutional fund Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) has been early to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria in its investment strategies. KWAP CEO Nik Amlizan Mohamed shares some of her thoughts about asset management, ESG adoption and the pandemic.StarBizWeek: How has the Covid-19 pandemic changed investment strategies?Nik Amlizan: The pandemic has exposed the fragility of concepts that we once may have viewed as concrete. It continues to show us the cracks in our businesses, particularly from an ESG perspective, while highlighting the importance of resilience and adaptability.Investor appetite and expectations have certainly shifted with accelerated demand for the adoption of ESG best practices as investors are increasingly integrating these factors into their decision-making processes.This could be considered a silver lining due to the Covid-19 pandemic, given that ESG will drive greater improvements for society as a whole and for corporations in their engagements with the communities in which they operate.A few salient benefits that corporations will need to move faster on would be reversing the degradation of the environment, improving social compliance and most certainly conducting business with more principles and governance.According to the International Institute of Sustainable Development, in 2018, global sustainable investments amounted to about US$30 trillion (RM125 trillion). By 2036, that number is expected to reach over US$150 trillion (RM625 trillion) signifying a 433% increase.MSCI data confirms that companies with high ESG performance relative to their sector peers have done well and have continued to attract capital even during the pandemic. Bursa Malaysia announced earlier this year that companies with better ESG practices were more resilient during the pandemic.How does ESG criteria impact investment decisions and portfolio construction at KWAP?At KWAP, ESG is a given and it is embedded in our DNA when it comes to investing. Eventually, we foresee a fully ESG-compliant portfolio. Hence, we had asked for improved compliance with ESG practices from our portfolio of companies.It is not just about the bottom line performance, it is about how businesses operate.Climate change, debt bondage and corporate fraud are just a few of the negative outcomes in relation to poor ESG practices. Companies must raise the bar on how they conduct their businesses.As a major investor with a portfolio of RM150bil in assets under management, KWAP must take the lead to ensure that the ESG journey is accelerated in the country. To do this, we are focused on active shareholder engagement.We look into sustainability, impact on the environment, workers’ rights, employee living conditions, adherence to international labour standards and much more. We are mindful that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to ESG compliance.For example, some of our neighbouring nations do not need to depend on foreign labour while we do to a certain extent. Dependency on foreign labour exposes these companies to the risk of unsavoury practices by foreign agents.As part of our engagement with our portfolio companies, we also emphasise the need for them to ensure good ESG practices across their supply chain, be it their suppliers or outsourcing partners.ESG is a journey and we will continue to see evolving expectations and new benchmarks set. What might have been acceptable ESG practices in 2020 might not be so now and what is acceptable right now may not be next year.What strategy should corporations impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic be thinking about as they restructure to stay afloat?A key consideration should be future-proofing their business. We are living through the devastating impact of the pandemic and it is not difficult to imagine how much more severe the impact of climate change will be on society and the global economy. Businesses that are not future proof will not be viewed favourably.Automation and digitalisation will have to be accelerated and this needs to be accompanied by specific improvements to efficiencies. This applies to any sector and any nature of business.It would be imprudent to presume that such key areas of change need not be pursued on the premise that the pandemic will fade away.Asset owners expect investee companies to address their financial risk, reputational risks as well as threats and opportunities.The Covid-19 pandemic will very likely be considered an endemic and this will come with its fair share of challenges.Hence, companies and sectors must strengthen processes and indeed have a mindset change on how they prepare to manage their businesses future-forward.What opportunities have become apparent in this crisis?Covid-19 also provides new opportunities. Clearly, new growth areas are opening up as a result of this pandemic such as renewable energy, low-carbon technologies, water, health, ageing population and sustainable agriculture.One of the areas we are also looking at is how businesses need to pivot in terms of strengthening their network in the value chain particularly if they are export-driven.As we have seen recently, there has been a pragmatic move by major global manufacturers to move their manufacturing hubs away from traditionally preferred geographical locations in order to be less dependent on one particular geographic area to support their supply needs.This provides opportunities for entrepreneurs. As a long-term investor, KWAP sees this upside potential especially for Malaysia to benefit from such adjustment.Has Covid-19 sharpened investors’ focus on sustainability, ESG factors and digitalisation?Our ESG journey started as early as 2009 and it was triggered by our focus that investing in companies with good ESG practices can contribute towards delivering sustainable risk-adjusted returns and therefore enhance shareholder’s value in the long run.This remains true, even in the post-Covid-19 world.In terms of digitalisation, for the last few years, we have been encouraging our investee companies to adopt digital solutions. Unfortunately, the take-up rate has not been quick enough.However, the pandemic has played a part in fast-tracking the adoption of digitalisation, arguably due to necessity as companies clamber to adjust to the new norm in order to continue their operations and remain competitive.As highlighted earlier, companies have no choice but to strengthen their infrastructure in terms of digitalisation and this must be executed in tandem with cultural changes for companies, given that staff will need to be engaged in a more conscious and considerate manner to ensure that staff are better prepared for this new age of conducting business.Will this focus on sustainability last?If there are any lessons that we need to take from this pandemic it is that we can never revert to the previous status quo.The focus on sustainability will only gain momentum.We will see more regulatory demands as governments strive to meet their sustainability goals including climate change-related goals, we also expect demands from consumers to increase and of course, investors will continue to focus on ESG compliance.Based on Bloomberg data released in July 2021, ESG assets are on track to exceed US$50 trillion (RM208.57 trillion) globally by 2025 compared to US$35 trillion (RM146 trillion) in 2020, US$30.6 trillion (RM127.65 trillion) in 2018 and US$22.8 trillion (RM95.11 trillion) in 2016.There is also an increasing number of asset owners and asset managers who have integrated ESG into their investment decision making by becoming to the United Nations Backed Principles of Responsible Investment (PRI).KWAP became a signatory to the UN-backed PRI in 2018.As of July 1, 2021, PRI assets under management stood at US$121.2 trillion (RM505.59 trillion) based on 3,404 investor signatories, representing an increase of US$17.9 trillion (RM74.67 trillion) from US$103.4 trillion (RM431.33 trillion) at the end of March 2020 (17% increase).This long-term formal commitment is a strong indication that sustainability is here to stay.The pandemic was a turning point for corporations locally and globally. We need to ensure that we do not regress to the past.KWAP is focused that there is a permanent shift to incorporate sustainability into our organisation’s DNA and become part of our culture."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,ZUNAIRA SAIEED,Positive signs for Top Glove,"KUALA LUMPUR: Despite a drop in Top Glove Corp Bhd’s net profit in the fourth quarter ended Aug 31 (Q4’21), the world’s largest glove maker is confident that the demand for gloves will continue to be strong on the return of its customer orders from Africa, Middle East, Vietnam, Thailand, China and the United States.Its managing director Datuk Lee Kim Meow said its customers’ orders from these countries are returning as average selling prices (ASPs) of gloves are currently trending lower.“These are some of the positive signs. Countries that were not active in purchasing gloves from last year and up till early this year are now coming back because it is affordable to buy gloves. They will continue to play their part to take-up the gloves,” he said during the the media and analyst briefing on its Q4’21 results.As such, Lee is enthused that the demand for gloves would continue to surge amid heightened concerns of new Covid-19 variants.In Q4’21, Top Glove saw a pick-up in sales volume in Africa and Middle East of 15% and 38% respectively, compared to the Q3’21.For the full financial year ended Aug 31, 2021 (FY’21), the glovemaker saw a rise in sales volume from Latin America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Asia excluding Japan of 17%, 8%, 15% and 12% respectively compared to a year ago.Following the lifting of the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) ban, Lee said Top Glove is expected to see a boost in sales volume in the coming quarters with the resumption of sales to the US market.It is important to note that its sales to the US accounted for 15% of the group’s total sales in FY’21.He pointed out that exports to the US is expected to be fully normalised by December and shipments would resume as early as end of this month.“We are back in business and have goods that are ready. We are confident that we will retain our customers in the US and also attract new customers.“Our customers know that we have the capacity and capability. They know one of the ways to grow bigger in their industry is to have a strong supplier like Top Glove,” Lee said.Top Glove’s disposable gloves are now admissible at all US ports of entry effective Sept 10.After getting the nod to resume selling its glove products to the US, AmInvestment Bank Research, in its report said Top Glove could see a boost in its earnings.“This is a positive development as it indicates that environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns have been alleviated,” it said.The glove maker posted a historic net profit of RM7.87bil for the FY’21 from RM1.75bil a year ago.However, its Q4’21 earnings fell to RM607.94mil compared to RM1.17bil a year ago amid the very challenging operating environment.The group’s revenue fell 32% to RM2.12bil in the quarter from RM3.11bil a year ago.As at Aug 31, Top Glove’s net cash position remained healthy at RM2.05bil.The group declared a total dividend of 65.1 sen per share, amounting to RM5.21bil for FY’21 which represents a 452% increase from the full year dividend 11.8 sen per share in FY’20.Besides that, Top Glove said it would renew its listing application to push ahead with its plans to raise US$1bil (RM4.17bil) in Hong Kong.The group has been seeking a dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since last year, but the deal was put on hold following the import ban from US authorities."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,News,,PM: Grant for SMEs to be given out from next week,"PETALING JAYA: The government will channel RM500mil of assistance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) through the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) 4.0 beginning Sept 21, says Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.“With this aid, it is hoped that small businesses such as food stalls, barbers, workshops and cake shops will be able to reduce their burden and help in their cash flow,” he said.Each payment of RM500 will be given out in September and November.The Prime Minister said the grant, which is a component of the Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih), will benefit more than one million recipients.In a statement yesterday, he said the aid would be transferred directly into bank accounts registered with the GKP system.The status of the GKP 4.0 can be checked at gkp.hasil.gov.my.So far, he said RM6.08bil had been channelled to SMEs under the GKP since the pandemic began.“I hope this aid will be able to revive the SME sector, which is the engine of economic growth for the Malaysian family.”The government, he said, would give priority to industry players who were among those most affected during the pandemic.Meanwhile, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said the status of those who applied and then appealed for the Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat (BPR) can be checked at bpr.hasil.gov.my starting today.This will involve almost 200,000 BPR recipients with an estimated allocation of RM240mil, said Tengku Zafrul, adding that the payments would be credited at the end of this month into accounts registered with the BPR.He said in a statement the payout would also be given to recipients of the third phase of the BPR.Tengku Zafrul said the government had updated the data of the B40 group eligible to receive the BPR after their appeals were submitted from June 15 to June 30.The appeals were verified by the Inland Revenue Board to ensure that the aid would benefit those who qualified for it.“The government hopes that this cash assistance totalling RM17.1bil until the end of the year can assist Malaysian families in managing their expenses,” he said."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,NG ZHU HANN,Will Evergrande remain ever grand?,"THERE is a common joke in China’s real estate fraternity. When the real estate market is bad, buyers will complain about everything during the property handover. But during a bull market, if you handover a unit without a front door, they would still gladly take possession.That is the nature of the real estate industry. It is one of the most important sectors in the economy in most parts of the world, not only from an economic standpoint but also from a societal angle.Housing for the masses has always been a thorny issue that governments of the day are required to address.A good government is one that is deemed to have a policy which balances the people’s housing needs versus the vibrancy of the real estate market. This is because real estate functions not only as an asset class but it also serves a greater humanitarian need, a roof over one’s head.Traditionally, developing economies around the world have higher gross domestic product (GDP) growth percentage in comparison to developed nations as real estate and construction forms a huge weightage in its contribution towards the GDP of a country.The real estate sector creates far reaching spillover effects where a boom in this single industry results in growth for other sectors along the value chain such as building materials, steel, furniture, logistics and countless others.However, as a country’s economy transits from developing to developed, one would notice a gradual slowdown in the pace of its real estate projects.Indeed, real estate, infrastructure and construction is the most direct way in which fiscal stimulus can inject life into the economy but it is never the most sustainable.This is primarily because it is a debt driven sector where developers, contractors and end consumers rely on loans to fuel its demand. Hence, debts will pile up substantially over time, especially if unregulated.This brings me to the most pressing issue in the real estate world today; China’s Evergrande Group’s (Evergrande) potential collapse. Evergrande is the second largest real estate developer in China by sales revenue. Another interesting “title” it helms would be the world’s most indebted company.Evergrande has liabilities amounting to an estimated US$300bil (RM1.26 trillion) from years of aggressive expansion.To put it into perspective, Malaysia’s total debt as of December 2020 stood at RM1.26 trillion. Imagine a company’s liabilities is equivalent to our nation. Now what if it defaults on its debt obligations and goes under? Until today, China has yet to go through any major recession unlike other economies around the world. Many market commentators are increasingly worried that the potential default by Evergrande would pose a systemic risk to the economy of China.Some are even saying that Evergrande may potentially be China’s version of Lehman Brothers. Although I do not think so, there are flashing red signals.At present, Evergrande has 10 active offshore bonds issued on the market. To get a gauge on its precarious state, the company’s bond with the soonest maturity on March 23, 2022 has fallen a whopping 70% to 30 US cents as of Sept 14, 2021.For the bond furthest from maturity on June 28 2025, it has fallen 67% to 27.46 US cents. This essentially means the bond market is pricing a default. The table shows five of the largest Evergrande bond issuance in size and its performance.When the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protest (also known as Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement) erupted, many with the government of the day blamed the Hong Kong youths as unpatriotic, unappreciative and hateful.While not highlighted sufficiently, there were actually underlying economic factors which spurred the protest.The key one being exorbitant housing prices which made it out of reach for many youths. Unlike Singapore, the affordable housing schemes in Hong Kong is far from comprehensive due to the expensive land cost which is part of a key revenue stream for the Hong Kong government.During the protest around September, 2019, I was in Hong Kong for a business meeting. I remembered my friend’s 630 sq ft private condominium unit in Sai Kung (which is near the port and surrounded by fishing villages), cost HK$11mil (RM5.9mil).That is equivalent to an unfathomable RM9,400 per sq ft. In my view, most youths would never be able to own a home at such pricing.Real estate is often described as old economy and many of the older generation built their wealth from real estate during the booming economic years.In fact, many of the “old money” of the world today have some ties to real estate one way or another. After all, it is an asset class that hedges well against inflation and preserves the value of wealth or money rather effectively.Yet, whether real estate should be economic driver of a country is debatable.Whenever I assess the real estate market, a respectable figure that comes to my mind would be Tan Sri Chew Chee Kin, the long time president of Sunway Group and trusted general of Tan Sri Jeffrey Cheah.Back in 2015, I was a group strategy manager with the organisation and had the opportunity to sit in some of the leadership meetings.I remembered his wise words to the senior management at the time. He said “the golden age of real estate may likely come to an end with the supply flooding the market, the company needs to take note of this. Unless one can find a way to build houses like how Toyota build their cars, otherwise it is hard to maintain a dominant position in a fragmented market.Although we are witnessing real estate companies venturing globally to foreign markets, at the end of the day, real estate is still a localised industry. It is important to remember why HSBC did well and it has to do with its motto; “The World’s Local Bank.”Years later, I met Chew again during a friendly corporate delegation visit. At the time, several of the largest real estate developers in China were venturing into Malaysia in a big way.I will never forget what Chew said in eloquent Mandarin as an ice-breaker during the visit, “Sharks may rule the ocean, but not freshwater river. That said, I look forward to learning from you.”The pandemic exposed the structural flaws in many emerging markets economy and in a way, brought about a great reset for industries, companies and people.I personally learn to appreciate the conventional wisdom of the business leaders before my time and the older generations like my father.Sunway Group has proven to be a resilient organisation which has a core group of industry titans sitting right at the top.They are guided by the success and mistakes of the past, especially the two economic crisis in 1986 and 1997/98 that nearly brought the group down. As they pivot along the industries (property to healthcare) within the conglomerate prudently, it showed bigger is not necessarily better.There is no more fitting illustration of the importance of prudence and fiscal responsibility than the Evergrande episode. Whether Evergrande remains ever grand is a side story. Nonetheless, it should be a lesson to all companies especially those within the property sector.

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Sport,,Will Nur Dhabitah smile again after her ‘diving father’ leaves?,"KUALA LUMPUR: Sad, shocked and speechless.That summed up national women’s diver Nur Dhabitah Sabri’s (pic)emotions after it was announced that her coach Christian Brooker is set to leave the diving camp soon.Describing the Australian coach as akin to her “own father” in diving, the 22-year-old said Brooker’s departure was indeed a big loss as he was the one who made her fall in love with diving once more after she had endured such a torrid time previously.This, Dhabitah said, was due to the fact that she almost gave up diving more than a year ago.It was Brooker’s “never say die” spirit that made her pick herself up and start again.“Because of him, I started to love diving again. I almost gave up and felt that diving was useless, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic hit worldwide,” she said.“It was really tense to train under the sports bubble concept and the fact that I had to part ways with my family for a while made me feel more sad. But I was glad to have Brooker around as he always encouraged me and boosted my spirit to participate in Japan.”The Kuala Lumpur-born athlete said she would definitely miss the 40-year-old coach as he was easy to communicate with, and she felt at ease sharing her problems with him, be it professional or personal issues.Not only that, Dhabitah, who had been under the tutelage of Brooker since 2018, admitted that she never had a dull moment with him and appreciated the way he infused more joy and fun into their training sessions.“He was very supportive, he was not rough towards us - what’s more he doesn’t say mean words during training. He always gave me and other divers the freedom and was easy to discuss things with on any changes that we feel better suit us as the divers.“I like the way he handled the setback in the Tokyo Olympics recently; he never holds grudges and still offers positive feedback regardless of the outcome,” she added.Despite missing out on winning a medal for the country in her second Olympics in Japan, Dhabitah stole the hearts of Malaysians with her commendable performance and radiant smile to finish fourth at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre last month. — Bernama"

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Metro,RSN MURALI: CITYCISM,Give some thought to feral cats,"THERE has been an increase in the number of feral cats in Melaka city in recent months.Some may ask why I have chosen the word “feral” and not “stray”.Well, strays are defined as domesticated felines that have strayed away from their homes while feral cats are animals with no owners.One animal lover from Banda Hilir shared his thoughts on feral cats after observing them for close to a year.The animal lover, Billy, said stray cats relied on humans for food and shelter while feral felines were independent and capable of surviving on their own.Feral cats, he said, would hunt lizards, frogs and insects and some go to rubbish dumps in search of food.According to Billy, ethologists, too have studied the behaviour of feral cats in an urban area.These cats, he said, had the tendency to shy away when humans approach them but there was also the possibility of them pouncing on strangers.Billy said that feral cats looked healthier and cleaner as they were capable of grooming themselves and are much more resilient compared to strays.However, feral cats tend to have low-life expectancy as they are easily preyed upon by civet cats and dogs.Concerns have been also shared by residents on feral cats transmitting diseases to pets, especially female cats.Melaka agriculture, agro-based, entrepreneur development and cooperative committee chairman Datuk Norhizam Hassan Baktee said the abandonment of domesticated cats as well as strays has led to an increase in their population.“We don’t have any facts on feral or stray felines as a study has not been done on them.“Besides, it’s difficult to distinguish between a stray and a feral cat, but I will ask the state Veterinary Services Department to identify locations where these cats are found,” he said, adding that this could be an interesting subject to explore.Norhizam said that so far, there were no reports of people being attacked or hurt by strays or feral cats in Melaka.He said that people should be kinder to these animals and that trapping them was not a good idea.Strays and feral cats, he said, could warm up to people if they knew they would not be harmed.He also voiced concern that these cats could die from consuming sharp and indigestible items from food waste in rubbish bins.Feral cats are a common sight in Ujong Pasir, Bukit Beruang, Cheng and as far as Tanjung Minyak, especially at night as they are nocturnal creatures.The presence of these cats was especially noticeable during lockdown periods as people spent more time at home.Sadly, some feral cats have had the same fate as displaced macaques and wild boars.In fact, the welfare of feral cats as well as other wild animals should be looked into.We should take a leaf from Istanbul, Turkey which hosts a sizeable number of feral cats that are cared for by the community as they are regarded as communally-owned pets.Efforts are also made by various parties to get street cats sterilised.Animal rights is of significance in Turkey and lawmakers there are looking into stricter punishment to deal with animal cruelty.Perhaps, we can learn a thing or two from Turkey, where people treat animals as living beings instead of looking at them as a nuisance.By doing so, we can help street cats survive."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Metro,N. TRISHA,Gyms geared up to reopen,"GYMS in Penang are struggling to stay afloat as they eagerly wait for the green light to reopen.Gym manager JJ Ooi said gym operators were ready to offer their services to the public again.“We have reopened before during the pandemic so we are accustomed to the standard operating procedures (SOP).“We already know what to do,” said Ooi, who manages two gyms that are part of a chain.Ooi said they had been closed since May this year.“We are curious that swimming pools and cinemas can reopen but we are not allowed to do so.“All in during this pandemic, we have been closed for over eight months – three months last year and five this year.”Ooi said personal trainers had suffered the most as for some, it was their only job.“They have resorted to other jobs like delivering food to make ends meet.“I offer online classes but only 20% of the people seem to be okay with that as they prefer face-to-face sessions,” he said.Gym trainer Steven Mark James, 31, who has represented Malaysia in bodybuilding competitions, has seen a drastic drop in his income.He prefers face-to-face sessions and does not like providing online lessons as it is difficult for people to understand instructions that way.“When it is allowed, I go house to house for my sessions.“I was working for a gym but now, we are unsure when the gyms will reopen.“We have been back and forth with the varying information given.“It has been different as I am a bodybuilder and have to sustain myself and keep fit.““I need to take supplements and need an income to support that.“I have resorted to doing other jobs, sometimes holding two to three jobs a day,” he said.It was reported that the Youth and Sports Ministry had prepared the SOP for the gym reopening but the health ministry had issues about the ventilation system.Youth and Sports Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Faisal Azumu had last week appealed to Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin to allow gyms to reopen.Khairy had replied that the Health Ministry would develop ventilation guidelines with the National Security Council (NSC).It is believed these guidelines are not ready and as such, the NSC cannot allow gyms to reopen yet. Penang youth and sports committee chairman Soon Lip Chee said he hoped gyms would be able to operate again by the end of the year."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Metro,EDWARD RAJENDRA,Road users in Klang negotiate large potholes every day,"MOTORISTS who commute regularly along Jalan Sungai Kapar Indah in Klang have to endure nerve-racking drives as they attempt to evade crater-like potholes on the badly damaged asphalt road.This perilous 230m stretch is after the turn-off from Lorong Sungai Puloh, up until the junction outside Jalan Wawasan 3/Ku7.For almost 10 months now, road users have to proceed with extreme caution over this stretch as they negotiate the multiple potholes, which can measure from 3.2m to 4.1m in width.Such hazards scrape the front bumper of vehicles, as car wheels dip into the ever-widening holes.Motorcyclists have been exposed to serious danger, with some falling off their machines.The affected motorists and residents said complaints to Klang Municipal Council (MPK) had fallen on deaf ears.Osman Jalil, 58, drives his 15-year-old vehicle on Jalan Sungai Kapar Indah daily to work at a light industrial plant.Driving on the affected stretch has taken a chunk out of his wallet in repairs for damaged rims and the steering.“I dread going on that stretch of the road.“I see many motorists trying to avoid the potholes and driving at an extremely slow pace to avoid damaging their cars, but this itself causes the risk of an accident with vehicles behind them,” he said.Osman, a father of five, added that he had seen motorcyclists flung off their machines after hitting a pothole, with some having to be admitted to hospital.Another motorist, Mok Soon Chet said the badly damaged part of Jalan Sungai Kapar Indah must be fixed urgently.“It is perilous as cars run into the crater-like potholes that at times are not obvious because they are filled with rainwater.“Some cars have had their side skirting or bumpers fall off after going through the potholes.“Other cars’ alignment and suspensions are affected. Those also negatively impact on their tyres’ wear and tear,” he said.Mok said road users were deeply disappointed with MPK for dragging its feet in addressing the pothole problem.“It is an important and busy stretch because there are numerous businesses in the area.“People want to get to their workplace safely,” he added.Accountant Kamariah Daud urged MPK to solve the problem soon.“Our workers are frustrated over this menace,” she said, noting that whatever method the council used in repairing the road before was ineffective.“MPK needs to reconstruct the road with high quality materials to withstand the weight of hundreds of heavy vehicles that use Jalan Sungai Kapar Indah daily,” she said.Kamariah added that the large potholes along Jalan Wawasan 3/Ku7 must also be addressed.On another issue, Human Resources manager Haslinah Mahmud wants MPK’s Environmental Services Department to desilt the 1.5m-wide drains at Jalan Wawasan 3/Ku7 and along the stretch of Jalan Sungai Kapar Indah that are choked with mud, litter and grass.“We also want MPK to clean up the illegal dumpsite across Jalan Wawasan 3/Ku7,” she said."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Metro,LO TERN CHERN,Homestay owners remain cautious,"THE southwest district of Penang where tourists would usually visit to get up close with nature and the local community is not drawing in visitors despite homestays now allowed to open.Teluk Bahang Homestay manager Rozita Omar, who oversees 11 homestay units near the Penang National Park, said since reopening two weeks ago, there had been no bookings.“We are offering a 20% discount off the usual rates and each stay comes with free breakfast.“Four of our units are private rooms with their own entrance while seven other units are within the same house.“Although some tourist attractions here are still closed, visitors can relax within the quiet neighbourhood next to the beach.“Villagers here are ready to assist in all their needs and for them to learn more about us,” she said.Rozita said stricter standard operating procedures (SOP) for the homestays were introduced to instil confidence among guests such as frequent sanitising of the rooms and limiting the number of guests to each room.“No more crowding is allowed and the number of guests allowed for each room is according to its size and number of beds,” she said.Despite poor response from visitors, she was grateful to be allowed to reopen.“Our guests are usually made up of 40% foreign tourists and 60% locals from other states.“Hopefully locals living here would support us as their stay would mean added income for villagers.“Many of us here who help out to clean and manage the homestays are housewives whose husbands are low-income earners such as fishermen,” she said.Over at Pulau Betong, Desa Lestari Homestay Pulau Betong chairman Amir Yusoff said the homestay operators there decided to remain closed until Covid-19 tapers off.“All 11 homestay units sharing with families and 10 homestay units of individual houses have remained closed since March last year.“The high number of Covid-19 cases is the main concern for us to remain closed although it is a big burden to maintain the properties after almost two years.“The surroundings need to be cleaned frequently and buildings need to be kept in good order as they’re part of the village we live in,” he said.Amir said to prevent further losses, some owners temporarily turned their homestay units into rented houses.“We used to charge guests RM90 per person which includes a welcoming ceremony and at least four meals daily.“They get to experience our lifestyle and we would receive an average of nine days of occupancy every month before the movement control order (MCO) came into effect.“Private houses are rented at a charge of between RM150 and RM450 per night.“Without this income during the pandemic, owners suffer a huge loss of income,” he said.The community however plans to revive the homestay business once the pandemic eases.“We will offer durian season promotions as the village is surrounded by durian orchards.“Events such as cycling and traditional bazaars will be held to attract urbanites seeking relief away from the hustle and bustle of city life,” he said.Among the homestay operators who chose to remain closed is retired teacher Rosle Othman, 59, who had spent RM60,000 to build a twin homestay unit behind his house.“Many customers have called to book but I am reluctant.“As this is a bonus income for me, safety of other villagers and my family is of utmost priority at the moment.“Without the income, we just have to spend wisely.“When I reopen, we will filter our guests and interview them before approving their bookings,” he said.The Government had announced that tourism activities involving homestays and hotels within the same state for those fully vaccinated is allowed for states under Phase Two and beyond of the National Recovery Plan."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Metro,FARID WAHAB,"‘Rivers, waterfalls in Selangor forest reserve areas off limits’","SELANGOR folk planning an outing to riversides and waterfalls in forest reserve areas should cancel their plans as authorities in the state have warned that such places are currently off limits.State Forestry Department director Datuk Ahmad Fadzil Abd Majid said the police would issue compounds to errant individuals found engaging in leisure activities at such places.“The issue is not about needing a permit or being fully vaccinated, as all recreational venues in forest reserves are currently closed.“Members of the public who are found in such areas will be asked to leave immediately.“This directive will remain in effect until further notice,” he told StarMetro.Earlier this week, photos and videos on social media showed crowds of people bathing without minding physical distancing rules at Sungai Pisang located within the Gombak Forest Reserve.Many sightseers have been visiting riversides to picnic and enjoy recreation time with family and friends ever since Klang Valley entered Phase Two of the National Recovery Plan recently.A guideline, released on Sept 9 by National Security Council for states under Phase Two, says picnicking is allowed for fully-vaccinated individuals. They can also bring along children under 17, albeit with strict compliance with the usual standard operating procedures.Central Selangor district forestry officer Khairul Nizam Mohamed told a news portal that the guideline did not include areas in forest reserves.The police, alongside officers from the Forestry Department, Selayang Municipal Council (MPS) and district health office conducted an operation at Sungai Pisang last Thursday.They found 50 visitors there, some of whom had pitched a tent to rest after partaking in outdoor activities.Ahmad Fadzil said further checks found that all the visitors were fully vaccinated, but they were told to leave. No compound was issued.MPS Corporate Department deputy director Ahmad Fauzi Ishak said the council only assisted in the operation, and that the authority to issue compounds was with the police and Health Department.Meanwhile, netizens raised concerns about visitors who had discarded their plastic waste and paper wrappings in the area, including in the river itself.Fadzil Akmar commented on Facebook that visitors should take their rubbish home to be disposed of properly, and that people should behave responsibly to ensure public places were kept clean, especially sites near water sources.Nur Anisah Abdullah said poor hygiene attitudes revealed the mentality of the litterbugs, and urged authorities to be stern by issuing fines."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Metro,YEE XIANG YUN,SHARED RESPONSIBILITY TO AID THE NEEDY,"DRIVEN by the desire to assist the less privileged, a group of like-minded entrepreneurs and business owners have come together to form the Malaysian Social Entrepreneurs Foundation (MSEF).Established in April 2021, the foundation focuses on three main areas, namely educational support, developing well-rounded social leaders to implement and improve public welfare and helping the disadvantaged.MSEF president Datuk Seri Lee Kar Whatt said the foundation’s efforts and plans actually began about one and a half years before its establishment.“One of our intentions was to influence enterprises to come together to unite our resources and strengths to assist the community and B40 groups through targeted initiatives. All they have to do is set aside a portion of their profits to contribute to the foundation.“We have raised approximately RM30mil so far, where about RM10mil have been used for various initiatives such as free meals distribution, medical equipment contribution to hospitals and educational support for students.“We have a shared responsibility to look out for the community and lend a helping hand to those in need,” he said in an interview.Lee added that the foundation hopes that those who benefitted from their programmes to pay it forward and do some good for the community as well.The foundation’s deputy president, Datuk Chan Wah Kiang, said since starting their free meals distribution programme on July 29, more than one million of mainly halal packs of free food have been given out to the needy.“With the help of about 100 volunteers, the free meals were distributed at 130 locations nationwide for lunch and dinner to ensure that the less privileged, those home quarantined and those who lost their jobs will not go hungry.“When the programme first started, most of the food packs were snapped up within 30 minutes, which led us to increase the quantities to feed more people,” he shared, adding that MSEF plans to continue the food distribution programme nationwide until the end of September.However, for certain identified locations, such as places that still have a low vaccination rate, the free food giveaway programme will continue until the allocated funds have been fully utilised.“Through this initiative, we also came into contact with various old folks’ and children’s homes and realised that they faced financial issues due to the lack of donations during the pandemic.“As such, we decided to channel RM300,000 to 32 charity and welfare homes throughout the country to help them get by,” he added.Besides that, Chan noted that MSEF also contributed RM1.85mil worth of oxygen concentrators, consumables and other medical equipment to 10 hospitals, especially those handling daily Covid-19 cases, throughout the country.Touching on the foundation’s top priorities, MSEF executive director Aki Chong Li Chin said last year, the junior chef programme was introduced in two primary schools in Jementah, Segamat for students to learn new skills through cooking.She explains, “MSEF emphasises the importance of education to build a better future for our children and country, which is why we placed education support at the top of our focus areas.“In the junior chef programme, the students explore new things through food preparation, which makes learning a more fun and enjoyable process.“After the programme, we realised that the students also picked up good values such as gratitude, taking the initiative to help out more at home as well as appreciation for their parents.”Chong added that these positive qualities could change a child’s outlook in life as well, noting that MSEF hopes that the beneficial programme could be introduced to more schools soon to enable students to discover their hidden talents.On the topic of education, she said the foundation also aims to continue offering scholarships and education loans to students in need, as well as assist schools to improve their libraries and their gradual digitisation journey through long-term projects.Meanwhile, the foundation’s vice-president Datuk Nelson Tan said MSEF, along with Eco-Shop Malaysia Sdn Bhd and private equity firm Creador, has donated RM6mil to help 6,000 Chinese independent school students with unpaid school fees.He pointed out that the pandemic has impacted many families, with parents facing pay cuts and job losses, which affected their ability to pay for their children’s school fees.“At the same time, schools were also struggling to pay the teachers’ salaries and administrative expenses.“In order to assist them, we decided to jointly channel RM6mil so RM1,000 will be allocated to each of the 6,000 students,” he said.Tan said the foundation also thanked Eco-Shop, whose managing director is also MSEF president, as well as Creador founder Brahmal Vasudevan for their generosity.MSEF encourages more enterprises and business owners to join them in their efforts to spread positivity and assist needy communities.For more information, visit msef.com.my or fb.com/my.msef, get in touch with them via email at my.msef@gmail.com or call 011-5880 5897, or scan the QR code."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Sport,RAJES PAUL，RAJESPAUL,"Go where your heart is Jin Wei, it’s not too late to make a U-turn","YOUNGSTERS Emma Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez took the world of tennis by storm last week with their incredible performances in the US Open.At 18, Raducanu became a Grand Slam champion and the first from England to win it in 44 years.She defeated a worthy opponent in 19-year-old Fernandez from Canada - in a match that marked the emergence of future stars who will continue to bring the fans, revenue, and attention to the sport.But young as they may be, their success was not achieved overnight or without any hardships.The duo have many things in common – they are bright, hard-working, and talented; they have come through good junior programmes; they have a good team behind them; they speak confidently, and what they say reflects good sportsmanship and their quality as players.In the US too, two of our Malaysian youngsters gave the country something to cheer about in collegiate golf over the last two weeks when the 20-year-olds Liyana Durisic and Zulaikah Nurziana Nasser emerged as winners at the Wolverine International in Michigan and USA Intercollegiate in Alabama respectively.They too had made many sacrifices, like leaving their families behind, in pursuit of success.While these tennis and golf youngsters are looking ahead to the future with much hope and determination to excel even further, right at home in Malaysia, shuttler Goh Jin Wei – just one year older than the budding golf stars – has turned her back on it all.Jin Wei has chosen to give up the sport that she loves and announced her retirement on Monday, which came as a shock to many.From her junior days, the tiny gem from Penang has been simply outstanding.Shorter than most of her opponents, she would take part in categories with the bigger girls and get huge satisfaction in beating them.She did not let her physical disadvantage stop her from toying with her opponents through intelligent play and gung-ho performances.At 16, she was the country’s national champion.The two-time world junior champion then went on to save the blushes for Malaysia by winning the solitary badminton gold at the 2017 Kuala Lumpur SEA Games – when all other favourites wilted under the pressure at home.I still remember the roar of fans shouting and cheering her on with Jia You! Jin Wei! Jia You! Jin Wei! repeatedly at the almost full Axiata Arena in Bukit Jalil during the semi-finals of the KL Games against the favourite Pornpawee Chochuwong of Thailand.She was touted as a future medallist in the Olympics Games but just before the Tokyo Olympics, injuries and health issues affected her form, fire, and self-belief.She got better just before the start of 2020 but the Covid-19 pandemic delivered a further blow when she was unable to compete – and with her ranking having plummeted from 24 to 128, it became harder.It’s understandable that Jin Wei is going through a hard time. It’s not easy to revive the fire that had once burnt bright.On the one hand, she wants to give her best and on the other, as much as she tries, it’s mentally tiring for her battered mind and body to come out from one’s lowest pit.It’s not that help had not been extended to Jin Wei.The Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) had offered to give her the best treatment by sending her overseas to look into her injury and there was also an option of taking a short break and switching to another event.But Jin Wei has to first deal with the tug-of-war in her mind. There will always be factors that one can’t control.It could range from constant changes, selection issues, an unconducive environment, different coaching styles, and even unkind words hurled by others.There could be other challenges too. Only the players know the pressures they face.Physical injuries will heal. Just look at Soniia Cheah – she battled through her injuries to finally make that trip to the Tokyo Olympic Games.It’s our hope that Jin Wei will get the right advice from those who see her talent and care for her.Eventually, with good counsel, she may make a U-turn to give her badminton career another shot – and we believe there are many good years ahead of her.I’m sure the BAM will welcome her back or even give her the blessings to turn pro.But it all depends on where her heart – and her mind – is.If it’s not in the game, we can wish her the best to move on.But if badminton remains her first love, she could yet conquer the world and stand smiling victoriously – as Raducanu did."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Metro,JEREMY TAN,Sweet note of appreciation,"Penang House of Music’s (PHoM) efforts to safeguard the musical, artistic and cultural heritage of the state and country have caught the eye of foreign organisations.Besides generating publicity, the recognition also led to invitations for PHoM founder and director Paul Augustin to speak at two major international virtual conferences.He was a panellist in a discussion held as part of Unesco Bangkok’s launch of its ‘Backstage: Managing Creativity and the Arts in Southeast Asia’ report and a book titled ‘Re-imagining Creative Cities in Twenty-First Century Asia’.Held on Aug 14, the event highlighted the challenges faced by creative industry organisations in the Covid-19 pandemic plus the key differentiators that allow some to be successful.Next up, Augustin will be a keynote speaker at the International Association for Sound and Audiovisual Archives 2021 Conference from Sept 27 to 30.He will give a 40-minute presentation on PHoM’s journey and take part in a 20-minute Q&A session.“These invitations are great opportunities not only for the PHoM team and me but also for Penang and Malaysia to be recognised internationally for efforts in preserving intangible heritage like music and the arts.“It is something we’re passionate about and it shows that what we do makes a difference and is appreciated,” Augustin said.Looking back to November 2016 when PHoM first opened, he said it had been a tough journey but also an exciting one filled with discoveries.“People often don’t realise the huge impact that music has on their everyday lives.“Music evokes emotions. When you’re happy, you sing a happy song. When you’re sad, you listen to a sad song and it can make you feel better!“It has the power to influence moods, motivate or inspire. Just imagine a world without music. It would be devoid of life and soul,” Augustin added."

AVINESHWARAN,Rawilson admits fault but aims to lead team back to top,"PETALING JAYA: Handling poor results as the leader of a football team is never easy.Sabah’s captain Rawilson Batuil not only knows it but he has done the noble thing by owning up for his lacklustre performance in the Super League.While unhappy with his form, the skipper has promised to lead the team to a better showing in the Malaysia Cup starting on Sept 25.Sabah finished ninth with 19 points, just three points shy of the relegation zone.Their poor outing in the league saw the club rest Indonesian Kurniawan Dwi Yulianto and appoint former national Under-23 coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee as the new head coach.Centreback Rawilson said they should forget about their rough time and look to make amends.“I will be honest...it wasn’t great and satisfying at all. I wasn’t happy with my performance and our outing. We have to bounce back in the Malaysia Cup,” said Rawilson, who has been playing for the club since 2013.“We’ve to do extra work in training to fix our flaws and go in strong. We have a new head coach, and the players are looking forward to re-start again under him.“Kim Swee has coached the national sides and has lots of international experience too. I hope we can adapt to his tactics and do something special.”Rawilson started in 19 Super League games but was part of a porous defence that conceded a whopping 38 goals in 22 matches.It’s the third worst defensive record in the Super League behind relegated Perak and UiTM.He revealed that teamwork needed to be better if they wanted to show their true form and concede fewer goals in the Malaysia Cup.“It is not a great feeling to concede that many goals, and we will remedy it. We hope to toughen up the defence under our new coach.“I will also take my own initiative too to work on some of the flaws we’ve shown this season.”Despite the conundrum in the league, Rawilson believes Sabah have what it takes to shock the odds.Sabah are in Group D with Super League champions Johor Darul Ta’zim, Petaling Jaya City and fourth-placed Premier League team.“Our target, we hope, is to get to the semi-finals. Together, with good harmony and chemistry, we can make it all the way to that stage.”"

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Metro,SHAUN ORANGE,On-form Chelsea get the nod,"SPURS face their toughest test yet when they play Chelsea at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a London derby this weekend.It is a fixture that can go some way to laying bare just how far Nuno Espirito Santo’s side still has to go before they entertain realistic aspirations of challenging the Big Four — Manchester City, Liverpool, tomorrow’s visitors and Manchester United.Tottenham got off to their best start yet in the Premier League when chalking up three wins on the trot, including the narrow victory over champions City, who appeared wobbly in their opener.But then they came down to earth with a heavy thud last weekend when Crystal Palace registered their first triumph of the new campaign.And against a Chelsea side that is brimming with confidence and spearheaded by the free-scoring Romelu Lukaku, Spurs could find themselves with even greater pain to deal with.Chelsea are locked in a four-way tie at the top of the Premiership after four matches and are second only by virtue of goal difference.They have conceded just once — in the draw with Liverpool — and in the other three games have scored two or more. And therein lies Chelsea’s fortitude.They have a solid rearguard in place, built around goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, and defenders César Azpilicueta, Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rüdiger, with support down the flanks from Reece James and Marcos Alonso.To spice things up or add a different thrust, German manager Thomas Tuchel turns to Thiago Silva and Benjamin Chilwell.But perhaps more importantly, they now also boast a renewed source for goals in Lukaku.The big Belgian centre-forward has established himself as a top class striker in Europe, having illuminated the Serie A last season and carried that prolific form from Inter Milan to Stamford Bridge. For good measure, he has four goals from four starts for the Blues so far in his second coming at Chelsea.In his first stint as a Chelsea player between 2011 and 2014, during which time he was also loaned out to West Bromwich Albion and Everton, Lukaku only made 10 appearances and without a goal to show for it.He has returned as a genuine threat to all whom they play, and how Man United must be licking their lips.Lukaku joined the Red Devils in 2017 before leaving in 2019 after 66 matches and 28 goals — making nowhere near the sort of impact that was expected after he arrived for an initial £75mil and another £15mil in add-ons.Tottenham will not worry too much about all his history as they fix their attention on trying to thwart his advances on their goal. Given Lukaku’s exploits thus far, Spurs’ best efforts look like they will not be able to keep him out.But the home side have a classy striker of their own, who could well make his presence felt. England captain Harry Kane has the pedigree to unsettle Chelsea and with a bit of good fortune, turn the tables on the more fancied side.Last weekend, Spurs’ talisman was starved of the good service needed upfront to get among the goals against Palace.Earlier this week Tottenham were reportedly considering the inclusion of Argentinians Giovani Lo Celso and Cristian Romero, and Columbia’s Davinson Sanchez in the squad to face Chelsea.The trio is only expected to arrive in London today after spending time in Croatia, training on their own. They travelled to their countries during the international break “without the permission” of their club, and to avoid self-isolation on their return to England, they remained in Croatia since.But with Eric Dier a doubt after an injury at Palace and Japhet Tanganga suspended because of his red card in that game, Nuno will be left with few options.Spurs also have injury concerns over South Korean Heung-min Son and Dutchman Steven Bergwijn.Tottenham will no doubt be keen to give a good account of themselves against one of the contenders of the league title.Failure to do so will not only have Nuno and Co. lose face in a big London derby, but they will also concede more ground in their efforts to mix things with big boys and fight for silverware."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Metro,IVAN LOH,Can Palace see off Liverpool as well?,"THE match against Crystal Palace will test Liverpool’s credentials as the “mentality monsters” Juergen Klopp has made them out to be.Having earned a hard-fought 3-2 win over AC Milan during the UEFA Champions League group stage match, the Reds are facing the Eagles just two days later.With barely enough time to rest, let alone prepare for the match, it will be a tough game for Liverpool.Crystal Palace will be out to wear down the Merseysiders with their high intensity play.They will be soaring high with confidence after demolishing Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 last week.It must be said that under the stewardship of Arsenal legend Patrick Vieira, the Eagles are playing with more urgency now, like how they suppressed Tottenham’s attack, limiting them to only just two shots the entire game.Crystal Palace, meanwhile, had 18 shots and 63% possession.Wilfried Zaha in particular played very well, tormenting the Spurs’ defence with his speed and trickery and will be the threat Liverpool needs to be wary of.Another threat would be new signing from Celtic, Odsonne Edouard who had a dream debut with two goals and could even make the starting line-up in place of former Reds Christian Benteke.It was quite a surprise to see how Klopp kept Virgil van Dijk on the bench against AC Milan, surely with one eye on Palace.The German is not particularly known for rotating his players but perhaps he did so to keep his team fresh as the Netherlands captain now looks certain to start.Players with injury records like Joel Matip and Jordan Henderson should also perhaps be rested now to minimise the risk of injuries.It is fortunate that the Reds are blessed with options at the back and in midfield, with the attack the only concern.In midfield, Fabinho continues to show why he is indispensable and will likely retain his place.Thiago Alcantara also did well and would merit a spot alongside Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Curtis Jones or James Milner.Up front, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Diogo Jota are expected to start again, with Takumi Minamino and Divock Origi acting as back-up.Overall, Liverpool have a good record against Palace — 33 wins, 11 draws and 14 defeats.The Reds have also won the last four home league games and will hope to have enough in their tank to maintain their record and winning streak against the visiting side."

In Tokyo, Malaysia failed to win any medals.Andy Low, head of the diving committee for MS, said they would be recommending a new Chinese coach to replace Brooker.“We will try out a different approach. We did not do as well as what we had hoped for at the Tokyo Olympics last month and we need to find ways to improve,” said Andy.“Paris is just three years away and we may have to review our training programme to bring back a medal again.“The synchro events are still our best hope and we have to identify our divers now.“We did not have any male representative in Tokyo and we hope to change that in Paris.”The fate of the other coaches handling the national team will also be reviewed but Li Rui’s position should be safe as Pandelela Rinong took gold at the Diving World Cup in May.The national body will also have to identify new back-up divers to be ready for the Olympics qualification for Paris and find a replacement for the 36-year-old Leong Mun Yee, who competed in her last Olympics in Tokyo.In Tokyo, Nur Dhabitah Sabri was the only bright spark when she finished fourth in the women’s 3m springboard individual final.Pandelela-Mun Yee went to Tokyo as medal contenders but finished eighth in the women’s 10m platform synchro final while Pandelela missed out on a third straight Olympics medal after a nightmare opening dive in the individual event.Pandelela, who won bronze and silver in London 2012 and Rio de Janeiro 2016, was placed last in the field of 12 finalists."

They will also compete in the Czech Republic International from Oct 21-24 in Brno and the Belgian International from Oct 27-30 in Leuven.This means Fazriq’s partnership with Justin Hoh in the doubles is over as the latter has decided to concentrate only on the singles.In the world junior rankings, the two are the best Malaysian pair, lying at fifth spot.Together with Justin, Fazriq had won the Bangladesh Junior International title, finished runners-up in the Malaysia Junior International and won several other local age-group titles.In their last tournament together this year, the duo went down in the second round of the Austrian Open, which was a senior tournament.Fazriq said he was excited about his new journey in his bid to emulate his father Razif Sidek, who ruled the badminton scene in the doubles with brother Jalani in the 1980s and early 1990s.“I’m still training in both the singles and doubles at the centre but I’ve made up my mind to choose the doubles,” said Fazriq, who is in the national junior squad headed by Datuk Misbun Sidek.“I’ve been asked to play both for the time being in the junior ranks but it will be doubles all the way after this.“As Justin is not keen on the doubles, I’ve started training with Vin Sean, who is also 17. Our first test will be the German juniors and we hope to get off to a good start,” said Fazriq.The junior singles players train under Hazwan Jamaluddin while the doubles players are handled by former international Vountus Indra Mawan."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Metro,JADE CHAN，JAROD LIM,Flavours of change,"HOTELS and restaurants that heavily relied on dine-in and walk-in customers prior to the Covid-19 pandemic have had to restrategise to sell their mooncakes.Since movement restrictions have curtailed the usual way of selling, and with mall events also curbed, food and beverage (F&B) businesses have had to adapt in order to market these festive creations.StarMetro speaks to several established ventures to find out how they have pivoted, ahead of the Mid-Autumn Festival on Sept 21.Adopting dining concierge serviceThe Oriental Group believes that regular communication with customers is key to sustaining its business.“We reach out to customers through our loyalty programme, the Cuisine Club, via electronic messaging services,” said The Oriental Group operations general manager (external affairs) Lyn Siew.“To keep our customers engaged, we churn out new menus and promotional items fortnightly, almost like clockwork.“We also offer something similar to a dining concierge service, whereby customers can contact our outlet managers to tailor orders to their requirements.“We aim to provide customers peace of mind when it comes to food preparation and delivery, which adhere to the highest hygiene and safety standards,” she added.The group also works closely with its mall landlords to leverage on their respective databases in marketing its takeaway promotions.“Whenever movement restrictions were enforced, we pivoted 50% of our takeaway sales to online platforms through our own and other third-party e-commerce platforms,” said Siew.“The remaining 50% is restaurant- based through our in-house teams, as we still prioritise serving our customers directly.“This human touch, despite the pandemic, remains a core principle as we still value direct relationships with our customers,” she said.Despite dine-in restrictions last year, Siew said the group recorded a boost in mooncake sales, as they were generally regarded as takeaway or gifting items.She is optimistic about seeing a similar boost this year.“The Mid-Autumn Festival is observed by the Chinese community annually.“This is the main reason we expanded our mooncake range this year to have new and relevant products so customers have more choices,” she explained.The group added four new flavours this year – including the Custard Durian Snow Skin and Ying Yang Red Bean Snow Skin – to complement its existing range of four popular flavours that includes Yam Paste Teochew Style and Shanghai Style.On the packaging, Siew said the quality of boxes were maintained but the design and colours were “elevated to a modern abstract direction”.“We did not impose any premium pricing this year, taking into consideration the general consumer spending during current economic circumstances.“Consistent flavour and quality remain our priority.“Our mooncakes are freshly prepared in our kitchens with no preservatives,” she stressed.Keeping to only bestsellers and limiting production amountGrand Imperial Group business development manager Maggie Chow said the restaurant decided to only offer its top-selling mooncakes which customers look forward to every year.“Mid-Autumn is an important festival among the Chinese, who buy mooncakes as gifts.“Some even enjoy mooncakes in the month leading up to the festival day.“But since we were not allowed to have booths at malls during earlier lockdowns, this affected our sales.“So we decided to limit our mooncake selections, leaving out snow skin versions as they have a shorter shelf life,” she explained.The group produced four traditional baked mooncake flavours this year – Single Yolk White Lotus Paste, Single Yolk Pandan Lotus Paste, Double Yolk Lotus Paste and Red Bean Paste with Citrus.By limiting the flavours, Chow said the group was able to ensure that only the best of its mooncakes were produced.“We made about 500 mooncakes a day and only made more when those ran out.“So customers were always assured of the freshest products, both low in sugar and using premium quality ingredients,” she said.“If there were a lot of orders, our chefs would adjust production accordingly.“We also retained last year’s classy wooden mooncake box design as it was popular with customers,” she added.Additionally, the group took a fresh approach in reaching out to customers through regular livestreaming sessions, said Chow.“During the livestream, we also update customers on our new products, meals and dim sum packages.”Thanks to support from its customers and the group’s strategic planning, she said its mooncakes for this year were already sold out.Investing in online presence and product made for takeawayVanilla Crepe founder and chief executive officer Nelson Liew said the company had always dedicated significant budget and effort into solidifying its presence online, hence it was not badly affected by dine-in restrictions.“The business has never relied heavily on dine-in or events as our products are mostly take-home treats for the family.“The ‘moon crepe’ (what the company calls its mooncakes) business is also one which is gifted to family and friends and can be delivered, so that is a big help,” he highlighted.He said their “moon crepe” business was also one driven by Internet eyeballs and word of mouth.“We made some minor adjustments in our marketing approach this year by investing more into making sure our products were visible online and beautifully presented.“This included engaging high-end photography and videography services plus investing in online promotions.“The opportunity lost from not having booths at malls was translated into more shoutouts online to garner a similar response from the public,” he added.Vanilla Crepe’s “moon crepe” flavours this year include bestsellers Rainbow and Mango Peach as well as new flavours KitKat and Jobbie Nut Butter, which have been created in collaboration with Nestle and Jobbie.In terms of packaging, there are two types.“The luxury box caters to a slightly higher-income group who is willing to spend for special occasions,” said Liew.“The lite box is a more economical option for those on a budget.”He expects the Mooncake Festival to provide a boost to Vanille Crepe, which has 30 stores in Malaysia.This year, the company’s moon crepes are also available in Sabah and Sarawak as well as Singapore and Hong Kong.Creating meaningful packaging and better delivery optionsSt Regis Kuala Lumpur general manager Renato De Oliveira said the Covid-19 situation challenged his team to deliver the same St Regis experience to guests in their homes.“We did this by creating exceptional takeaway and delivery options, such as using beautiful packaging for our classic afternoon tea set to recreate the elegant three-tier stand.“We also created cooking kits accompanied by QR codes with instructions and personalised videos from our chefs.“There were classic cocktail kits with masterclass sessions as well, so guests could recreate their favourite meals and drinks at home,” he elaborated.De Oliveira shared that online platforms played an important role in ensuring that all of the hotel’s products and experiences were well-communicated and promoted.“We use those platforms to promote our mooncakes and share the story behind the mooncake trunks (packaging),” he said, crediting his marketing team for the e-content that reflects the efforts and passion behind the hotel’s products.“Our faux-leather mooncake trunks take inspiration from the Astor family’s love for travel, and we are thrilled to unveil a new version every year.“This year, we paid homage to our founder John Jacob Astor IV’s exquisite penmanship during his many voyages and his travelling stationery trunk.”On the mooncake flavours, De Oliveira said St Regis Kuala Lumpur took pride in maintaining its traditional flavour – white lotus seed paste – in two sizes.The Mooncake Festival has always brought in very strong demand, and De Oliveira believes this year will be no different.“As current restrictions don’t allow a large-scale celebration, people are choosing to show their love and care by gifting their loved ones with mooncakes,” he said.Focus on domestic market and drive-through convenienceHilton regional general manager (Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam) Jamie A. Mead said the hotel had revised its customer marketing strategy by putting greater focus on the domestic audience and spending more on online media.“Our distribution model has been evolving towards the online space over the past four years.“However, within the Covid-19 period, this has rapidly skewed the percentages towards e-commerce or online dependency, both on owned and third-party channels,” he said.Hilton Kuala Lumpur also had to adopt new processes to promote and sell its mooncakes.“In the past, we would have relied on sales through our own mooncake boutique in the lobby area.“But we have had to evolve our approach by catering to the local market this year.“This was done by embracing delivery services and opening our first drive-through mooncake outlet in the lobby drop-off area of Hilton Kuala Lumpur’s main entrance,” said Mead.On packaging, the hotel continues with its strategy of offering a new premium mooncake box of high quality and finish.This year’s highlight is the Jade Moon gift box, featuring a ceramic tea set and Chynna Restaurant’s signature Eight Treasures Tea with a choice of traditional baked or snow skin mooncakes.“We have retained our bestselling mooncakes from previous years, such as the Heavenly Gold Durian Snow Skin Mooncake,” said Mead.“The signature mooncake this year is the Royal Jade Snow Skin Mooncake, containing a white lotus paste and salted mung bean filling, contrasted with crunchy cashew nut nibs.”He said the Mooncake Festival had always provided a boost in business.“With consumers being more mindful of their spending this year, there appears to be greater demand for products like the mooncake box, which is convenience for both collection and delivery,” he added."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,INTAN FARHANA ZAINUL,Hitting the reset button for corporate Malaysia,"TWO years ago, video conferencing was a tool used by only a few. Company officials preferred meetings in person even if it meant travelling abroad to seal a deal, or go through lengthy negotiations.Staff meetings were mostly in the office, and face-to-face. Today, almost all of that is conducted online.Despite a partial return to normalcy as we know it, video conferencing does look like it is here to stay. It has proven to be an effective and cheap means of communication.But what the Covid-19 pandemic brought was to force organisations to adapt to changes. It has been a litmus test of resilience. Companies are facing not only changes in the way they conduct day-to-day business but also how they face an economic crisis.Consumer behaviour has changed and so too has the mindset of investors and stakeholders. For some time now, investors have been opting to put their money into companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.A huge amount of money is going into ESG-related funds. According to S&P Global, in 2020, ESG funds in the United States reached US$51bil (RM212.64bil) in assets under management, doubling from 2019 and a 10-fold jump from 2018.It is expected that ESG funds globally would surge to US$53 trillion (RM220.98 trillion) by 2035.“Companies are taking matters surrounding ESG and digitalisation more seriously based on the recognition of the risk of fading into oblivion if they fail to be forward-looking in their approach,” says KPMG Malaysia head of sustainability Kasturi Nathan.She points out that economic disruptions during the ongoing pandemic have brought to light the urgency towards more sustainable consumption and production life cycles.“We’ve seen how companies are pushed to the limits of operational viability when they continue to utilise scarce and non-renewable resources, prioritise sales of new products, and fail to collaborate, innovate or adapt.“In contrast, a company with a sustainable or circular economy mindset will be well insulated from value chain disruptions because it will have engineered a way to extract limitless value from its resources,” Kasturi adds.Berjaya Corp Bhd (BCorp) CEO Abdul Jalil Abdul Rasheed says ESG adoption by corporations like Berjaya is a natural progression.“Sustainable investing is no longer a fringe subject and is very much here to stay. It is critical not just because of the obvious ‘green’ issues but because strong performances across the pillars of ESG suggest that a business commands some level of resilience,” he tells StarBizWeek.While the ESG concept is not new, it is brought into focus after large Malaysian corporations such as Top Glove Corp Bhd, FGV Holdings Bhd and Sime Darby Plantations Bhd were alleged to have questionable labour practices.It took more than a year for Top Glove to resume selling its glove products to the US after it was banned by the US Customs and Border Protection last July.Another palpable change taking place in corporate Malaysia is the efforts being taken by giants such as national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd and utility provider Tenaga Nasional Bhd to lead the way by announcing their commitment to have net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.Technology turbo-chargedJalil of BCorp notes that the prerequisite for post-pandemic success is agility, namely the ability to pivot and make business decisions quickly, a process that traditionally took longer.And that the adoption of technology is no longer a competitive advantage but an “absolute necessity.”“Covid-19 has presented itself as an opportunity for the Berjaya Group to identify our core strengths while putting a spotlight on areas of distress.“One of our first objectives is to streamline the business so as to create clarity, synergy and greater transparency,” he says.In the next two years, he reckons that BCrop will be focusing on mining the value of its assets that will eventually turn it into a strong and agile investment holding company.BCorp is a diversified conglomerate, with 109 subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures.Under its new strategic plan, BCorp plans asset divestments worth RM2bil over two years and RM5bil over five years and a reduction of its debt level from RM5bil to RM2.5bil over three years. It is also implementing a dividend policy for all operating companies.Forecasting mega trendsErnst & Young PLT Malaysia turnaround and restructuring strategy leader Datuk Stephen Duar says many corporations were “woefully underprepared” when the pandemic emerged.This was despite the fact that “infectious diseases” was cited as one of the top 10 global risks in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Risks Report 2020.“As we have witnessed during the pandemic, most corporates and businesses have limitations in forecasting mega trends, which are trends and forces outside their usual scope of analysis, and understanding what the drivers are for long-term risk and opportunity,” he says.Duar says the pandemic has revealed inherent weaknesses in many business models.He says digital and technological disruptions have already been underway in recent years but the pandemic has intensified its pace.“For example, the prolonged movement control order (MCO) has forced many corporations to rethink their business delivery model in response to shifts in consumer purchasing behaviour.”He adds that the pandemic, coupled with recent “climate disasters”, has exacerbated social challenges such as rising inequality, growing human rights abuses in supply chains and collapsing social safety nets, especially in developing countries.“For example, calls for action against labour abuses, such as insufficient health and safety measures and wage cuts amid the Covid-19 pandemic, has resulted in companies having to issue public statements on their practices and making commitments on better employment practices.“As more issues are being mainstreamed and openly discussed, more companies are beginning to understand that considering ESG risks and opportunities is not just good business but an imperative strategy to maintain the social licence to operate, regardless of sector or industry,” Duar says.This week, British American Tobacco (M) Bhd laid out its sustainable strategy dubbed “A Better Tomorrow” with the aim of reducing risks associated with smoking cigarettes as part of its new strategy focusing on sustainability.“We will work to reduce the health impact of our business and at the same time champion environmental, social and governance excellence.“We believe this will drive the company’s long-term business sustainability and create shared value for consumers, society, employees and our shareholders,” BAT Malaysia legal and external affairs head Nicholas Booth said at a press conference on Tuesday.The tobacco company also said it will be benchmarking itself against the FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia ESG rating.The FTSE4Good index is used to measure companies that meet ESG compliance set by FTSE Russel. Right now, there are only 76 companies listed in the index out of 933 listed companies on Bursa Malaysia.Facing a difficult situationSome companies are also facing declining earnings and tight cashflow due to the pandemic, which are driving them to restructure.Take the case of Boustead Holdings Bhd. While the company has announced its digitalisation plan, it is also in the race to sell its assets and non-core businesses to improve its depleting cash and pare down its huge debt that stands at RM7.5bil.Boustead, however, has not elaborated on its digitisation efforts, which has drawn some criticism from the market as the group is very much a brick-and-mortar company trying to shake off some legacy issues.The aviation industry has also been hit. Driven by the bleak outlook, AirAsia has been quick to enhance digitalisation, pivoting into e-commerce, ride-hailing, food delivery and growing its logistics arm Teleport.AirAsia is also raising funds to keep its airlines business afloat.Since the pandemic, the company has gone through almost various means to raise funds including private placements, rights issues and government-guaranteed loans.AirAsia’s digitalisation efforts started in 2016 and are starting to pay off. AirAsia expects its non-airline revenues to contribute up to half of group revenue in the next three to five years, and gradually overtake the airline revenue.The group is now working on creating what it calls an Asean super app, which aims to offer all its services on one platform.Deloitte Malaysia CEO Yee Wing Peng notes that there could be a significant cut in air travel post-pandemic as more companies embrace technology and digitalisation.“As an international firm with global offices worldwide, Deloitte also recognises the impact of our carbon footprint. In April 2021, we launched the Deloitte WorldClimate initiative, where we pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, and one of the key initiatives is to cut air travel,” he says.He expects more “distress-related” mergers and acquisitions to take place in the hospitality, aviation, retail, wholesale and automotive sectors.He reckons that companies now have changed their strategies, moving from “acquiring for growth” to “acquiring to transform”, with technology being the main focus.“Companies that take advantage of this can implement new business and operating models for a combined or separate entity, and drive significant revenue growth and sustainable margin improvement,” he says.According to PwC Malaysia deals leader Victor Saw, at the onset of the pandemic, many companies in Malaysia adopted the “wait-and-see” approach believing that they had sufficient cash reserves to sustain themselves through the pandemic.“Clearly, many thought the pandemic would only last for a few months. The continuous lockdowns, however, have put a significant strain on their cash reserves and as the economy begins to open up, the demand for working capital has never been more critical.“We are seeing a greater number of companies wanting to divest their non-core assets in order to shore up liquidity and allocate their resources towards their core business as government assistance and moratoriums come to an end,” he says.Based on PwC Malaysia’s 2021 “Act Now To Recover” survey on business recovery among Malaysian business leaders and owners, he says about 65% of respondents have used a rapid cost-reduction programme to help relieve operational and liquidity pressures.In the short term, he believes that corporations may want to place greater scrutiny on their cash and working capital requirements to be more agile.“The journey to recovery is certainly challenging yet it also presents an opportunity for businesses to reinvent themselves to continue to stay relevant to the market’s needs.“This may mean that corporations need to continuously reassess their business model amid significant disruption caused by the pandemic to not only stay afloat but to survive and thrive,” Saw says."
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",,Business,EUGENE MAHALINGAM,Pick-up in deals seen in near term,"WITH the acceleration of the nationwide vaccination programme and reopening of more economic and social sectors, a pick-up in property transactions in the near term looks promising.And with the Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) also coming to a tentative end on Dec 31, industry observers and property consultants are optimistic that buyers will be scouting for new homes.Savills Malaysia Sdn Bhd group managing director Datuk Paul Khong says he expects many prospective buyers to capitalise on the discounts and rebates offered under the HOC, before time runs out.“This year has been a challenging year with more than three months of full lockdown and as we head towards the end of 2021, many buyers may still decide to pick up a new property to enjoy the final discount packages from developers and incentives under the HOC.“We do not expect a big surge in property purchases for the remainder of 2021 but may see some last-minute buyers who have been waiting out since the start of the year,” he tells StarBizWeek.Knight Frank deputy managing director Keith Ooi says while the housing market is on a recovery path, prices, however, are anticipated to remain flat.“Although there was an improvement in transactional activity in the first quarter of this year, the average house price for Kuala Lumpur, a buyer’s market, was lower by 3.1% year-on-year.“This is likely attributed to weaker demand amid rising inventory as potential buyers and investors adopt the wait-and-see approach during this trying time.”In contrast, he says, average house prices for Penang remained resilient with 0.2% growth, supported by initiatives under the various stimulus packages and the HOC.“Moving forward, with domestic investors shifting from the stock market to safer and less volatile alternative investment products, supported by the record-low interest rate environment, lockdown savings and attractive property deals, the overall housing market is expected to gradually recover throughout 2022.“But prices in general are expected to remain flattish.”Going forward, Ooi says the overall value in the residential sub-sector in Malaysia is likely to remain soft throughout 2021.“Pricing for prime housing, particularly landed properties, are expected to gradually rise throughout 2022, as the property market is widely expected to start recovering on the back of a more positive outlook,” he says.According to Knight Frank’s latest Global Buyer Survey, the line between primary and secondary residences has become distorted during the lockdown.“With children being home educated and parents working remotely, some home owners have spent a longer amount of time at home.”Khong says the ongoing HOC will continue to spur demand for primary homes.“We see good discounts offered on many new projects and the entry costs are much lower for buyers.“This is a good time to shop for properties. The secondary market has also taken a hit due to the pandemic. As such, asking prices have become attractive and this segment of the market is expected to stay competitive.”Khong adds that the medium, high-rise segment will continue to perform in 2022, as these are considered safe products catered for the mass market.“Demand in this segment is expected to stay relatively strong, especially for those projects located in well-established neighbourhoods with good accessibility, especially via public transportation.“The landed terrace house segment will also be another sector to watch. We expect to see some good launches from the township developers on their landed housing projects into the last quarter.”UOB Kay Hian in a recent report says it expects resilient underlying demand for landed properties from home occupiers and upgraders when the pent-up demand kicks in, as was evidenced in the first quarter of this year.“We prefer developers that focus on township development, matured areas and landed properties at this point.“We foresee pent-up demand towards the fourth quarter of 2021, given the projected herd immunity by year-end, low interest-rate environment and the ongoing HOC.”The HOC was initially kicked off in January 2019 to address the overhang problem in the country. The campaign, which was initially intended for six months, was extended for a full year.It proved successful, having generated sales totalling RM23.2bil in 2019, surpassing the government’s initial target of RM17bil.The government reintroduced the HOC in June last year under the Penjana initiative to boost the property market after it was adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The campaign has been extended to the end of this year, with property consultants and developers fully supporting the move.In March this year, during the Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association’s briefing on the property market for 2021, its president Datuk Soam Heng Choon revealed that since the HOC was reintroduced last June, a total of 34,354 residential units valued at RM25.65bil had been sold as at Feb 28, 2021.Additionally, UOB Kay Hian says long-term fundamentals remain unexciting.“The market’s long-term growth prospects could continue to be clouded by structural issues such as unresolved supply glut and deteriorating affordability.”The research house adds that the revised Malaysia My Second Home programme, with stricter terms to foreign buyers, could cast a shadow over the already subdued economy and the housing market over time.“Yet, we expect marginal impact on the developers in the near term as foreign buyers account for less than 5% of their property sales.“We understand the new housing minister is re-examining the new criteria imposed and we are hopeful for a positive outcome,” UOB Kay Hian says.Meanwhile, the National Property Information Centre (Napic), says the acceleration of the nationwide vaccination drive and National Recovery Plan threshold across the states will see the reopening of more economic and social sectors in the fourth quarter of 2021.“Supported by the implementation of various government initiatives and assistance, the property market is expected to be on the recovery path, in line with the gradual economic recovery,” it says in a statement.According to Napic data for the first half of 2021, there were 92,017 transactions worth RM34.51bil recorded during the period.This represented a year-on-year increase of 22.2% in volume and 34.7% in value.“Performance across the states improved in the review period. All states recorded higher market volume except for Putrajaya. The four major states, namely Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Johor and Penang, formed about 50% of the total national residential volume.”In the primary market, Napic says there were 16,660 units launched, down by 34% against 25,227 units in the first half of 2020.“Against the second half of 2020, the new launches were lower by 24.1%.”Sales performance in the first half of 2021 stood at 24.7%, surpassing the 12.9% recorded in the previous corresponding period.“The improvement in sales performance can be attributed to the various measures by the government such as incentives under the HOC and low interest rate.”By property type, Napic says terraced houses dominated new launches in the first half of this year.“Single-storey (2,624 units) and two and three-storey (5,455) units together contributed 48.5% of the total units, followed by condominium/apartment units at 41.4% share (6,893 units).”Meanwhile, the residential overhang level exhibited a moderated growth, Napic says.“A total of 31,112 overhang units worth RM20.09bil was recorded, showing an increase of 5.2% and 6.2% in volume and value, respectively, against the preceding half.”"

Both roles have their charm and each faces their own challenges. It’s a co-op game, but you don’t get to share a screen with your co-player.Instead the agent player and the hacker player can sit at home in front of their own console or PC. Each player only sees their part of the game, so communication via headset is vital.As you might expect of a hacker, Alistar stays at his computer to work on high-tech tricks. He can see Angel on surveillance cameras and help her to penetrate secure areas.Angel, on the other hand, is out in the world, searching for clues and tracking down codes. The adventure can only succeed if both characters work well together.Another special feature of the game is that the roles of hacker and agent can be swapped around at any time.The game is available for PCs and the Playstation 5, and costs around US$15 (RM63). – dpa"

The Leger poll put the third-place left-leaning New Democratic Party at 19%.Trudeau, 49, called an early election, seeking to convert approval for his government's handling of the pandemic into a parliamentary majority.

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",10:38 PM MYT,Asean+,,Garment and footwear industries struggle during pandemic in Vietnam,"HANOI, Sept 18 (Vietnam News/ANN): Textile, garment and footwear industries are still facing many difficulties due the Covid-19 pandemic, and unable to recover production and business in the short term.These are large industries that have contributed large parts to the national export value and provided jobs for many workers.However, many localities are implementing pandemic preventive measures, especially in southern cities and provinces where enterprises are suffering serious impact from the pandemic on production.A large textile and garment enterprise with about 5,000 employees has had to suspend production for a month. However, it still has to pay VNĐ17.5 billion per month in depreciation expenses, insurance premiums for employees, bank loan interest and Covid-19 testing of employees. This figure includes air freight for urgent orders and salaries of employees though workers stay at home.Meanwhile, a footwear enterprise with about 9,000 employees has spent US$1 million to implement anti-pandemic measures. It has also faced increased input costs of 5-10 per cent.However, garment and footwear enterprises said the highest cost was still fines for late delivery. If the delivery of products is delayed, besides higher transport costs by plane, they could be fined hundreds of billions of đồng. Along with that, they would not be able to receive orders for the next season.In order to keep orders for production next year, Phan Thi Thanh Xuan, general secretary of the Vietnam Leather, Footwear and Handbag Association, said many enterprises had found solutions to maintain production and ensure delivery.The association proposed a gradual recovery of production for the footwear industry. Initially, enterprises would resume about 30 per cent of capacity. Then, they would continue to gradually increase production capacity to 50-70 per cent.Xuan said the industry’s prospect was not positive until year end and possibly next year. Now, many enterprises were facing difficulties and could not continue production or meet set targets in production and business.Vu Duc Giang, chairman of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association, said that if the pandemic continued complicated development, textile, garment and footwear enterprises would be unable to maintain production and keep customers. This was a huge challenge for the textile, leather and footwear industries.""Besides that, workers at enterprises have also left large production centres in the south such as HCM City, Bình Duong and Dong Nai, to avoid the pandemic, causing enterprises to have a serious labour shortage,"" Giang said.According to the Vietnam National Textile and Garment Group, an important issue is to ensure human resources in the context of changed production plans, shortages of Covid-19 vaccines and an unpredictable pandemic.The Ministry of Industry and Trade said the industrial production index of the whole industry in August was estimated to decrease by 4.2 per cent month on month and 7.4 per cent year on year.Export turnover decreased by 9.2 per cent for textiles and garments and 38.5 per cent for footwear year on year.In order to restore production of the textile, garment and footwear industries, the ministry would focus on removing difficulties and providing support for factories to maintain and restore production.Initially, solutions would aim at completing signed export contracts and attracting more orders for the year-end shopping season in the European and US markets. - Vietnam News/ANN"

""As a kid growing up this was the first step that you looked to.""I used to come and watch the games from the inaugural season and it was something that when the opportunity came I was interested in taking it.""I know Richie as well from a long time ago, also being in the national team, so that was good, someone I was familiar with and that I knew I would be happy working with.""Jones brings trophy-winning experience with him to a Perth side that finished a disappointing ninth in the 12-team A-League set-up last year.He picked up a pair of League Cup winners medals at Middlebrough and Liverpool while serving as understudy to Mark Schwarzer and Pepe Reina respectively before establishing himself as first choice goalkeeper with Feyenoord.The goalkeeer played 32 times for the Rotterdam club as they won the Dutch title in the 2016/17 season before earning a Dutch Cup winners medal a year later.Jones followed that with a move to Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr in 2018, where he helped the Riyadh-based side win the Saudi Professional League title for the first time in four years.""Over the past few years I've selected where I've gone and I've been fortunate from my time at Liverpool...the club became successful and I wanted more of that,"" he said.""But I wanted to be out there playing.

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",11:00 AM MYT,Tech,ANDREAS KOETTER,What to expect before buying an eScooter,"Electric scooters have taken over the streets of many a city, adding to the numbers of ways that people can cover short distances quickly. If you're in the market to buy one, instead of having to search out one to rent, there are a few factors to keep in mind.Who should buy one?""The purchase is worthwhile, for example, for commuters who want to use the e-scooter for the last mile,"" says Marcel Muehlich of Auto Club Europa (ACE). It's also good for running quick errands or other regular trips, such as going to the gym or going out for cigarettes.Lars Zemke, the chairman of the German Federal Association of Small Electric Vehicles, says that he uses his e-scooter for the last 2 kilometres of his commute and has actually saved time by doing so.The local rules on owning and riding your e-scooter should also be taken into account. In some countries, you may have to register your e-scooter or get a permit for it, not to mention insurance.What to do before buying?Muehlich lists just a few of the things potential buyers should keep in mind: ""A test ride is obligatory; well-functioning brakes are the be-all and end-all; and a model with the largest possible wheels minimises the risk of accidents due to potholes.""According to Zemke, some models now even offer turn signals.""The driver then no longer has to give a hand signal when turning, so the danger of losing balance is eliminated,"" he explains.Practicality should also not be forgotten as a factor in deciding on an e-scooter. The scooter's weight and ability to be folded play a fundamental role in how easy it's going to be to schlepp it around.If you want to use the e-scooter as part of your commute, every kilo is important if you're taking it on public transport or the train.And don't forget that the battery factors into the overall load.An e-scooter with an integrated charger means it doesn't have to be taken along separately, and a removeable battery is easy to replace, according to Muehlich.He also advises air tyres instead of solid tyres if you want a comfortable ride: ""They provide a better driving experience because they absorb vibrations better on uneven ground.""How much should it cost?""While inexpensive models can be bought at discounters for as little as 200 euros (RM982), ""You have to dig much deeper into your wallet for high-quality e-scooters equipped with pneumatic tyres, wide handlebars and a powerful battery, for example,"" says Zemke.That kind of model runs closer to 2,000 euros (RM9,822), according to Muehlich.However, he also advises against a cheap model. Keep an eye out for cheap-looking components, he says, and if the e-scooter feels at all wobbly, it's a good reason to refrain from buying that model. — dpa"

The wine is also exported to more than 45 countries.""Naoussa is the city of wine, the Burgundy of Greece as we call it here,"" said Naoussa mayor Nikolas Karanikolas.""This is an experiment and we will wait to see how the identity of the wine will evolve in these conditions.

In the past, nearly every house had its own vineyard.""We call Xinomavro 'the Barolo of the poor' but we are very proud of our products,"" said Petros Karydas, referring to Italy's sought-after wine.Karydas runs a small vineyard that produces about 12,000 bottles of wine a year, some of which are exported to Britain and the United States.But other challenges posed by the effects of a warming climate are more of a concern for wine industry professional Nana Chrysochoou than the results of the experiment.The winery set up by her father produces the only white wine placed in the water cellar and is from a local grape variety that he revived in his vineyards.""Year after year, we see climate change having an even greater negative impact on vineyards,"" she told AFP.""Especially this year, our plants went into a big shock due to the prolonged heatwave and drought.

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",12:30 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,"First, she was a survivor: #MeToo’s Tarana Burke tells her story","“Maybe it won’t catch on.”That’s what Tarana Burke was thinking — indeed, hoping — when she first found out the phrase “MeToo” was suddenly circulating online in October 2017, in the wake of shocking revelations about Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.It was a phrase she had come up with over years of working with survivors of sexual violence. And she worried that it would be co-opted or misused, turned into a mere hashtag for a brief moment of social media frenzy and ruining the hard work she had done.As it turned out, it did catch on. Actor Alyssa Milano had asked victims of sexual assault or harassment to share their stories or simply say #MeToo, and hundreds of thousands had done so on the very first day. But Burke’s fears did not materialise, and her movement has taken off in a way she’d never dreamed.“I wasn’t even dreaming this big,” she said in an interview. “I thought I had big, lofty goals and I didn’t dream nearly big enough.”Now, as the #MeToo movement — the social reckoning that began in 2017 — approaches its fourth anniversary, Burke, 48, has come out with a highly personal, often raw memoir of her childhood in the Bronx in New York City, her journey into activism, and the beginnings of #MeToo. She also provides a vivid account of how she herself was raped when she was only seven years old — an event that shaped her future in profound ways.Q: Why was it time for this memoir?Burke: People will think this is a book about, you know, going to the Golden Globes and meeting a bunch of celebrities, and a bunch of powerful men whose lives were impacted by #MeToo. I want to tell a different story. My story is ordinary and also extraordinary: It’s so many other little black girls’ stories, so many young women’s stories. We don’t pay attention to the nuances of what survival looks like or what sexual violence feels like and how it impacts our lives. So it just felt important. This is a story that’s been growing inside me for more than 40 years. It was time to give it a home outside of my body.What message do you hope to send other women and girls who, like you, experienced rape or sexual assault?That their experiences aren’t singular, and they aren’t alone. It feels really isolating, particularly if you’re dealing with sexual violence. I really want to convey the message that you are not alone. YOU are normal and the things that happened to you are NOT normal. It doesn’t make something wrong with you.You write about how you felt both guilt deep shame about what happened to you.Shame is insidious. It’s all-consuming. It can get into all the nooks and crannies and cracks and crevices of your life. There’s not enough messages that say, ‘This is not your shame to carry. This is not your burden to bear.’A key issue moving forward is the intersection of #MeToo and race. Have we moved forward as a society in that regard?We haven’t moved nearly enough. It became even more evident during the racial reckoning the country found itself in the last year or so. People cannot connect the two. Really, this is about advancing humanity. All of it is about liberation. And so Black lives have to matter. Women, people, have to have bodily autonomy. We need to live in a world that thinks about the environment and the actual space that we live in. All of those things are related to how we coexist as human beings. And we have to recognise that these systems of oppression we all live under affect us differently. I am Black and I am a woman and I am a survivor. And all those things exist at the same time.A very raw part of this book explores how when you were young, you felt ugly. You had to navigate those feelings. Did this experience help you to parent your own child?I was very worried about Kaia’s self-esteem. But then Kaia turned out to be this beautiful child, a physically beautiful child. And still in middle school she came to me and said, ‘I want Hannah Montana’s nose,’ and things like, kids were bothering them because they thought they were ugly. And I was just like, wow, it doesn’t matter what you physically look like. People will find ways to to tear you down. If they see the vulnerability and and parts of you that shine, they’ll take the lowest hanging fruit and try to take that from you.You describe how when #MeToo exploded in 2017, you were so afraid your movement, the work you’d done, would be co-opted. How did you get over that concern?Over time it became clear to me that whatever I’m supposed to do, whatever this assignment is that I’ve been given, it’s clearly an assignment for ME. And so if you take away how the world or the media describes #MeToo, what I built hasn’t really changed. I say this in the book: little Black girls in Selma and white women in Hollywood really need the same things. And I realised, nobody can take that away from me. I just became really comfortable. It may not ever look like it looked in October 2017. But that’s OK, because what happened in October 2017 was a phenomenal moment that we shouldn’t be trying to duplicate. We should be trying to build on that and do other things. So I don’t have that fear anymore. And it’s been an incredible journey of learning. — AP"

During the pandemic, many people miss dining in and travelling interstate for food hunts. Some homesick Malaysians who are stranded overseas miss the taste of authentic street food too. So I use colours to record the varieties of cuisine, feelings to describe time, lines to evoke appetite and taste. All these are used to describe the memory of taste,"" says Lui, 54.Known for his paintings of historical buildings, culture and heritage, the Negri Sembilan-born artist plays with the colours of street food in his 11th solo exhibition, Colour Of Taste, at Kuala Lumpur-based Pinkguy Gallery.It features a series of 12 oil on linen works, which can be viewed here.""There are 12 different scenes of 'taste' here, with each painting named after colours such as Blue, Turquoise, Yellow Ochre and Cobalt Violet. These paintings capture our favourite Malaysian street food: claypot chicken rice, bak kut teh, char kuey teow, lemang, nasi lemak and many more,"" he says.What is special about these paintings is that they have different visual effects depending on the lighting.""Some people think I just paint heritage buildings, scenes and people but that’s not it; the important thing is I am painting time, taste and feel. I use the contrast of colours and light because, for me, the atmosphere of a painting depends on the feeling and the taste, just like how the light and shadows on paintings have different effects. So although the painting is the same, the meanings are abstract as it changes as seen at different times by different people,” he says.Lui shares that the idea for this series came about at the end of 2020 when the country was dealing with movement control order (MCO) restrictions, a muddle of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and a spike in Covid-19 cases.""As a photography enthusiast, I captured the scenes using my camera while taking away food or walking amid the food stalls. Then I sketched and painted using my colours and other elements to describe my feeling and taste for each of the cuisine and street food,"" he says.He describes Malaysian food as intriguing, a melting pot of flavours, ingredients and techniques.""There are Chinese and Indian influences as well as Malay, and it can be confusing, at least initially. That is what makes Malaysia unique; not only its culture and heritage but also its multi-ethnic cuisine that is known to people across the globe. That's how I express my love towards Malaysian food through paintings,"" he says.Lui's artistic journey started in 1987 when he pursued his diploma in art and design at the Kuala Lumpur College of Art.His artworks mainly focus on architecture buildings from historical states like Penang, Melaka as well as Kuala Lumpur, which highlight the need to preserve historical landscapes in the midst of a rapidly urbanising city.He often spends about two to three weeks working on each painting.""For example when I draw buildings, I need to know the history behind the building such as when it was built and what its function was. In visiting these heritage buildings, I get to discover their beauty and add some of my own element in my artwork,"" he adds.The online exhibition, which also marks Lui's latest attempt in creating smaller art pieces, will run till Sept 29. – Bernama"

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",1:05 PM MYT,Lifestyle,CHESTER CHIN,Various reactions from Malaysians over Langkawi tourism bubble,"The Langkawi tourism bubble will surely provide a much needed respite for Malaysians who are keen to pursue their wanderlust again after months of travel restrictions.One such person is K. Aruna who immediately looked up travel booking platforms after it was announced that the tourism pilot project has been given the green light.“Before the pandemic, I would take two weeks off in a year to travel to some place new. Now, I’m grateful if I get to travel anywhere at all, even if it’s a domestic destination that I have been to before,” she said, adding that her last trip to Langkawi was in 2017.The sales executive said she has been keeping a close tab on the tourism bubble news since it was first mentioned last month. She is glad the government decided to go ahead with the initiative.ALSO READ: Time to focus on Malaysian healthcare travellers amid the pandemicWhile Aruna is excited to travel again, she only plans to go to Langkawi in either November or December.“I’m waiting for the hype to die down first. I’m sure many people will be visiting the island in the first few months and many places (of attraction) would be packed,” she said.It’s worth noting that tourists who are planning to travel by land would need to to use the services of travel agencies.“They will need to at least use the transport services provided by travel agencies from their respective starting destination to the jetty in Langkawi,” said Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri during a press conference.She added that travel agencies will help tourists to apply for permit from the police to travel to Langkawi.Meanwhile, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin recently clarified that tourists flying into Langkawi will not need a police permit.“For the Langkawi pilot tourism programme ‘travel bubble’, a letter from the police was only for the purpose of interstate travel and roadblocks if they are travelling by land,” he tweeted.On social media, Twitter user Freyr hopes the tourism bubble will breathe new life to Langkawi’s ecotourism attractions.“Saw that a lot of people are planning to go to Langkawi. Please visit ecotourism places like Kilim Geoforest Park, Machinchang Cambrian Geoforest Park and the Dayang Bunting Marble Geoforest Park.“By going to these places, you would be supporting conservation and communities,” he tweeted.That being said, the Langkawi tourism bubble has also courted some mixed reactions on social media.“I can’t visit my parents in Negri Sembilan but I can go holiday in Langkawi? Is this a joke? Make it make sense,” said Sharifah Hani Yasmin on Twitter.She subsequently suggested that she might just book a trip to Langkawi for her parents so that the family could reunite there.Some travel stakeholders have admitted that the tourism bubble will not be a foolproof plan. The project is not meant to guarantee zero Covid-19 cases, said Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) chief executive officer Yap Lip Seng.“We have learnt from other similar initiatives such as the Phuket Sandbox (in Thailand), and it is crucial to understand that the initiative is not meant to be foolproof – it is not meant to be perfect.“It will not guarantee zero Covid-19 cases (whether in or out), but what it is, instead, is an exit plan to live with Covid-19, having understood that it will not go away,” said Yap in an interview.Meanwhile, housewife Mary Kwan is less than thrilled about the tourism bubble in Langkawi.“A holiday is the last thing on my family’s mind now. We are still seeing so many cases reported daily,” she said.According to Kwan, she would rather not take any chances. Besides, she believes that the island resort will be packed with tourists in the first few months following the implementation of the pilot project.“Let the other tourists have all the fun first. For now, I am still more comfortable staying at home and away from crowded places,” she concluded."

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",3:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,CURTIS LAWSON,7 hunting dogs that make good house pets,"If you love to hunt, chances are you’ve hunted with dogs before and have perhaps considered investing in your own as well. This is especially true if you love hunting waterfowl, wildboar, or squirrel. But you probably don’t want to have a dog that has to be kennelled at all times and is at high risk for running off on their own. Rather, you want a dog that makes a good pet as well, and is a constant companion.Most dog breeds have hunting in their bloodline somewhere but not all dogs make good hunting dogs, and not all hunting dogs make good companion dogs. You want to look for a breed that is both loyal and willing to follow directions, as well as have a prey drive for usefulness in the field. Take a look below at some of the best breeds for this purpose.What to look for in a hunting dogWhen you are looking for a dog that you can use as both a great hunting dog and as a good house pet, you want to think about the purpose of a hunting dog first, and then look for those traits that provide the loyalty and love you are seeking in a pet.First off, you need to provide professional training to your pet. The dog needs to know how to listen well and follow commands to help overcome their high prey and hunting skill drive. This training will also make them a calmer, more conducive pet for the home.Most hunting dogs fall into one of four types of categories: scent hounds, pointers and setters, flushing dogs, and retrievers. All can make excellent pets as well as become expert at their jobs in the field. Your responsibility is to provide consistency through training to make it happen.Hunting dog historyHumans have been fascinated with dogs for approximately 20,000 years, and have used them as domesticated companions for hunting and protection in a manner that has benefited both species. Today, there are more than 30 recognized hunting breeds out of almost 200 breeds overall, making up a huge part of why people still pick hunting dogs today.A good dog can serve as a guard animal, pack animal, companion, and provide hunting benefits. With selective breeding spanning back 9,000 years, it isn’t odd to assume that humans quickly learned to watch for specific traits for specific needs.Hunting dogs today can: Track and hunt animals; find wounded game; scent and flush (the dog searches your surrounding area, and is able to quickly get any animal, like birds, out of hiding and up into the air); and retrieve downed game from a variety of situations.We’ve compiled the top seven hunting dog breeds that are also considered beloved house pets as well. These pups do require time and care for them to reach their full potential, but all are amazing companions.1. Labrador RetrieverBred for water retrieving, the Labrador Retriever has become a favourite household breed that exhibits a gentle, protective nature with children and showcases a high intelligence. Still popular in hunting trials, the Lab is a loyal option that will work by your side both day and night.2. GoldendoodleThis crossbred, designed breed brings the best of the Standard Poodle and Golden Retriever together to create a hypoallergenic, non-shedding dog that excels both in the home with children and in the field working as a hunting dog. Incredibly affectionate, they are easy to train and make a great companion.3. Golden RetrieverIt’s quite possible there are more Golden Retrievers getting fat as family dogs than being hunted with, but this docile, gentle breed is incredibly loyal, intelligent, and bred for competitive retrieving. Because of this, they are an amazing choice for families with children.4. German Shorthaired PointerPopular as a family pet, the German Shorthaired Pointer is an intelligent and playful breed that will work all day pointing and flushing, and curl up and protect your family all night. Their high energy is part of their genetics to help them keep going in the field, but it also allows them to be a wonderful running and walking companion.5. Brittany SpanielEager to please, the Brittany Spaniel is known for their excellent bird-hunting skills and is widely used in highly competitive shooting trials. This loyalty pays off in other arenas as well, and helps them be an amazing companion animal that is highly intelligent and always looking for ways to please their families. Just be aware they have a lot of energy and want to be by your side at all times.6. WeimaranerLoyal, friendly, and great with children, this sleek, shorthaired dog is known for its goofy personality and silver grey coat. Perfect for all around hunting options, they are amazingly intelligent and have a ton of energy that you can focus through consistent training.7. Jack Russell TerrierFriendly, playful, and pint-sized, the Jack Russell Terrier is easy to train and work with, but does have a lot of energy that needs to be directed towards a purpose. Incredibly intelligent, they learn fast and are great for both tracking and varmint-hunting, and have made their mark in fox-hunting as well.ConclusionChoosing a dog breed for both hunting purposes and as a companion is not too hard to do when such awesome breeds exist. These are only a few of the best, but they are excellent companions and make amazing family dogs.Curtis Lawson makes his home in Florida, the United States. Along with shooting sports, he and his family also participate in other outdoor activities, such as boating and fishing."

""We're already working much deeper into the tiered supply base because generally General Motors doesn't buy chips (directly) but (our suppliers do). But now we're building direct relationships with the manufacturers.""A GM spokesman declined to comment further on how the company might shift its supply chain.Next week, the White House and the U.S. Commerce Department plan a meeting on the chip crisis, which has caused production cuts by automakers around the world.On Thursday, GM said it was cutting production at six North American assembly plants due to the shortage.Earlier this month, the company was forced to temporarily halt production at most North American assembly plants because of the shortage.Chrysler parent Stellantis NV said this week it was cutting additional production at three plants in the United States and Canada because of the shortage.Barra said Friday the issue is a ""solvable problem, but it's going to be here a little longer.""The GM CEO, interviewed by Delta Air Lines chief Ed Bastian as part of a series of discussions with fellow CEOs, said some newer GM vehicles have up to 30% more chips than other vehicles.""As customer needs are shifting, we need more and more semiconductors,"" Barra said, saying GM was looking for short-, medium- and long-term solutions to the shortage.Last week, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson reaffirmed the automaker's 2021 profit outlook and said the company expects a ""more stable year"" in 2022 for semiconductor supplies.Jacobson cautioned GM's third-quarter wholesale deliveries could be down by 200,000 vehicles because of chip shortages and because GM shifted production into the second quarter as it managed semiconductor supplies.(Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jonathan Oatis)"

We rely on them to get our rooms filled. If we use these agencies, our profits drop by almost 60% to 70%"" he said.Sri Ganesh also said that customers were also preferring to opt for non-hotel condominium or residential units, where there was no need for operating permits or business licenses.He added that they did not have to pay any taxes to the government and hoped that the matter could be addressed in the upcoming 2022 budget."

[L1N2QK05U]The All Blacks' fourth successive win in the competition knocked out Australia and Argentina, while South Africa will need to capture big bonus-point wins over the New Zealanders in the last two matches to deny them the silverware.Australia and Argentina's remaining clashes will be dead rubbers but Wallabies fans will be pleased with the improvement shown under coach Dave Rennie.""I’m really proud of our guys because we wanted to back up last week’s performance with another good one,"" he said.""A lot of courage tonight and pretty clinical when it counted.”RUNNING GAMEHaving upset the Springboks 28-26 on the Gold Coast on Sunday courtesy of a Quade Cooper penalty after the siren, the Wallabies' running game shone in the Lang Park twilight as centre Len Ikitau and winger Marika Koroibete each scored two tries.Koroibete's second put the Australians 13 points clear with 12 minutes left and the home side defended brilliantly to shut down the contest, winning two turnovers in front of their posts.South Africa managed one try, through centre Lukhanyo Am shortly after halftime, but drew two yellow cards in a flat performance.Following back-to-back drubbings by New Zealand, Australia have clicked into gear with inside centre Samu Kerevi transforming their attack after returning from Japan.They have now risen to third in world rankings.South Africa coach Jacques Nienaber apologised to fans, calling it his side's worst performance since a 32-19 loss to Argentina in Mendoza in 2018.""We were really beaten. We got hands-down beaten in everything - defence, kicking game, attack,"" he told reporters.""This isn’t a performance that was worthy enough for (the) Springboks.""Michael Hooper was at his tireless best as the openside flanker notched up a Wallabies record 60th cap as captain, breaking George Gregan's mark.The only sour point for the hosts was a broken arm for fullback Tom Banks sustained in a tackle with South Africa winger Sbu Nkosi.SCRAPPY STARTSouth Africa were scrappy from the start, and scrumhalf Faf de Klerk was yellow-carded early for slowing the ball in a ruck.Ikitau was quick to capitalise with Australia's first try in the 14th minute, taking a cut-out pass from scrumhalf Nic White to burst through two tacklers in a 10-metre dash.Barnstorming prop Taniela Tupou then crashed through to set up Ikitau's second, with a Koroibete off-load putting the centre over at the right corner.Australia flanker Lachie Swinton was yellow-carded for a high tackle on Duane Vermeulen, and South Africa rallied to a 15-12 deficit at halftime after four penalty goals from Handre Pollard.Two minutes after the restart, the Springboks snatched the lead through Am's try after he ran onto a De Klerk grubber kick at the right corner.Cooper regained the advantage for Australia with a penalty before Koroibete took control with a two-try burst in six minutes.Taking an audacious flick pass from Tupou, Koroibete bolted down the left to cross in the 62nd minute.A Reece Hodge turnover followed by a Kerevi off-load to Pete Samu led to Koroibete's second on the same wing before Australia's defence took over to complete the confidence-building win.(Reporting by Ian Ransom in Melbourne; Editing by David Holmes and Ken Ferris)"

In addition, almost half of respondents feel that the stimulus measures and Covid-19 spending by respective governments did not contribute to a green recovery.ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute conducted the second iteration of its South-East Asia Climate Outlook Survey from June 11 to August 2.Designed to gather insights on the perspectives of South-East Asian citizens towards a variety of climate change issues, the online survey covered topics including climate change impacts, urban mitigation and adaptation, low-carbon transitions and partnership on climate action.It drew a total of 610 responses from citizens of all Asean member states, and its findings provided a general sense of the prevailing views of Southeast Asian citizens towards climate change issues.About a third of respondents identified the European Union (EU) as having demonstrated global climate leadership, but a substantial portion felt that no country had fulfilled the role of climate leader.However, when asked which country could potentially play a more proactive role in climate issues, respondents’ top three choices were the EU, Japan and the United States.At the regional level, Asean’s effectiveness in tackling climate action is in question as the majority of respondents question the regional organisation’s role in climate change.Commenting on the results, Director and CEO of ISEAS– Yusof Ishak Institute Choi Shing Kwok said, “This is the second year we have conducted the survey.The results show that South-East Asians believe that more should be done to address climate change issues, with a majority viewing climate change to be as much of a crisis as the Covid-19 pandemic.“Survey respondents also believe that better and more innovative climate change policies can result in higher economic competitiveness, which will translate into strong support for governments and private companies pursuing climate change initiatives in the region.”Coordinator of the Climate Change in South-East Asia Programme at ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute Sharon Seah said the survey confirmed that climate change remained top priority for Southeast Asia despite the ongoing pandemic.Respondents were unequivocal about the role of governments, businesses and individuals in reducing carbon emissions and the need to cut reliance on coal as soon as possible. This was accompanied by an emerging consensus on the potential of a renewable energy transition. - Borneo Bulletin/ANN"
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",6:17 PM MYT,News,STEVE GORMAN,SpaceX capsule with world's first all-civilian orbital crew set for splashdown,"(Reuters) - The quartet of newly minted citizen astronauts comprising the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission were due to splash down in the Atlantic off Florida on Saturday, completing a three-day flight of the first all-civilian crew ever launched into Earth orbit.To prepare for atmospheric re-entry and return to Earth, the SpaceX Crew Dragon vehicle completed two rocket ""burns"" on Friday to lower its altitude and line up the capsule's trajectory with the targeted landing site.The Dragon capsule, dubbed Resilience, is scheduled to parachute into the sea around 7 p.m. Eastern time, shortly before sunset, according to SpaceX, the private rocketry company founded by Tesla Inc electric automaker CEO Elon Musk.SpaceX supplied the spacecraft, launched it from Florida and flew it from the company's suburban Los Angeles headquarters.The Inspiration4 team blasted off on Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral atop one of SpaceX's two-stage reusable Falcon 9 rockets.Within three hours the crew capsule had reached a cruising orbital altitude of just over 363 miles (585 km) - higher than the International Space Station or Hubble Space Telescope, and the farthest any human has flown from Earth since NASA's Apollo moon program ended in 1972.It also marked the debut flight of Musk's new space tourism business and a leap ahead of competitors likewise offering rides on rocket ships to well-heeled customers willing to pay a small fortune to experience the exhilaration of spaceflight and earn amateur astronaut wings.The Inspiration4 team was led by its wealthy benefactor, Jared Isaacman, chief executive of the e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments Inc, who assumed the role of mission ""commander.""He had paid an undisclosed but reportedly enormous sum - put by Time magazine at roughly $200 million - to fellow billionaire Musk for all four seats aboard the Crew Dragon.Isaacman was joined by three less affluent crewmates he had selected - geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate Sian Proctor, 51, physician's assistant and childhood bone cancer survivor Hayley Arceneaux, 29, and aerospace data engineer and Air Force veteran Chris Sembroski, 42.Isaacman conceived of the flight primarily to raise awareness and donations for one of his favorite causes, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a leading pediatric cancer center in Memphis, Tennessee, where Arceneaux was a patient and now works.The Inspiration4 crew had no part to play in flying the spacecraft, which was operated by ground-based flight teams and onboard guidance systems, even though Isaacman and Proctor are both licensed pilots.SpaceX already ranked as the most well-established player in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures, having launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the space station for NASA.Two rival operators, Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc and Blue Origin, inaugurated their own astro-tourism services in recent months, with their respective founding executives, billionaires Richard Branson and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, each going along for the ride.Those suborbital flights, lasting a matter of minutes, were short hops compared with Inspiration4's three days in orbit.(Writing and additional reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Daniel Wallis)"
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",6:29 PM MYT,Asean+,,Cambodian leader Hun Sen is boasting he barged into opposition video call,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP): Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen (pic) has boasted of barging uninvited into a video conference call hosted by his political opponents.An enthusiastic user of social media, Hun Sen said that on Friday (Sept 17) he intruded into the Zoom call to warn his opponents that he and his spies were keeping a close eye on them.The Sept 9 call was held by former members of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, which a court dissolved in 2017.Cambodia's courts are widely seen as doing the bidding of Hun Sen's government, in this case eliminating the sole credible opposition party ahead of the 2018 election. The party had been expected to present a strong challenge to Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party, which instead swept the parliamentary polls.Clips of part of Hun Sen's sudden intrusion on the video call have been circulating on social media. They show Hun Sen holding a 12-minute conversation with Long Ry, a former opposition lawmaker.In their chat, Hun Sen complained that members of the former opposition party insulted him personally even though, he claimed, he had tried to promote a ""culture of dialogue.”A spokesman for Hun Sen’s party, Sok Eysan, initially denied that the intrusion and exchange had taken place, saying the video clip was a fabrication.Hun Sen, however, during a live television broadcast Friday opening a COVID-19 vaccination campaign for children, acknowledged the exchange and said he had listened in on about 20 previous calls of his opponents without revealing his presence or showing his face.He also wrote on his Facebook page about his exploit, stressing that he had not been reaching out to negotiate, but to warn them against disruptive activities.U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia quoted Long Ry as saying that Hun Sen was able to join the Zoom meeting because one of his team members shared the meeting link or password with others so they could listen. He said he would be happy to invite Hun Sen to future meetings to discuss national issues.""But morally, when people sneak a peak into our affairs, we are not happy,” it quoted Long Ry as saying. ""In politics, I think we should employ honest and straightforward methods, and not take advantages of others by secretly sneaking into their affairs.”Most senior members of the Cambodia National Rescue Party fled into exile after the party was dissolved. Hun Sen has been in power for more than 36 years and said repeatedly he has no intention of stepping down soon. Human rights groups and Western nations accuse his government of suppressing democratic and human rights.Crashing other people's Zoom conferences became a small fad last year when use of the application skyrocketed during the pandemic as many people began working at home. It is usually accomplished by obtaining a password, which is often casually circulated to invitees. - AP"

Meanwhile, those in the private sector were making as little as 8,000 pesos.And many have had enough: About 40 percent of private hospital nurses have resigned since the start of the pandemic, according to the Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines.More than 5,000 nurses have been given the green light to go abroad this year after a Covid-19 ban was replaced with a cap to ensure enough nurses were available in the Philippines.It hasn't worked.""We can't get additional nurses, we can't compel them to apply,"" said Jose Rene de Grano of the private hospitals association.- 'We feel exhausted' -In recent weeks, health workers have protested over unpaid benefits, including a coronavirus special risk allowance. Abenojar said many were still waiting.President Rodrigo Duterte has asked for patience while the government tries to come up with the money.""We don't feel cared for,"" said Melbert Reyes of the Philippine Nurses Association.Many hospitals boosted their bed capacity after a virus surge earlier this year threatened to overwhelm them.Official data show coronavirus ward and ICU bed occupancy rates at more than 70 percent nationwide as daily cases often exceed 20,000, fuelled by the hyper-contagious Delta variant.A public hospital in Binan city, near Manila, turned a car park into a ward.""Many of our nurses are sick and in quarantine,"" medical director Melbril Alonte told AFP.""We feel exhausted... but we always keep in mind that we have to help our people because... no one else will.""But due to the nursing shortfall, some facilities -- like the Lipa Medix Medical Center -- have had to slash their bed capacity, and extend their nurses' shifts.Nurse Trixia Bautista said she works up to 15 hours per shift looking after mostly severe Covid-19 patients at a public referral hospital in the capital.At times, she has cared for as many as 30 patients on her own after nurses on her ward quit or got sick.""Physically it's very tiring,"" she said. ""There's not enough people to cater to all these patients.""- 'Not worth being a nurse' -But there are plenty of qualified nurses in the Philippines, said Abenojar of Filipino Nurses United.She estimated 200,000 to 250,000 were not working in the sector.Many healthcare workers enter the profession to try to secure better-paid jobs abroad, but the shortage is not due to overseas migration.""It's because nurses have left the profession,"" said Yasmin Ortiga, assistant professor of sociology at Singapore Management University, pointing to the dearth of stable jobs and dismal wages.A proliferation of nursing programmes led to an oversupply, with many unable to get a permanent position in a local hospital -- necessary to work abroad -- and subsequently a drop in enrolments.Ortiga said: ""People realised that if I am unable to leave the country it's really not worth being a nurse at home."" - AFP"

For one things, the vast majority of cars don't have webcams, while dispaying video footage on a screen for the driver is banned in many places.The new car feature is limited to Apple users for now, however. While Android Auto already has some compatability with Microsoft Teams, this is limited to receiving chat notifactions. – dpa"

Places deemed to be of lowest risk of Covid-19 infections are grouped in Category I.Travellers from Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China and Taiwan only need to undergo a PCR test on arrival and are free to move about if the result is negative. Countries of highest risk are grouped in Category IV.MOH said the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, France, Latvia, Portugal and Spain will be added to the Category III list of countries.From 11.59pm on Sept 22, fully vaccinated travellers from these countries may apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their homes or other suitable accommodations.Applications to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities will be considered if the vaccinated traveller has fulfilled criteria such as remaining in the respective countries for the last 21 days prior to arrival in Singapore, and is occupying their respective places of residence alone.For Singapore citizens and permanent residents, the application must be made three days prior to arrival via the SafeTravel website.Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to undergo a 14-day SHN at dedicated facilities.The other countries already in Category III are Austria, Belgium, Japan and Switzerland. Travellers from countries in this category will have to take six Covid-19 swab tests in total.“As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a Covid-19 resilient nation,” said MOH."

He added, “The prerequisites for success against all tribulations are unity, togetherness and being united in the interests of our tanah air.“We welcome the inclusive Malaysian Family concept that cuts across race and religion as one that wisely coincides with the principles we hold in driving the nation-building agenda and community development for the future.“At the same time, it has the potential of fostering these prerequisites amongst the rakyat in combating the Covid-19 pandemic.”“We pray for the well-being and safety of Malaysia and the rakyat in strengthening their resolve in making Malaysia Day a success with high patriotic spirit.

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",8:42 PM MYT,Asean+,,Bats in Laos caves found to carry coronaviruses that share key feature with Sars-CoV-2,"VIENTIANE, Sept 18 (Bloomberg): Bats dwelling in limestone caves in northern Laos were found to carry coronaviruses that share a key feature with SARS-CoV-2, moving scientists closer to pinpointing the cause of Covid-19.Researchers at France’s Pasteur Institute and the University of Laos looked for viruses similar to the one that causes Covid among hundreds of horseshoe bats. They found three with closely matched receptor binding domains -- the part of the coronavirus’s spike protein used to bind to human ACE-2, the enzyme it targets to cause an infection.The finding, reported in a paper released Friday that’s under consideration for publication by a Nature journal, shows that viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 exist in nature, including in several Rhinolophus, or horseshoe bat, species. The research supports the hypothesis that the pandemic began from a spillover of a bat-borne virus. About 1,000 such infections may be occurring daily in southern China and Southeast Asia in areas with dense populations of bats from the Rhinolophus genus, a study Tuesday found.The three viruses found in Laos, dubbed BANAL-52, BANAL-103, and BANAL-236, are ""the closest ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 known to date,” said Marc Eloit, head of pathogen discovery at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and co-authors. ""These viruses may have contributed to SARS-CoV-2’s origin and may intrinsically pose a future risk of direct transmission to humans.”The receptor binding domains of three Laos coronaviruses are closer to that of SARS-CoV-2 than to the RaTG13 virus identified in Rhinopholus affinis bats from the Mojiang mineshaft in Yunnan province, that was regarded as the pandemic strain’s closest match. The BANAL-236 virus has an almost identical receptor binding domain to the pandemic virus, according to the paper.""The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 looked unusual when it was first discovered because there were so few viruses to compare it to,” said Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney, who wasn’t involved in the research.Tracing Ancestors""Now that we are sampling more from nature, we are starting to find these closely related bits of gene sequence,” Holmes said in an email Saturday. ""Eventually, with more sampling, the natural ancestry of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome will be revealed.”None of the bat viruses isolated in Laos harbors a so-called furin cleavage site in the spike that facilitates cell entry. It’s a feature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has led some scientists to theorize that it was created in a laboratory.No evidence supporting the lab-leak theory has emerged. Last month, the U.S. intelligence community ruled out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was developed by China as a biological weapon, but no consensus was reached on its origin.The lack of furin cleavage may be explained by insufficient sampling in bats, or by acquisition of the furin cleavage site during chains of transmission in an alternate animal host, or during unreported circulation in humans in the early stages of the outbreak when the virus may have caused few symptoms, the authors said.""Our results pinpoint the presence of new bat sarbecoviruses that seem to have the same potential for infecting humans as early strains of SARS-CoV-2,” they said.Guano CollectorsPeople who spend time in or close to caves, such as guano collectors, are particularly at risk of being exposed. Further investigations are needed to assess if people exposed to bats have been infected by one of these viruses and whether they have antibodies that may provide protection against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infections.""This paper is really interesting and we need more research like it,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s technical lead for Covid-19, in an email.The researchers studied 645 bats from 46 species captured on four sites -- in Fueng and Meth districts of Vientiane province, and in Namor and Xay districts in Oudomxay province -- between July 2020 and January 2021. The bats live in the limestone karstic terrain common to China, Laos, and Vietnam in the Indochina peninsula.The paper highlights the diversity of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses present in bats in Southeast Asia, Holmes said.""Continual sampling is the only way to understand the origins of this virus and it is important that more sampling is done throughout China as this remains the most likely place of origin,” he said. ""This study emphasizes that bat coronaviruses that have the potential to infect humans readily exist in nature and could emerge any point. This is the clear risk for the future.” - Bloomberg"

Only one Covid-19 positive individual was identified through RTK-Ag at KLIA2. The Category 1 positive case was given a ten-day quarantine Home Surveillance Order (HSO),” Dr Noor Hisham said in the ministry’s daily Covid-19 updates.Entry into Langkawi is only by sea and air, and authorities are ensuring only fully vaccinated tourists who have been screened for Covid-19 can set foot on the island. The travel bubble began on Thursday (Sept 16).There were 15,549 new cases in total on Saturday, bringing Malaysia cumulative Covid-19 case number to 2,082,876.However, there were also 17,205 recoveries nationwide for a total of 1,840,453 recoveries to date.Dr Noor Hisham said there are 1,165 cases needing treatment in intensive care units (ICU). They comprised 888 Covid-19 patients and 277 suspected, probable and cases under investigation.Of those in ICUs, 689 require ventilator support.Dr Noor Hisham said that of the new daily cases, 263 cases (1.69%) were from categories 3, 4 and 5, while 15,286 cases (98.31%) were from categories 1 and 2.Category 1 means a patient is asymptomatic. Category 2 is for those with mild symptoms.Category 3 cases experience pneumonia, while cases in Category 4 have pneumonia and require oxygen. Category 5 patients are in a critical stage requiring ventilator support.Of Saturday's new cases, five were imported cases while 15,544 were local infections.Sarawak recorded the most cases with 2,929 new infections, followed by Johor (2,208), and Selangor (1995).Only three localities reported less than 100 infections on Saturday - Perlis with 33, Putrajaya (31) and Labuan (11).The latest data by the Health Ministry also showed that the Covid-19 infectivity rate or R-naught (Rt) in Malaysia was 0.95, with Sarawak registering the highest at 1.11, followed by Terengganu (1.05) and Perak (1.04). The states with the lowest recorded Rt are Selangor (0.85), Kuala Lumpur (0.81) and Labuan with a zero Rt.The R0 of a virus is a measure of its transmission or number of new infections generated by each case.

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",8:45 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Watch: Zimbabwean artist turns worthless old Mugabe-era banknotes into paintings,"If anyone doesn't need reminding that banknotes are just worthless pieces of paper, it is Zimbabweans: more than a decade ago, they watched as hyperinflation obliterated their currency and led to the printing of a 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar note.Zim dollars were abandoned in 2009, after inflation caused by rampant money printing under the late President Robert Mugabe erased everyone's savings and pushed millions into poverty.Most bills ended up in the trash, but Zimbabwean visual artist Prudence Chimutuwah has found value in the unloved old bank notes - by using them to make art.Chimutuwah wants Zimbabweans to look beyond the ugly history of the inflation - considered by the International Monetary Fund as the worst of any peacetime country - to see something beautiful in the bills. And, in the process, perhaps recover from the trauma of that time.""A lot of people, when they see the old bank notes, their reaction most of the time (is to) get angry,"" said Chimutuwah.""I am trying... for people to see the beauty of these old bank notes. So, when someone looks at this artwork they go like 'whoa' and then they forget the pain this thing has caused.""Her paintings capture the daily lives of women, shown dancing, cooking or in bright and elegant dress, with the old Zim dollar notes stuck on with glue to form part of the image.Her figures are mostly blue, which she described as ""a symbol of strength and dominance"".In one painting, a woman pours a liquid from a calabash, which is made up of pieces of brown 1,000 and 50 billion Zimbabwe dollar notes. In another, a woman wears a mask and blouse made from purple 500 million Zimbabwe dollar notes. - Reuters"

This is further embodied with its wrist movement which enables the mechanism to run.An automatic watch that is powered by the energy of the person who wears it, the Powermatic 80 movement boasts 80 hours of power reserve, which is enough to continue telling time accurately even if the watch is not worn for some three days.For more information on Tissot PRX Powermatic 80, visit https://www.tissotwatches.com/en-my/tissot-prx.html or its website and follow them on Facebook."

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,"Many disabled music professionals feel unable to reveal their condition, study says","Disability remains a taboo subject in the music industry. This is the unfortunate finding of a new British consultation funded by the Arts Council England.The phenomenon is such that some professionals in the sector refuse to talk about their health condition or impairment for fear of reprisals.The study is based on the testimonies of several hundred artists and other professionals in the music industry. More than 70% of them identified as suffering from a disability (motor, neurological, sensory or cognitive) or a long-term health condition that is non-visible.Although this term covers a wide range of realities, most of the people concerned ""sometimes"" or ""never"" disclose their health condition to their colleagues.While two-thirds of the survey respondents believe that this information is not relevant in a professional context, many are worried about appearing less competent or facing discrimination.What's even more concerning is that one in four respondents worry about missing out on job opportunities because of their disability.""Some employers tried to make the accommodations I needed. One employer told me it was not their job. Another told me that I was lying and wanted to get disability (benefits),"" explains one respondent.Feeling like a burdenThe study also found that professionals with invisible disabilities put their health at risk by choosing not to disclose their health concerns in the workplace. Three-quarters of those surveyed reported this unfortunate experience.""I am getting better at asking for my needs, but in the past I often did not want to ask for too much and feel like a burden. As years have gone by and I have gotten more comfortable, this pattern has decreased,"" said one respondent.The vast majority of respondents, however, agreed on the need to give more prominence to people with disabilities in music.A previous report from the Arts Council England, dating from 2018, had already warned about their under-representation in all areas of the industry. At the time, the organisation found that only 1.8% of professionals in the sector had a disability.Ben Price, founder of Harbourside Artist Management, is one such professional. He himself has an invisible health condition, which helped motivate him to oversee this industry consultation.""With my own lived experiences, I was keen to embark on this research. I myself have a disability that I didn't feel able to disclose, and I wanted to explore the perspectives of others in a similar position, as well as solutions of what can be done to improve disabled representation in the music industry.""This aim is not necessarily to ask more people to disclose their disabilities, but to encourage an environment where those conversations are normalised and more people with a disability or long-term health condition can be welcomed into the industry – at all levels – without barriers."" – AFP Relaxnews"

My doctor drew my blood to test for antibodies and observed that I had low levels,” he said. The prime minister took his booster shot on September 14.Phnom Penh and Kandal province next month are collectively set to be the first region to make booster shots available to the general public aged 18 and over. Other provinces will later allow people to get a third dose four months after their last jab.The prime minister said Cambodia is also keeping tabs on global developments to determine whether a fourth dose is necessary, noting that the government would shoulder the costs of acquiring additional jabs as needed.“We have to keep an eye on this and follow pertinent developments around the world and the observed immunogenicity of an additional dose, as well as recommendations from the World Health Organisation.“I understand that one of our foreign allies has already started administering a fourth dose, but I don’t want to name the country,” Hun Sen said, in reference to Turkey. Israel has also placed a fourth dose on the table.The prime minister also signalled that he was keen to allow all businesses to reopen soon if the Covid-19 situation shows significant signs of improvement.“No one wants to see closures like this, our people want to go out. I first want to reopen the education sector, followed by the service industry ...

And China started using low-code in 2014,” she shares with a degree of enthusiasm.She took some time researching the potential market for a low-code platform in Malaysia and the region and in 2017, with funds taken out from her wedding budget, they kickstarted Orangeleaf Consulting.The company offers digital innovation services, specialising in Mendix Low-Code, to firms looking to digitalise their systems.Ng recalls that there was hardly any conversation in the market around low-code at the time and it was a challenge educating local tech talents on its application. They were also frequently turned away as companies were generally unsure about the concept of automating their operations then.However, Ng was convinced that low-code is the way to go to help companies with their digitalisation process.And given that it requires little coding, it was possible to build a system 10 times faster and with seven times fewer resources. For example, Orangeleaf built 15 applications for a local client with only two people on the project last year.“In a company, different departments will be using different software and they usually need to manually consolidate the data across. I believe Mendix can help them close that gap. And because we are a consulting firm, not a software house, we start off by helping clients build a digitalisation strategy before selling them the idea of using low-code.”Orangeleaf’s early clients signed on with them when they were shown the potential returns on investment. For its first customer, it built an entire system in two months, with three weeks of testing, at half the cost.Ng adds that the company does not offer off-the-shelf applications, preferring, instead, to help clients customise their systems.“It’s the build versus buy approach. If you buy something off the shelf, it’s harder to integrate that into your system. If you are a smaller company, buying off the shelf might work because it’s not something you want to bother too much with.“But if you have your own special features and you want to customise and build your own pipeline to enable the company to build systems internally, then we can help you (do that faster with low-code).“Clients need to look at what systems they can’t roll out fast enough to meet the market. And if they want to expedite that, they can leverage low-code. Mendix is all about getting the product out as soon as possible,” she says.While off-the-shelf applications may enable clients to immediately plug-and-play, she notes that building a system offers companies with more sustainable results.She also emphasises that Orangeleaf does not do long-term contracts, which are a norm in the software industry. Their projects are completed in days or months.“We come in to help them with complicated projects. However, in the long run, they can have their own internal people to build systems. Once the internal team familiarises themselves with the low-code environment, they can further build the systems later. This also helps them build their internal digital workforce.“Our vision here is to enable clients to digitise business by themselves. I really hope that Malaysia will one day be able to digitise things in the ecosystem that works, whereby nobody needs to go through a manual process in between two digital processes.”Given its flexibility in building various applications with low-code, the company does not focus on any one industry and serves clients in various sectors including manufacturing, construction and logistics.Ng adds that there is no limit to the number of solutions they can build. Notably, the company has seen tremendous growth of some 200% since the start of the pandemic as businesses look into every avenue to digitise their operations at the fastest pace and with the lowest cost possible.Enquiries from the local market have also picked up substantially with the growing acceptance of low-code.Currently, the bulk of its business comes from overseas markets like the Philippines, Japan, Germany and Australia.Correspondingly, the majority of their customer base are larger firms. SMEs, including startups, make up about 20% of Orangeleaf’s business.While there is plenty more that the company can do in the digitalisation space with rising demand, Ng wants to also look at the wider needs of the ecosystem.“After three years in the market, I noticed a high demand for low-code talent in Europe. People in Europe are looking to us for talent as we have the cost advantage. So our goal is to build a talent hub for low-code.“To have a healthy ecosystem, we need to build the supply of talent. So once our business stabilises, we want to roll out an academy in Malaysia to offer short courses on low-code by 2022,” she says.She adds that in the near term, more and more enterprises in the US and Europe will be using low-code given its accessibility.This may also encourage more women to join the tech workforce.“Low-code is very different from traditional programming. You need both the business and tech perspectives, and in this sense, I think women are better at seeing a balanced picture. But men and women have their own strengths and they actually balance out the development ecosystem quite well.“In the long run, I do see an increase in interest and I do encourage more women to explore tech and to take their learning into their own hands.”The return to tech has been unexpected, but Ng notes that it has also been a lot more interesting.“It has been a learning curve. But I do find IT more fun these days and I want to know more. I see tech very differently now. It is so much more incorporated into so many aspects of our lives. Technology has transformed our lifestyle,” she says.The road ahead is certainly promising for Orangeleaf as digitalisation trends continue to increase.For Ng, who has had a rough past year following a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, it is also a time of coming back on track and taking the opportunities ahead with gusto.“Nothing in life is easy. Everything you do is about the decisions you make and then going through the learning curve.“And every obstacle is an opportunity to grow. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it is that every status is not permanent.“I was an orphan. But now I see myself as a businesswoman and an entrepreneur. It takes a lot of perseverance, grit and patience.“If you learn the basics, you will go somewhere. And another piece of advice I can give is to not compare your life with others.“I overcame a hard life with gratitude and by picking my fights.”"
"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,MING TEOH,Living with Alzheimer’s: A time for learning and adjustment,"Seventy-eight-year-old Amy has Alzheimer’s disease, and she is cared for at home by her daughter Azlina. Her husband and domestic maid help as well.“I feel a deep sadness for the fate of my mum, but as a family, we’ve come to accept it as part of life. Mum is now totally dependent on us and she’s no longer able to communicate verbally,” says Azlina.“But we’re fortunate in some ways because she has been very gentle even in her most difficult moments and she still is. The hardest part was mainly handling our own emotions,” she adds.Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative brain disease caused by complex brain changes following brain cell damage. It leads to dementia symptoms that gradually worsen over time, with the most common early symptom being trouble remembering new information because the disease usually impacts the part of the brain associated with learning first.As it advances, the symptoms become more severe and include disorientation, confusion and behavioural changes. Eventually, speaking, swallowing and walking also become difficult.There is no way to prevent, cure or even slow down Alzheimer’s disease, especially when it’s diagnosed at a late stage.Caring for a loved oneAccording to Azlina, there are many things to consider when a family member is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease or any other type of dementia, things that she has learnt in the course of caring for her own mother.Firstly, it is a time of learning and adjustment for the whole family.“As with any chronic medical condition, everyone has to go through a period of trials and tribulation as we adjust and learn,” she says.“Since as family members, we’re taking on the bulk of the responsibility for caregiving, it’s important to educate ourselves about the disease and understand its effect on the person, as well as how the disease will progress so that we can prepare ourselves psychologically if not it will become very difficult later,” she adds.There is also the question of who will take on the responsibility of caregiver.“We’re a close-knit family so caring for mum personally was a natural choice. But if a parent-child relationship had issues before the onset of dementia, then caregiving can be difficult because both are adjusting to changing roles and needs. In those situations, it’s important to get help from others,” she says.When caring for the person with dementia at home, “dementia proofing” the home is necessary, says Azlina.Some ways of dementia proofing one’s home include: removing carpets or anything that can cause trips or falls because the person’s visual perception changes, installing handrails for bathrooms/toilets, making sure the bedroom and bathroom doors can’t be locked from the inside or that the key is easily accessible in case it does get locked, hiding the keys to the front and back doors of the house at night, and ensuring the gas tank is off when the kitchen is not in use.A lifestyle change with new activities would also be in order when a family member has dementia.“Understanding the disease is important and helps to put everything that happens into context. Find simple but meaningful activities to do together according to your family member’s changing ability. If the person is no longer able to engage in certain activities that they used to enjoy, then find new activities that the whole family can do together with them,” she says.Pandemic challengesAccording to Azlina, the pandemic and different stages of lockdowns hasn’t had much of an effect her mother since she’s at a very advanced stage of the disease and cared for at home (she doesn’t go out much).“But during her early stages, it might have been more difficult if she had to go through the pandemic then.”“This is because dementia patients are often restless and outdoor activities help to stimulate them, pass time and prepare their body for rest,” she says.“So, it’s especially difficult if they can’t go out and all the responsibility of ‘entertaining’ them rests on the caregivers within the walls of the home,” she explains.The pandemic also poses many challenges for persons with Alzheimer’s disease or other types of dementia who are still mobile and independent.“For some, the sight of masked people may cause them to feel scared or anxious.“If they’re outside and hungry, it’s not easy to just go to a restaurant and dine in during the MCO. So, they might have to wait and hunger is a major behavioural trigger.“Early closure of shops and pharmacies would also make it difficult for any emergency purchases like food, diapers or medicine,” she says.But one of the most difficult challenges would be not understanding the SOPs, especially if there isn’t a family member or carer to help them mediate any misunderstandings with members of the public, such as the need to queue or socially distance.“Individuals with early to mid-stage dementia who are still fairly independent may have issues with technology when they have to check in using the MySejahtera app every time they enter a shopping mall or other venue, and scan their temperature,” says Azlina.“If they’re not able to go out – like during the MCOs – the loss of social interaction is also likely to make them feel isolated and depressed,” she says.But despite all the negatives, Azlina says it’s important for caregivers to see things through positive eyes, and take things one day at a time.“Know your own limits as a caregiver and that it’s okay if things don’t go well all the time. Still celebrate the small victories and find humour in the simple things,” she advises.Being part of a support group so that one doesn’t feel so alone or overwhelmed in one’s journey as a caregiver is also important.“Talk to others, especially those who are also caregivers, about your feelings, and find a support group,” she says.For those based in Petaling Jaya and its surrounding districts, there is a support group based at the Atria Alzheimer’s Disease Community Centre.There is also a caregivers support group handled by the Alzheimer’s Disease Foundation Malaysia.During the pandemic, the support continues online through social media and networks such as WhatsApp and Facebook.“For example, in our support group, there is a chair yoga instructor called Janet who has been giving weekly online classes during the movement control order,” she says.“There are quite a number of smaller, more intimate support groups that exist too, usually around friends who are caregivers and living within the same area. So as a caregiver, it’s important to know you’re not alone in this and to get support,” concludes Azlina."

"Saturday, 18 Sep 2021",7:05 PM MYT,Asean+,ERIC NG,China’s carbon neutral goal: Beijing approves creation of power grid equipment giant to meet decarbonisation needs,"Beijing has given the green light for the formation through merger of a central government-controlled electricity transmission and distribution equipment giant, as part of a reform of industry and state-owned enterprises to drive efficiency.The move, which involves the consolidation of XJ Group and six units under dominant power distributor State Grid Corporation of China, will create a company with more than 100 billion yuan (US$15.5 billion) in assets according to state media reports.Some of the companies make products and supply software that enables the automation of power grid management, which enhances the distribution system’s capacity and flexibility to absorb intermittent renewable energy. This will help China meet its net zero carbon emissions goal by 2060 and fight climate change.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.“Stripping out the noncore businesses of State Grid and enhancing the competitiveness of the entire sector is a big topic under China’s power system reform,” said Dennis Ip, head of utilities and renewables research at Daiwa Capital Markets. “[This drives the company to] focus more on power grid operation, power supply, power trading and dispatch, and the construction of transmission and distribution projects.”The latest restructuring involves its distribution equipment businesses, which will result in the establishment of a yet-to-be named company under the supervision of the central government. It will absorb China XD Group and six State Grid units – XJ Group Corporation, Ping Gao Group, Shandong Electrical Engineering and Equipment Group, Jiangsu Nari Group Hengchi Electrical Equipment, Jiangsu Nari Turbostar Electric and Chongqing Nari-Bori Transformer.“As informed by XJ Group, and upon approval by the State Council, it is agreed that XJ Group will be merged with companies including China XD Group,” Hebei province-based XJ Electric said in a statement to Shenzhen’s bourse on Wednesday.Shanghai emissions contracts to start trading in July, using market prices to drive towards targetXJ Group is a provider of automation and grid management solutions. China XD is a Xian, Shaanxi province-based maker best known for its high-voltage switches, transformers and insulators. Henan province-based Ping Gao makes switch gear and circuit-breakers and Shandong Electrical is China’s largest power transmission equipment maker, focusing on transformers, towers, cables and wires. The three Nari units belong to State Grid and have different product focuses.Beijing embarked almost two decades ago on a “big-bang” reform with the break-up of former power behemoth State Power Corporation into five generation firms and two distribution outfits to drive efficiency and cut industry costs.State Grid, the larger of the two distribution firms, has been asked to gradually spin out its noncore operations – including some power plants – to promote a fairer and more competitive industry landscape.Non-fossil fuel capacity will soon surpass coal power’s, though much of it remains unused“By legally unbundling the electrical equipment makers from State Grid, it is probably easier for the regulators to verify the cost of investing and maintaining the transmission and distribution assets owned by State Grid, [which will facilitate] transmission and distribution tariffs setting,” said Lucas Zhang Liutong, director of WaterRock Energy Economics. “It will also provide a more robust market structure for fair competition to supply equipment and services to State Grid via competitive tendering processes.”However, Beijing is asking State Grid’s equipment makers to merge with its domestic competitor XJ Group, which may actually reduce competition in the domestic market, which is expected to grow substantially as huge grid investment is needed to absorb the fast-growing renewable energy output, he said.“My best guess is that the merger is to create a big equipment maker and service provider that can compete well in the overseas market, especially in nations targeted by Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative,” Zhang added.Shanghai’s new national carbon emissions trading platform unveils trading rules, sets stage for launchLittle financial data has been publicly disclosed by the groups that will be merged. However, four of their listed units – XJ Electric, Henan Pinggao Electric, China XD and Shaanxi Baoguang Vacuum Electric Apparatus – reported a combined revenue of 16.6 billion yuan, a net profit of 750 million yuan and total assets of 76.6 billion yuan in the first half of this year, according to stock exchange filings.More from South China Morning Post:China’s carbon neutral goal: Beijing sets ambitious hydropower storage goal to bolster wind, solar energy growthChina’s carbon neutral goal: Non-fossil fuel capacity will soon surpass coal power’s, though much of it remains unusedChinese utilities’ ambitious renewable energy targets raise questions about costs, deliveryChina should stop building more coal power plants soon, climate change think tank says ahead of Glasgow summitFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021."
