"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,RAZAK AHMAD,INTERACTIVE: How Malaysia’s fight against Covid-19 is progressing (updated weekly),"PETALING JAYA: A total of 3,330,436 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered under the country’s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme as at June 3.The vaccination rate has been rising for the past few weeks after getting off to a slow start and on May 27 the number of jabs given daily breached the 100,000 mark, with 107,340 doses administered.The vaccination programme started on Feb 24 with a target of covering at least 80% of the country’s adult population.The vaccination programme is being carried out in three phases.The first covers frontliners.The second which began on April 19 involves high-risk groups and those aged 60 and above.The rest of the Malaysian population aged 18 years and above will be vaccinated in the third phase, which is expected to start soon.Here’s how the states and federal territories are progressing:The following graph shows the percentage of Malaysia's population who have received at least one vaccine dose, versus others in Asean as well as South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and Taiwan.In terms of vaccine registrations, 12,584,422 people or 51.9% of Malaysia's population who are aged 18 and above have signed up as at June 2.There were significant spikes in registrations especially on May 2 - the first round of opt-ins for the AstraZeneca vaccine - and on May 26, when those below the age of 60 were allowed to book during the second round of opt-ins.The country recorded a total of 603,122 Covid-19 infections with 515,571 recoveries and 3,182 deaths as at June 4.Among Asean countries, Malaysia currently has the highest cumulative confirmed Covid-19 cases per million people, according to Oxford University's Our World in Data (OWID)website:In terms of Covid-19 deaths per million people among Asean countries, the OWID portal puts Malaysia third behind the Philippines and Indonesia as at June 3, 2021:One of the things health authorities and experts measure when trying to find out where things are headed is the infection’s reproduction number, called R0 (pronounced as “R naught”).The R value refers to the number of people that a person who has the coronavirus will infect.If the R value is 1 for example, it means that on average, one infected person will spread Covid-19 to one other individual.An R value higher than 1 means that the number of cases will increase.However, if the R value goes down, the disease will eventually stop spreading as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.Malaysia announced its first Covid-19 cases on Jan 25, 2020, involving three tourists who entered via Johor from Singapore on Jan 23.The number of cases then rose to 22 by Feb 16 last year, representing the first wave of cases.The second wave of cases began on Feb 27, 2020, followed by the third wave that began on Sept 20.The following is how the third wave of infections developed in each state and federal territory:"

"Wednesday, 02 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,DIYANA PFORDTEN,INTERACTIVE: More Covid-19 patients are being brought in dead – why this happens and what needs to be done,"PETALING JAYA: The number of people in Malaysia infected with Covid-19 but who were only taken to hospital after dying of the disease is going up at an alarming rate.In May alone, we saw 123 deaths that the Health Ministry categorises as “brought in dead” (BID). The figure represents 47% of the 261 BID cases recorded in the country this year.Health experts said a detailed study needs to be done to find out why this happening, adding that the trend could be due to two possible factors.The first is that some people infected with Covid-19 did not take their initial symptoms seriously, only to face a rapid deterioration in their medical condition and as a result died before they could be taken to hospital.The second possible reason could be the widespread presence of more virulent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes Covid-19.In any case, the experts said that the worrying trend underscores the importance of people closely monitoring themselves for any possible symptom and sticking to the standard operating procedure (SOP) such as social distancing and wearing masks when out, in order to better protect themselves.As at the end of May, Malaysia has recorded 2,796 Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic reached our shores last year, of which 293 or 10% were classified as BID.The majority of BID cases occurred in Sabah (29%), followed by Selangor (27.6%) and Kuala Lumpur (10.9%).While Sabah had more BID cases last year, this year saw Selangor recording the most number of such cases.In terms of age, most of the BID cases involved patients aged between 60 and 69 (24.2%), followed by those between 50 and 59 (20.5%) and the 70-79 age group (16%). The 30-39 age group made up 8.5% of the overall BID cases in the country.The youngest Covid-19 patient who was brought in dead, in Tawau Hospital on Nov 28,2020, was a four-year-old in Sabah.Most BID cases had a medical history of hypertension and diabetes. However, 31.7% or 93 of the cases did not have any record of medical illness.The Health Ministry said on May 28 that the rising number of BID cases involved three possible scenarios, with the first scenario comprising patients who did not undergo Covid-19 screening despite developing symptoms such as fever and cough.The second scenario involved confirmed Covid-19 patients who were found dead at home before they could be sent to a quarantine centre or hospital.""Scenario three involves patients who experience the loss of sense of taste and fatigue but did not take these symptoms seriously. The patient only rested at home and after a few days, was found dead,"" the ministry said in a tweet.Universiti Malaya epidemiologist Prof Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud said the rise in Covid-19 patients who are brought in dead to hospitals may be due to several factors, including newer Covid-19 variants which are more virulent, resulting in a more rapid deterioration in the patient’s condition.Another possible reason that the infected person failed to seek proper medical attention quickly enough is that they brushed off their initial symptoms as a common cold or minor cough.""Other factors may be due medical facilities being far away and not readily accessible, like in remote areas of Sabah and Sarawak,"" he added.In order to ensure infected persons receive the medical attention they need, Dr Awang Bulgiba stressed that a data analysis should be done to determine the type of patients who are likely to deteriorate.""Factors that can predict disease progression may be modifiable but the correct analysis needs to be carried out to find out what those factors are,"" he said.Dr Awang Bulgiba also proposed that an epidemiological analysis be combined with genomic surveillance to prevent the spread of new undetected variants that will be a threat to the community.“Hardly 0.08% of virus samples are being sent for genome sequencing, ” he said, describing the figure as “dismal.”The medical condition of home-quarantined patients should be monitored more closely through the possible use of mobile applications that would allow the process to be done remotely.Dr Awang Bulgiba urged the government to ramp up vaccination efforts to between 300,000 to 500,000 doses per day.""With half a million doses per day, the country can achieve herd immunity in just 100 days or within six months if we vaccinate at a rate of 300,000 doses per day.“However, the current rate is far below this number, so this is worrying,"" he added.Commenting on the increasing number of BID cases, Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman said a study involving animals in India has shown that the new coronavirus variant in that country is associated with more severe clinical manifestations.""We are still studying the clinical data, but I believe the new strains of the virus may play a role in the deterioration of the symptoms,"" she said, adding that there is the possibility of multi-strains infections but should be proven by more research and clinical data.Dr Malina said that among the risk factors of developing severe Covid-19 and deaths are undiagnosed chronic diseases or medical illnesses that can lead to an immunocompromised patient (having an impaired immune system).""Some of the factors include the person's compliance to put an effort to get and have the prescribed treatment, effort by the caretakers to help monitor the symptoms as well as the general attitude and practice towards SOP compliance,"" she said.She advised those who are infected to closely follow medical advice and to get help from others such as family members, neighbours or friends to keep tabs on them in case their condition worsens.Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy reiterated that delays in seeking medical attention, failure to recognise severe symptoms of Covid-19, and newer variants may have contributed to the rise in BID cases.""Issues of getting quick access to healthcare especially in the remote interiors in Sabah and Sarawak may also be a factor,"" he said.Dr Subramaniam said proper assessments and monitoring are key to reducing BID cases, with those infected needing to be properly educated on the various Covid-19 categories to know if their symptoms are worsening from mild or moderate to severe.""The CAC (Covid-19 assessment centre) would need to ensure more thorough assessments and the district health office would need to ensure all patients on home monitoring are checked on regularly.""The Health Ministry must also be clear on when a patient should seek care at a hospital's emergency department,"" he said, adding that the patient's family or caregiver will need to be on alert to call in for medical attention if symptoms worsen."

"Sunday, 23 May 2021",,News,,INTERACTIVE: SUFFERING IN SILENCE,"Suffering In SilenceHow the Pandemic is Affecting the Mental Health of Our ChildrenBY DIYANA PFORDTENNadia, a Form Five student, is the eldest among three siblings.Nadia is a composite character.She is drawn from descriptions by psychiatrists interviewed for this story, who were asked about the children – some as young as eight years old – in need of their help ever since the pandemic started.Adults are not the only people whose lives have been turned upside down by Covid-19.Children are also facing greater anxiety, depression and isolation due to school closures and sudden changes in their daily routines and interactions.Many are unable to cope but don’t know what to do and parents sometimes fail to notice that their children need help.The pandemic’s toll on the mental health of our school going children is a growing problem that parents and everyone in society need to pay more attention to, warn the experts.SOLS Health research and advocacy director Dr Arman Rashid said some of the mental health stressors experienced by children – exam stress, isolation from friends, anxiety about the future - are not unique to the pandemic but are escalated by it.SOLS Health research and advocacy director Dr Arman RashidDr Arman highlighted that the closure of schools means the lack of avenue for children to develop their socio-emotional needs besides fulfilling educational purposes.“Schools serve as an important support system for students with teachers and peers playing a role in their emotional wellbeing.“This important role of schools in the life of children was hampered during the pandemic. As a result, many children feel increasingly lonely, isolated and detached,” he said.Dr Arman pointed out the pandemic has also escalated uncertainty over future educational and employment plans, particularly for older students.“Generally speaking, all children have been affected by the pandemic but even more so for SPM/STPM students and those from B40 (bottom 40%) households,” he said, adding that burnout, exhaustion and anxiety over needing to perform well in exams escalated as students felt inadequately prepared.“The stress is higher for students from B40 families as many cannot get internet access, laptops or mobile devices for online classes, or access to devices. Many are also part of larger class sizes in school,” he said.Dr Arman highlighted that there are long-term implications of the pandemic for both mental health and education of students.“If students continue to face mental health stressors during this period, it can cause short-term and long-term problems in psychosocial functioning and day to day life, including academic performance, relationships, morale and others.“Though all children have been affected by the pandemic, coping is dependent on their own level of resilience and support system around them,” he said.Universiti Malaya Specialist Centre consultant psychiatrist Assoc Prof Dr Amer Siddiq Amer Nordin said he has been receiving a rising number of children between the age of eight to 12 years old who are in need of mental health support since the second movement control order.“Due to the pandemic, these children are learning online and parents who previously had control in terms of gadget time, now have very little control as it is the mandatory way of learning.“Kids are being exposed to higher degree of online time and we know that online time is a risk factor for online issues such as cyberbully,” he said.Universiti Malaya Specialist Centre consultant psychiatrist Assoc Prof Dr Amer Siddiq Amer NordinDr Amer noted that children, who lack understanding of the implication of their action, may resort to writing nasty things, photoshopping or calling names.“Because they were not taught on how to manage social media and have little understanding on how to regulate their emotions, these actions lead them to face emotional issues, mainly stress which then develops into depress mode.“Those without a support system will keep their problems to themselves to the extent that some develop depression and even harm themselves,” he said.Dr Amer highlighted that these children may display physical symptoms such as eating disorder, poor emotional control, deterioration in school performance or showing risk of self-harm.“To address this, parents need to teach their children what emotions are, name them and also validate them,” he said.Parents, added Dr Amer, need to bring their children for professional help if symptoms deteriorate as professional mental assessments can also reveal the child’s condition aggravated due to history of trauma, having divorced parents, medical comorbidities or drug or porn addiction.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), mental health conditions account for 16% of the global burden of disease and injury in people aged 10 to 19 years.“Half of all mental health conditions start by 14 years of age but most cases are undetected and untreated,” it said, adding that globally, depression is one of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents.WHO noted that the consequences of not addressing mental health and psychosocial development for children and adolescents extend to adulthood and limit opportunities for leading fulfilling lives.In Malaysia, the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2019 found that 424,000 children in the country were experiencing mental health problems.Dr Arman, who is also the former project manager of Humankind Buddy Bear, stressed on the need for children to have access to both formal and informal mental health support during the pandemic, including emotional support from teachers, parents and peers.“We must adopt a preventive approach, with parents and caregivers playing an important role in addressing emotional challenges faced by students.“Parents can help foster a supportive and positive environment for emotional expression and help-seeking at home.""This involves listening and acknowledging feelings of children beyond meeting their physical needs,” he said.Parents and caregivers, said Dr Arman, are best placed to see early warning signs of mental health stressors, including connecting with mental health professionals if there is persistent distress.He also stressed that children also need more proactive involvement and supervision during online learning.“Emotional check-ins with children are very important. Parents need to look out for early warning signs like difficulties in concentration, frequent headaches, fatigue, irritability or sleep disruptions to offer emotional support.“If there are early responses, we can avoid mental health challenges from escalating into long-term conditions in most cases,” he said.If emotional distress persists and children show signs of intense hopelessness, social withdrawal, being overwhelmed, self-harm tendencies or thoughts despite support from parents or caregivers, Dr Arman encouraged parents to seek professional help.Acknowledging the shortage of mental health professionals, especially those specializing in supporting children, he said community stakeholders - parents, teachers, caregivers, social workers and others – need to be equipped with mental health skills and tools.“This has to go beyond general awareness to provide emotional support, assess needs and refer to formal resources if needed. In most cases, early interventions can prevent mental health conditions in the future.""In the case of counselling, Dr Arman said there needs to be more of a focus on child-centred creative, expressive and play therapies in professional help, in addition to online support like Malaysia’s only child-dedicated helpline during the Covid-19 crisis, Buddy Bear, in helping children handle emotions and coping skills.“This is because children communicate differently than adults. This means we need to provide a range of services catering to children - psychosocial helplines, online platforms, peer support groups and professional help from counsellors and psychologists.“The bottom line is we need more mental health professionals specialising in supporting children,” he said, adding that inclusive access to mental health services is even more important for the B40 group and rural communities.According to data from 2018, there were 410 psychiatrists in our country with a national average of 1.27 psychiatrists per 100,000 population, which is much lower than the WHO's recommended ratio of one psychiatrist per 10,000 population.Dr Arman noted that SOLS Health-Thrive Well has an ongoing programme called Keluarga Akrab Mencapai Impian (KAMI)m which work with PPR communities to engage children and parents at the community level in preventing escalation of mental health challenges, improving relationships and developing emotional resilience.“SOLS Health-Thrive Well, with the support of Yayasan Hasanah and Ministry of Finance, is also offering the Jom Sembang project providing subsidised mental health care, particularly for B40 communities, including children,” he said.An English teacher at a school in Jerantut, who only wanted to be known as Farhan, said students, especially SPM candidates in the school he teaches in, were having a hard time coping with online learning due to poor internet connectivity.“We could only conduct lessons via WhatsApp where I would send pictures and voice note to explain the lesson.“Even then, only a few students would respond to the lessons and out of 20 children, only around four students would participate in the lessons and they are usually the same person,” he said.Farhan also said the students reported facing a lack of motivation, were preoccupied with housework or caring for their younger siblings, as well as a lack of supervision from parents.“When they return to physical classes, we will need to teach them from scratch. It was particularly challenging for SPM candidates who needed to catch up.“The higher-ups often push teachers to use Google Meet and advanced online learning tools but often neglect the accessibility of students in rural areas.“The fact is, there are many children who are left behind in their studies, face difficulties in online learning, as well as stress and isolation during the pandemic and this will definitely affect their future plans and to an extent,their emotional and mental health” he said.Those in need of help can contact Befrienders at befrienders.org.my/centre-in-malaysia or call 03-7627 2929; Talian Kasih at 15999 (24 hours); and Lifeline (Mandarin) at 03-4265 7995.Story: Diyana PfordtenIllustrations: Foo Chern HwanEditing: Razak AhmadVisualisation: Sim Leoi LeoiTOPBuilt with Shorthand"

"Sunday, 16 May 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,REBECCA RAJAENDRAM,INTERACTIVE: Teachers a class above in difficult times,"TOUGH times call for strong characters, especially if you are a teacher trying to educate students living in hard-to-reach areas during a pandemic.Though schools had to close when the movement control order (MCO) began, education was not brought to a halt.It is easy for a teacher to teach when the conditions are ideal - the classroom is comfortable, there are enough tables and chairs, every student has a book, stationery and can they see the board clearly.But in rural schools, more often than not, the situation is far from ideal. Little, if at all, is readily available.The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) secretary-general Harry Tan said it was passion and responsibility that drove these teachers to do everything within their power to carry out their duty.With the closure of schools, teachers had to get creative and find novel ways to deliver their lesson modules to their students, he told The Star.Some of those who taught in the interiors would travel by jeep, boat and foot to reach their students at their homes to give modules and learning packs.Others would brave bad weather to personally hand deliver assignments to their charges.Click on the icon on the pictures below to view each teacher's storyEven though these were not as effective to teach compared to face-to-face learning, these teachers believed that this would be enough to keep the students from missing out.Sabah Teachers' Union (STU Sabah) vice-president Susan Atau said online learning was a “huge challenge” for her and her rural students last year.She said her students did not have any digital devices and, coupled with an “extremely hopeless” Internet connection, she could not finish the syllabus in time.To help those without any means of learning virtually, Susan printed notes and modules that was distributed to her students.“Tender loving care is what drives me and all other teachers to do this for our students, ” she added.Educationist Datuk N. Siva Subramaniam said these teachers deserved to be honoured for the great lengths they went through.“While we recognise the sacrifices and contribution of these teachers, we must never forget that they too have families to take care of, ” added the former NUTP secretary-general, Cuepacs president and human rights commissioner.He said the nation owes its development to the dedication of these teachers who would be based in schools miles away from their families.Some, he added, would even be placed in schools without basic amenities.Based on data from the Education Ministry, there are 671 schools located in rural areas in Malaysia. The majority being in Sabah (285) and Sarawak (330).This is out of more than 10,000 schools in the country.Unsurprisingly there are no rural schools in the federal territories - Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan.Though nothing much can be done about the locality of these schools, there is concern that the students here are once again going to be badly affected when home-based teaching and learning (PdPR) makes a comeback after the Hari Raya holidays.“I think that urban schools would be fine conducting PdPR but the rural schools will have problems, ” said Subramaniam.However, he pointed out that all teachers faced problems implementing PdPR as they were not trained to teach in that manner.He added that the government should quickly provide proper laptops and a mobile data plan to these teachers to enable them to conduct, not just PdPR, but also prepare modules to be sent to their students again.Universiti Utara Malaysia School of Education senior lecturer Dr Muhammad Noor Abdul Aziz said teachers are struggling to make learning happen for their charges.""Given that Malaysian learners are divided into two categories - urban and rural – issues like Internet connection, possession of gadgets, and continuous learning support seem to be a major hindrance among learners in rural areas while their counterparts in the urban area are burdened with homework.""Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten."
"Sunday, 09 May 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,SANDHYA MENON,INTERACTIVE: More policies needed to overcome unemployment among young M'sian women,"PETALING JAYA: The employment disparity between young men and women in the country is alarming.More young Malaysian women are eager to join the workforce, have clearer career goals, and are more academically qualified, but they face higher unemployment rates.This worrying trend was identified in a study by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute titled “Unemployment among Malaysia’s Youth: Structural Trends and Current Challenges”, authored by its senior fellow and Malaysia Studies Programme co-coordinator Lee Hwok Aun.The paper, which was published on June 18,2020, addresses several factors affecting youth unemployment, and substantial gender disparity was one of them.While diverse reasons affect employment opportunities among young Malaysian women, various bodies and non-governmental organisations say marriage-related reasons and cultural aspects play a vital role.Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) executive director Shamsuddin Bardan said some women stop working after marriage.They cite reasons that include family responsibilities, such as having to look after their children and aged parents, he added.“Even after their children no longer require their mother to look after them or their parents have passed on, some women still choose not to rejoin the job market.“This is unlike Japan and South Korea, where women who stopped working due to similar reasons rejoin the workforce once their family-related responsibilities are reduced.“Despite the government’s incentive of tax exemptions for women returning to work after a career break, the take-up rate is low, ” he said.Creating a gender-diverse and inclusive workplace, Shamsuddin added, is a leadership matter.It must be a key component in employers’ policies and mission statements, as well as being demonstrated through actions.Gender biases must be managed through open dialogues and workplace campaigns as well, he said.“Women undoubtedly face more biases from both men and women themselves, explicitly and implicitly.“Unconscious bias is a result of ingrained cultural conditioning where women are not considered as valuable to the workforce, and they are seen as not very committed to the job or the organisation because of family responsibilities and conflicts.“Women might not be as forthcoming in expressing their discontent and their expectations from the employers as they are socially conditioned to undervalue themselves, ” he added.Moving forward, Shamsuddin said the female participation rate in the workforce could be pushed to higher rates, reaching beyond 60% of the LFP (labour force participation).Flexible working hours and work arrangements, work-life balance policies, and remote working are among the policies that could be implemented to encourage more women to work.“The private sector must embrace family-friendly policies and gender diversity in their workforce to boost women’s participation rate.“Employers who actively encourage, nurture and foster women in leadership roles also encourage more women into their workforce, ” he said.All Women's Action Society (Awam) information and communications officer Tan Chia Ee said the trend showing greater progress in closing the gender gap in educational attainment but less in economic participation is a global phenomenon.Occupational segregation could also explain the gender gap in economic participation, she added.“Women tend to concentrate in sectors such as retail, hospitality and care work while being underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), both in universities and in the job market.“This is due to not only longstanding stereotypes surrounding women’s suitability in STEM careers but also having few role models and access to academic support that can boost their interest, motivation and confidence in entering STEM.“Labour market disruption due to Covid-19 exacerbates the gender gap in employment, as women are retrenched due to the destruction of sectors where they predominate, while female talent influx and/or rate of transitioning into STEM remains low, ” she said, adding that women still encounter substantial structural barriers to more productive employment.Women still face strong conventional societal expectations to be homemakers and caregivers, while men are still expected to be family breadwinners.This social norm, she said, can shape biases surrounding women’s suitability for work.In a survey conducted on Malaysian women, Tan said 47% of the 1,010 respondents were asked about their marital status during a job interview, 22% were asked about their ability to perform certain tasks as a woman, 15% were asked about their plans to have children, and 13% were asked if they would require a long maternity leave if they got pregnant.Such questions constitute gender-based discrimination and can directly affect employment outcomes, she stressed.To enable gender parity in employment, she said changes in pre-existing unequal gender power are necessary and the public must play its part.This could be achieved through a multi-pronged strategy involving education, awareness-raising and incentives.Solutions, too, must be viewed from a public policy angle and public awareness on gender equality needs to be increased.“The media also has a role to play in challenging social norms that perpetuate gender inequality.“By promoting sexist perceptions and interpretations, the media can reinforce existing patriarchal power relations, not only making it more difficult to challenge the gender inequality status quo, but also making physical and online spaces less safe for women.“By challenging patriarchal and actively shaping gender-equal public narratives in everyday media, substantial differences can be made in terms of creating a culture that supports gender equality, ” added Tan.Universiti Sains Malaysia Centre for Research on Women and Gender director Prof Dr Noraida Endut has 25 years of experience researching gender issues.The trend according to the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute study, she said, is not necessarily more alarming than before, but she described it as frustrating.“There is a lack of progress and even with progress, it is incremental and takes so much time.“In Malaysia, the LFP rate for women has always been low compared to men.“Only in the last five years or so has the overall LFP surpassed 50%, ” she explained.A study commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme in 2013, she said, showed that the four main reasons women don’t work or stop working include looking after their children, leaving after getting married, leaving upon their husband’s request, and supporting their husband's career growth.“Among the women who have worked before and are now unemployed, about 57% said they want to work but had to stop for various reasons and among the women who have never worked before, 43% said they would like to work.“Therefore, we can see that women end up not working because they had to give up their careers or had to give up seeking employment to fulfil their expected roles as mothers and wives... it's because they are women, ” she said.Prof Noraida stressed that there must be clear policies at workplaces to facilitate a balance between work and family.This would allow for improved gender division of labour at home and at work, allowing more women to return to their workplaces.“These policies include maternity protection that extends to both pre- and post-natal periods where women are given temporary reliefs from some work during their pregnancy, ” she said.In addition, there should also be measures that could include special parking for pregnant women, flexible work arrangements, and an ability to take time off to go for check-ups without sacrificing annual leave.Other moves could include providing safe and accessible lactation rooms, time off to use lactation rooms, and time off to look after sick children for both female and male employees.“A gender equality policy is also important to ensure the organisation observes and develops a gender-equal and non-discriminatory practice.“This includes, for example, prohibiting the practice of asking female candidates about her ability to execute her duties if she is a mother or about her potentially getting pregnant, ” added Prof Noraida.A sexual harassment policy and mechanism is also important because sexual harassment, she said, is a form of gender-based violence that hinders women’s access and opportunity to enjoy their rights at work.“It often causes women to be unfairly treated in their promotion or to be constructively dismissed.”Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities Centre for Research in Media and Communication Assoc Prof Dr Jamaluddin Aziz said the way forward is to depoliticise employment.He said the government, too, should step in to continue providing support systems that would facilitate women empowerment.Women empowerment projects, he said, must be carried out by the right groups and their efficiency must be tested and proven.“There are many factors that contribute to this trend.“Usually, these factors are when economic opportunities, level of literacy and cultural practices intersect with gender.“Therefore, gender is a valid lens from which this trend can be interpreted.“For instance, although a reasonable number of economic opportunities for women have been provided by the government, cultural practices, political interference, and level of literacy may hinder their participation, ” he explained.He said in some instances, although financial aid is given specifically to women to help with their businesses, some register for the benefit of their husbands.There are also those who register their businesses under their husbands’ names.“These are examples of issues at the operational level, while it is the fundamental levels that need more attention – such as the gender structure in our culture as it is often manifested in the way we assign value to men and women, and boys and girls.”Malaysia must move from this mentality and approach, he stressed.Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten."
"Thursday, 06 May 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,DIYANA PFORDTEN,"INTERACTIVE: Vaccine passports – the what, how, why and why not","PETALING JAYA: Countries around the world are exploring ways to show proof of an individual's Covid-19 immunity in order to allow travel and other easing of social restrictions.Several countries have initiated travel passports, which are Covid-19 vaccine certificates or any physical or digital document that would prove you've received both doses (or one dose for certain vaccines) of any of the available Covid-19 vaccines.In some countries, vaccine certificates can also be issued to those who have recently tested negative for Covid-19 or have built immunity against it after having been infected.All this would allow citizens to travel among participating countries or be granted exemptions to certain Covid-19 restrictions in their own country.A recent survey by market research firm Ipsos shows that more than three-quarters of adults surveyed (78%) across 28 countries agree that Covid-19 vaccine passports should be required of travellers entering their country.In comparison to the size of the majority in other countries polled, Malaysians were largely more supportive of having vaccine passports or similar health certificates in order to allow travellers to enter the country (92%).The survey was conducted from March 26 to April 9 with adults from the age of 16 to 75 in 28 countries.The findings show that Malaysians were also highly optimistic that vaccine passports will be widely used by the end of the year.""They strongly believe that this will make travel and large events safe.""Japan, host country of 2021 Olympics, and the United States, which has rolled out a vaccination programme efficiently, are not as optimistic as Malaysia,"" Ipsos said in a statement.Its managing director Arun Menon noted that countries across the world are progressing through their vaccination phases, but some are still facing larger surges or second or third waves of the pandemic.""The Malaysian public widely supports the requirement of vaccine certificates to enter the country and access large venues.""As we cross a year of living with Covid-19, the Malaysian public is looking for ways in which they can get back to normal, even if that requires carrying or mandating vaccine passports or similar health certificates,"" he said.Travel industry players are also hopeful that travel passports will help revive their battered industry.Travel passports or proof of vaccination can be in the form of a physical card, a piece of paper with a QR code, or most often, a mobile app.However, there is still no clear universal standard for vaccine certificates for all countries.The World Health Organisation has also outlined considerations regarding immunity passports due to the shortage of or unequal access to vaccines in many countries.Health experts in Malaysia advise caution on introducing travel passports too soon amid concerns of new Covid-19 variants emerging, vaccine effectiveness and the feasibility as well as fairness of establishing such a system.Despite that, many countries have already started initiating travel bubbles and vaccine passports among other selected countries.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised against travelling to certain parts of the world, and the US State Department's travel advisory outlines the level of Covid-19 risks in countries based on the spread of the Covid-19 virus and number of cases.Only 30 destinations in the world are classified under Level 1 in the travel advisory, which indicates a low risk of Covid-19. These include countries like Brunei, China, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand and Laos.CDC guidelines also noted that once fully vaccinated – defined as two weeks after taking the final dose – it is safe to meet indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks or keeping a distance.Some countries have also used vaccine certificates to return to some measure of normalcy with regard to social activities, such as allowing those with Covid-19 immunity to access mass gatherings, indoor venues and events -- such as stadiums, swimming pools, restaurants, gyms, theatres, concerts, hotels and also pilgrimage sites.However, the CDC guidelines advised those going to medium and large gatherings to take precautions by practising physical distancing and wearing a mask regardless of attendees' vaccination status.The Malaysian government suggested in early April that individuals who have completed two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine may be allowed to travel interstate or even abroad, as well as be exempted from certain Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SOPs).To date, no official decision has been made.The country is still in negotiations with international parties including Asean countries and the European Union on the need for a mutually recognised vaccine passport to resume travel among the partner states."

He drove to a spot across the Prime Minister’s office complex and rolled down the window.He chose a wide angle 17-35mm lens as he didn’t know where exactly the lightning would strike.A lightning streak occurs in a fraction of a second, so he adjusted his Canon Mark 111 camera shutter speed to a high setting of 1/1250 sec and waited.And then it happened.There was a flash of light. He pressed the shutter button, capturing a machine gun rapid eight frames per second.Of the dozen frames he took; the lightning was present in four.He felt disappointed but decided to pack up and leave, rather than stay longer and raise the risk of getting struck.Checking his images after he got home, he realised he had done it.One of the four shots showed a perfect lightning strike on the dome of the Perdana Putra building.Photographer Raja Faisal explaining step by step how he captured the lightning videoPlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time04:34Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenThe photo made the front page of The Star on April 30 that year.The image won him first prize at the 2006 Malaysian Press Institute Award in the Media Photo News, beating over 61 other entries.It also won earned him the Silver Award in the Spot News category of the Asia Media Awards 2006 organised by Ifra, the world’s leading association for newspaper and media publishing.The awards were open to media organisations throughout Asia, with Raja Faisal the first winner from Malaysia.Raja Faisal winning the Silver Award during the Asia Media Awards 2006While photographing a fleeting flash of lightning is challenging, lightning itself is no stranger to many parts of Malaysia.The Klang Valley reportedly has the third highest number of lightning strikes in the world.Last year, the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang had a whopping 341 days with lightning.It was the highest for 2020 based on records of the Malaysian Meteorological Department’s 42 main meteorological stations.Subang meanwhile holds the record for the area with the highest ever number of days with lightning ever recorded.According to MetMalaysia’s figures, there were 362 days with lightning in Subang in 1987.Put another way, there were only three days in 1987 when the highly urbanised city in Selangor’s Petaling district did not see lightning.PlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time01:16Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenAccording to MetMalaysia, the highest amount of lightning is seen during the country’s inter-monsoon periods between April to May and October.Lightning is also frequent between June and September during the south-west monsoon.The north-east monsoon from December to March however sees relatively fewer incidences of lightning.Story: Razak AhmadPhotograph: Raja Faisal HishanAnimation: Nor Shalina Abdul Samad and Shaiful Rizwan Mohd AzharVisualisation: Sim Leoi LeoiTOPBuilt with Shorthand"

""There are clear echoes of Syria in 2011,"" United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has warned on April 14.On Sept 26 last year, as Malaysia grapples with the economic spillover from the Covid-19 pandemic, Muhyiddin has told the United Nations that as a developing nation coping with the cost of managing and providing protection to nearly 180,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers in the country - 86% of them from Myanmar - its resources are being stretched thin.Read more: Find moral courage, political will to do what's right, Muhyiddin tells UNPrime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. - BernamaMalaysia and Asean members will surely not want the present conflict in Myanmar to worsen and result in an even worse flood of refugees.Thailand, Myanmar's neighbour on the south, is already having to face some 2,000 refugees from the ethnic Karen minority massing along its border following air strikes by the junta.Myanmar, the largest country on mainland south-east asia with a population of 54 million people comprising 135 recognised ethnic groups, has long been engrossed in ethnic strife and is engaged in ongoing civil wars with various armed factions within the country, such as the Shan state army near the Thai border.Read more: Worried about Myanmar’s futureA Myanmar national in Malaysia, Than Phe Lay, says they will make their feelings heard via online protests.It was only recently - before the Feb 1 coup - that the country has seen relative peace under some semblance of democratic rule and trade with its neighbours flourish.But the killing of protesters in street demonstrations by the military junta has led to some ethnic armed factions vowing not to stand by and do nothing should this continue.Malaysia, said Hishammuddin, remains firm in its stance that the violence in Myanmar must end and that political detainees must be released immediately.  “We will reiterate Malaysia’s stance on the Myanmar situation in which the violence in the country must cease immediately.“Secondly, all political leaders in Myanmar must be released immediately.Read more: Malaysia calls for Suu Kyi’s releaseForeign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein. - MOHD SAHAR“Thirdly, Myanmar must agree to receive representatives from the Asean chair, which is Brunei, or from the Asean secretariat to help the country return to normalcy,” he stressed.From the three-finger salute, an inspiration from the dystopian novel Hunger Games, to painted Easter eggs, graffiti, and popular memes, the people in Myanmar are taking their fight for democracy to the Internet.The Internet has become as important - and certainly less risky- a frontline as the streets for protesters in the country.Brought on up a diet of social media feed, this Internet-savvy generation of protesters are making sure that when they do turn up for their rallies, they are colourful, unusual and Instagram-worthy to catch the world's spotlight and make sure that their fight is not forgotten.And despite the shutdown of Internet access by the military, they are making sure to flood social media with memes, ranging from Pepe the Frog to NFSW mottoess, mostly in English.This photo taken and received courtesy of an anonymous source on April 8, 2021, shows shoes being displayed with flowers in Mandalay, as part of the ""Marching Shoes Strike"" called on social media.

"Friday, 16 Apr 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,RAZAK AHMAD，DIYANA PFORDTEN,INTERACTIVE: Is postponing interstate travel for Hari Raya Aidilfitri a good idea?,"PETALING JAYA: Ahead of Hari Raya Aidilfitri next month, many Malaysians are wondering whether they would be allowed to travel across state lines to celebrate the festival in their hometowns amid the Covid-19 pandemic.On Thursday (April 15), Health Minister Datuk Dr Adham Baba said that his ministry had proposed a postponement in allowing interstate travel for Aidilfitri celebrations as the Covid-19 transmission rate is still at a worrying level.The ministry had earlier said that it would do a risk assessment study to determine if it is safe to allow interstate travel for Aidilfitri, or whether doing so would lead to another surge of Covid-19 infections.For context, on March 5 the government allowed travel across districts while interstate movement remained restricted.The Star analysed the Health Ministry’s Covid-19 figures from March 1 to April 14 to get a clearer picture on whether things have been improving.What does the data show?One of the things health authorities and experts measure when trying to find out where things are headed is the infection’s reproduction number, called R0 (pronounced as “R naught”).The R value refers to the number of people that a person who has the coronavirus will infect.If the R value is 1 for example, it means that on average, one infected person will spread Covid-19 to one other individual.An R value higher than 1 means that the number of cases will increase.However, if the R value goes down, the disease will eventually stop spreading as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.To calculate the reproduction number, experts use data such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time to estimate how easily the virus is spreading.Since March 1, the daily R value for Malaysia as released by the Health Ministry has climbed to more than 1:Community clusters on the riseOf late there has been an apparent increase in the number of infections due in part to a failure to follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) during social activities and gatherings.In Terengganu, for example, mengeteh or ngeteh – having coffee or tea with friends in restaurants or stalls after subuh (dawn) prayers in mosques or surau – was one factor behind the emergence of a Covid-19 cluster in Besut.Last month, Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah reminded Sarawakians to avoid social gatherings and comply with the Covid-19 SOP.He said the number of cases was high of late because of the failure of some people to adhere to the SOP, particularly at social gatherings.""Several clusters have emerged from social gatherings, where those affected were involved in funerals, weddings, gambling or cock-fighting activities.""These social activities sometimes involve inter-district travel and movement from red zones to other zones, causing the disease to spread,"" he said at the state disaster management committee's briefing in Kuching on March 1.Often, such cases will involve what the Health Ministry classifies as community clusters.According to the ministry’s background description of the clusters, some were linked to funerals, celebrations, social gatherings and weddings.The remaining community clusters were related to index cases detected during hospital admission and procedure screening, pre-employment screening, pre-interstate travel screening as well as screenings of symptomatic individuals.The ministry's figures show that of the 347 new Covid-19 clusters that emerged from March 1 to April 14, 83 (23.9%) were classified as community clusters, making them the second biggest type of cluster behind workplace clusters, which recorded a figure of 236 (68%).A likely reason why workplace clusters dominate is the government’s decision to make it mandatory for all foreign workers to undergo screening.However, authorities experts have repeatedly warned about the threat that is also posed by infections within the community.In deciding whether it will be okay for Malaysians to travel to their hometowns for Hari Raya Aidilfitri, the Health Ministry has said that its risk assessment would be based on six factors:What the experts sayUniversiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman said interstate travel for the purpose of balik kampung should not be allowed until most of the vulnerable groups of the population have received their vaccinations.""We have observed, based on recent data from the Health Ministry, that 69% of deaths related to Covid-19 involve those who are 60 years old and above, and 89% of them have underlying health conditions.""If active and new cases are within one to two digits, and most of our vulnerable group (the elderly and those with comorbidities) have received their vaccines, only then should interstate travel for the country be allowed,"" she said.She urged the public to continue to take precautions, adding that decisions should be made to avoid the possibility of a fourth wave of infections.""The government should continue current strategies on managing the outbreak, enforcement of regulations under Act 342, and promoting the vaccines.""At the same time, all of us in the community should follow all those procedures, comply with the SOP and sign up for the vaccine,"" said Dr Malina.Universiti Putra Malaysia's consultant clinical microbiologist Prof Dr Zamberi Sekawi said that until the number of cases is reduced significantly and herd immunity is achieved, where at least 80% of the population is vaccinated, it is not yet safe for the public to travel freely or live a ""normal life"".""With the current figures, chances are we won't be able to travel interstate for Hari Raya.""Once you open up the borders, the number of cases will surely go up and spread to states where there are few cases,"" he said.Dr Zamberi said if the number of cases is not kept to a low figure, the country risks facing deadlier mutations of the coronavirus.""Our best option now is to get as many people vaccinated,"" he said.He said the government can encourage more people to get vaccinated by giving special allowance to social activities for those who have received the vaccine, such as being able to gather without wearing masks.Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs senior fellow Dr Carmelo Ferlito, meanwhile, believes that movement controls such as the travel ban should be implemented in a targeted approach instead of having generalised policies.He said policies and solutions should be drafted to keep those at risk safe and protected, such as by restricting those liable to severe Covid-19 infections from traveling and to remain confined, while ensuring they have access to ad hoc support.""We should allow the healthy part of the population to conduct a normal life, eventually get infected and go through the illness, developing immunity,"" he said, adding that for this segment of the population, limitations on the number of people per gathering, scientifically decided on a square metre basis of available space, is sufficient.He added that with such an approach, a lot of money could be saved in economic stimuli and instead be invested in developing an effective long-term treatment, which is beyond the use of Covid-19 vaccines.""We have lost more than one year and resources in not trying to develop a treatment,"" he said.He highlighted that the percentage of total mortality from the total number of Covid-19 cases in the country has been on a constant downward trend since September and is currently at 0.37%, a relatively low figure when compared to other countries.He added that the mortality rate was also low in comparison to other illnesses or fatalities due to road accidents.""At the same time, some scientific articles, like a recent one from Science, pointed out that our main concern cannot be simply to limit transmissions.""In fact, by limiting transmissions we can prolong the duration of the pandemic to 10 years, never allowing it to become endemic,"" he said, arguing that interstate travel ban would already be safe if a targeted strategy was implemented.He said that data on death distribution by age groups and with comorbidities can help the government determine who are most at risk, and thus implement policies to protect them.""It is also good to have access to the distribution of Covid-19 tests such as the ratio between tests and cases in places like workplaces and others,"" he said."
"Saturday, 10 Apr 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,DIYANA PFORDTEN，CLARISSA CHUNG,"INTERACTIVE: In Malaysia, unhealthy lifestyles prove increasingly deadly","PETALING JAYA: Unhealthy lifestyles are killing more and more Malaysians, with deaths linked to ailments such as heart and cererbrovascular diseases nearly doubling from 2000 to 2017.This is among the findings of an analysis done by The Star based on Statistics Department figures on the causes of deaths in the country since the year 2000.Commenting on the findings, health experts said the trend underscores why it is vital for Malaysians to adopt a healthy lifestyle through balanced diets, regular exercises and other good habits as these will help prevent health conditions that are killing a growing number of us each year.According to the department’s figures, heart diseases, pneumonia and cerebrovascular diseases are, in order, the top three causes of deaths in the country.Deaths due to ischaemic heart disease saw a nearly two-fold (197%) increase in Malaysia in 2017 compared to 2000.In comparison, the population of Malaysia over the same period only grew by 36%, from 23.49 million in 2000 to 32.02 million in 2017.Ishchaemic heart disease, which is also a leading cause of death in many other countries, happens when arteries cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart, causing a heart attack.In Malaysia, it mainly affects people aged between 41 and 59 years old, as well as those 60 years old and above, especially in urban areas.About 15% of the 109,164 medically certified deaths in 2019 was caused by ischaemic heart disease, followed by pneumonia (12.2%) and cerebrovascular disease (8%).Ischaemic heart disease was the primary cause of death among males, with men making up 69.4% of those who died from the disease, while pneumonia was the top cause of death for females.The number of deaths from cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs), a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, increased by 112% in 2017 compared to 2000.According to the World Health Organisation, an estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths.""Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke.""Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies,"" it said.Medical Practitioners Coalition Association of Malaysia president Dr Raj Kumar Maharajah said the steady increase in deaths caused by non-communicable diseases is due to unhealthy lifestyles.“Everyone feels that the responsibility for their health rests with their family doctor or the Health Ministry. People must realise that they are responsible for their own health and wellbeing.“Obesity rates, for instance, have skyrocketed and we are now the most obese nation in South-East Asia, ” he said.He also added that people in recent years are choosing to “self-medicate” from information they find on the Internet, especially over the last decade.“Many a time, patients search their symptoms on the Internet and they get their medication directly from the pharmacy or traditional medicine men -- bypassing their general practitioners.“This can cause irreversible damage to their bodies and by the time they go to the doctors and get their problems detected, the damage has already been done, ” he said.Dr Raj Kumar suggested that for patients to lead healthier lifestyles to prevent cerebrovascular diseases or ischaemic heart diseases, they must have a dedicated family doctor to continuously monitor their health.“With the Internet, there is too much information from unreliable sources. Patients must not self-medicate or take supplements without checking with their doctors.“Children in schools should be taught to eat good food, exercise regularly and sleep well. This has to be ingrained in school as it will become a habit to lead healthy lifestyles, ” he said.Malaysian Medical Association president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity caused by poor lifestyle habits can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases as well as pneumonia.Commenting on men being more susceptible to heart diseases compared to women, Dr Subramanian said the higher risk among men can be due to poor lifestyle choices.""Unhealthy eating, smoking and alcoholism is known to be higher among men and this can be contributing factors,"" he said.Dr Subramaniam encouraged lifestyle adjustments to reduce the risk of developing these medical conditions.""It is also important that people go for scheduled medical checkups with their general practitioners to be up to date on their health status,"" he said.Meanwhile, deaths caused by pneumonia recorded the largest increase of 579% or 10,543 more deaths in 2017 compared to 2000 and is the leading cause of death for women.""Pneumonia is a condition where the lungs are infected because its smallest units, the sacs of alveoli, are filled with inflammatory fluid or purulent discharge (pus), which would lead to difficulty in breathing, compromised gas exchange, and reduce oxygen intake by the individual,"" said Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman.Dr Malina said that the disease is mainly caused by micro-organisms like viruses, bacteria, fungi, and it is associated with underlying individual health status such as immune status, any chronic illness or pre-existing lung disorder, and socio-environmental factors such as pollutants, ventilation, crowding, and others.She believes that the large hike in the number of deaths related to pneumonia over the years may be due to improved documentation and classification, as well as medical diagnosis.""There may be some changes in case definition for cause of death for the purpose of reporting.""In early 2000, some of those cases with infection were being classified as septicemia,"" she said.Septicemia is a bloodstream infection that occurs when a bacterial infection, which happens elsewhere in the body, enters the bloodstream.The number of deaths caused by septicemia had indeed decreased in 2015 and did not garner notable increase thereafter.""In general, pneumonia is treatable and preventable. There are some vaccines against certain infections,"" said Dr Malina, adding that those with immunity problems such as the young or elderly with health complications, may face more severe complications if infected with the disease.The World Health Organisation estimates that pneumonia kills an estimated 1.4 million children under the age of five every year.The disease is also the third leading cause of death for children under five.Dr Malina said the government, through the Health Ministry, allocated a specific budget for children's vaccination programmes and revised the type of vaccines and the vaccination schedule for children in 2020.""At the current stage, those vaccines are available in all health clinics in our country,"" she said.Starting Dec 1,2020, the country kicked off the national pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) programme that allows children born from Jan 1,2020, onwards to be entitled to free pneumococcal vaccine jabs at the Health Ministry’s health clinics.The vaccine is aimed at preventing bacterial infections of streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus, which can cause diseases such as pneumonia, sinusitis, middle ear infection (otitis media), meningitis and septicemia.""Every parent should get their children vaccinated to prevent severe cases of pneumonia that can cause death,"" she said."
"Saturday, 03 Apr 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,AIDA AHMAD,INTERACTIVE: Young entrepreneurs thriving on aquaponic farming,"THE Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to seriously look at the way we live our lives and more importantly at how we consume food.As many people lost their jobs due to the pandemic, there are those who resorted to growing their own organic vegetables at home naturally, with some hard work.This is to offset paying a huge price for imported organic vegetables.“When we look at the organic agriculture industry in Malaysia, we find that we import a huge percentage of organic food, which doesn’t make sense because we are a farming country at the heart of it, ” said Petaling Jaya-based The Urban Farm director Brendan Lee.He said there was not much education in Malaysia when it came to organic and non-organic vegetables.“All this importing causes such a huge price discrepancy too. Organic vegetables can cost double or triple the price of non-organic vegetables, ” he explained.Brendan opined that we often do not think about the source of the vegetables, where it comes from and how it is grown.“Imported organic vegetables are expensive so people don’t see the need for it. And even if they do, many cannot afford to buy it.“It’s a shame, because when you look at other more developed countries, the difference between non-organic and organic vegetables is at 30%, which is very affordable.“That’s like US$3 (RM12.44) for non-organic and US$3.90 (RM16.17) for a head of organic lettuce in the US, while in Malaysia, it is RM3 for non-organic and RM7.50 for organic.”Brendan’s aquaponic farm was set up more than two years ago, and even then they were not the first.Aquaponic is a pesticide-free way of farming that combines aquaculture --- in this case growing fish --- and hydroponics which is growing plants without soil.The fish do most of the work, by eating and producing waste.The beneficial bacteria in the water converts the waste into nutrient-rich water and is fed to the soil-less plants.Brendan said there were more small and medium-size players coming into the farm-in-the-city game.“This is great, and it is not uncommon to source vegetables from other farms, so you will find that in this industry there is a lot of cross-buying and selling, ” added Brendan.Recently, Brendan started his second farm in Petaling Jaya Old Town, where he had built a fully indoor vertical farm.""We are still utilising aquaponics as the method to grow our vegetables, but we have additional control over the environment with regards to temperature and daylight (through the use of LED grow lights), ” he said.This controlled environment allows him to grow many varieties of vegetables which are unable to tolerate the high temperature outdoors.Brendan, 27, grows many different varieties of kale (Curly kale and Siberian kale), lettuce (Lollo Bionda, butterhead, romaine), herbs (rocket, mint, sweet basil) and local favourites such as dwarf bok choy.According to him, vegetable prices customarily fluctuate depending on the weather.""Excessive rain and flooding will cause prices of the produce to go up. Growing them indoors solves this issue,"" he said.He added that vertical farming also reduced the need to clear land for agricultural use.“By employing new technologies and systems, unused or abandoned urban areas can be revitalised and utilised for food production, ” he said.Over in Cheras, e-business student Sean Lee, 19, needed a hobby last year when the movement control order was first implemented.He had a lot of time on his hands when he was not attending his online university classes.More importantly, he was determined to find a solution to heal his father’s psoriasis.“My father can only eat organic vegetables.“The main problem is the fertiliser and pesticides used in (conventional) farming, and his immune system is working against him.“So, I decided to grow my own vegetables for him, ” said the teenager with a keen interest in aquaponic farming and who is the bubbly proprietor of E-Farm.Sean always had a love for rearing fish in aquariums, but did not like maintaining and cleaning the filtration system, which is why aquaponics worked for him.He started his aquaponic project with one fish tank, a makeshift filter and two vertical plant towers that had spinach, curly kale and bok choy.“Kale is rich in antioxidants, so I gave this to my father and his psoriasis healed a little, ” he said.He set out to start aquaponic farming on a corner lot house with a big garden that could fit a 92.9sq m greenhouse to grow 25 types of vegetables and herbs.It took two months and the help of many property agents to locate the ideal site to start his aquaponic farm, after scouting in Petaling Jaya, Subang Jaya and parts of Kuala Lumpur.As you step into the split-level greenhouse, the first thing you will notice is the pond full of healthy red tilapia.An automated feeder is stocked with fish pellets, and the fish are fed every three hours between 10am and 7pm.Sean said their fish pellets were custom-made to not contain any antibiotics or growth hormones.""The fish are also fed vegetable scraps from unsold vegetables at the farm.""Red tilapia are a common breed of fish used in aquaponic farming.“Patin and koi fish can also be used for aquaponic farming, ” he said.The oyster shells in the fish tank contain calcium and act as a buffer to maintain the optimum Ph level of 6.2 to 7 in the water.The aquaponic process starts with vegetable pellets that are fed to the fish and their waste produces ammonia. The waste is then pumped into the filtration system to remove the solids.The ammonia-filled water is pumped into the biotank, which is an “apartment for bacteria”, with a big surface area.“The bacteria will consume the ammonia (NH₃), and will change it into nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-). Nitrates are what plants need.“The ammonia and nitrite need to be at ‘0’ optimally, as both are poisonous to the fish.“The function of the biotank is to negate the ammonia and nitrite, ” Sean explained.The nitrate-rich water is pumped into the power system, where the plants absorb all the nutrients from the grow beds and multiple aisles of vertical trickle towers.The water from the tower will slowly make its way down into the pond system and from there it feeds the fish again.Sean grows vegetables such as bok choy (which have standard white or emerald green stems and come in a variety of species like Milky, King, Green Dynasty and Four Seasons); choy sum (Shangrila, King and Japan varieties), kale, watercrest, Oba or shiso leaf (Japanese mint), lettuce (green coral and butterhead), Okinawa spinach, Brazilian spinach and herbs such stevia, peppermint, spearmint, rosemary, mizuna and ensabi.He has 120 vertical towers with each holding 90 plants, totalling 10,800 plants overall.The eight grow beds underneath the towers are a space saver, he said.“Every inch is crucial for optimisation, ” he added.The grow bed uses clay balls, called hydroton or light expanded clay aggregate (LECA) which is a substitute for soil.Sean said the system only runs on one water pump which means their electricity bill was kept at a reasonable amount, averaging about RM500 a month while their water bill was RM15 monthly.“Suffice to say, this is a low cost way of growing vegetables, ” he said.Animation by Nor Shalina Abdul Samad and Shaiful Rizwan.Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten."

"Monday, 31 May 2021",8:26 AM MYT,StarPicks,,FinTech – the ‘new normal’ in finance,"THE Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) is changing how we live, work and communicate.With this development that focuses heavily on interconnectivity, automation and real-time data, intelligent technologies are rapidly transforming almost every facet of our life.Cash is no longer king, as banknotes are now being replaced by digital currencies, while e-wallets and digital payments are the new forms of payment.These transformations are spurred by the application of financial technology (FinTech) which embodies IR4.0 technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics.FinTech has risen to challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic by delivering digital, secure, seamless user experiences.Research conducted by the University of Oxford found that accountants have a 95% chance of being impacted by AI technologies.This phenomenon also signifies that accounting and finance professionals have to embrace rapid transformation and adapt to technological advancements.There is a need to be equipped with the strategic knowledge and technical skills for them to stay through new job roles such as FinTech specialists and business data analysts within the industry.In the National Policy on Industry 4.0, FinTech is listed as one of the areas that require talents, and this need has been further fuelled by the Government’s plan to transform the country’s digital economy.Apart from the Government encouraging the masses to use e-wallets through the e-Tunai Rakyat under Budget 2020, Bank Negara announced in 2018 its plans to issue up to five licences for the operations of digital banking within the country to encourage industry players of the financial sector to put innovative technologies into use.Hence, the need for talents in FinTech who possess the essential financial fundamental knowledge as well as the ability to apply technological know-hows in traditional financial services has become even more critical.The APU advantage – infusing IR4.0 into ProgrammesAs one of Malaysia’s highest rated Premier Digital Tech Universities that established its own IR4.0 strategy, Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation (APU) has formed an ecosystem that facilitates the delivery of IR4.0-relevant programmes infusing the following technologies:As part of this ecosystem, FinTech education is integrated into the accounting, banking and finance disciplines, powered by concepts and applications of blockchain technology, Robo advisory, FinTech governance and risk management, digital currencies and cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding.All students under APU’s accounting, banking and finance programmes are exposed to the essentials of FinTech through specially-designed FinTech modules, to ensure that they are not alienated by the rapid transformation happening around the financial sector when they graduate.Pioneering FinTech programmesFor school leavers and future IT professionals, APU offers Malaysia’s first academic programme in FinTech – the Bachelor of Banking of Finance (Hons) with a specialism in Financial Technology, in addition to the BSc (Hons) Information Technology with a specialism in Financial Technology - FinTech.With the recent launch of the Master of Finance with a specialism in FinTech postgraduate programme, career professionals can now stay relevant and keep up with cutting edge disruptive technologies, which are prevalent within the financial sector.APU’s FinTech education was established together with the industry.The first FinTech academic degree in Malaysia offered by APU was built in collaboration with SuperCharger, Asia’s leading FinTech accelerator through an memorandum of agreement inked in 2018. It was aimed to leverage on local opportunities as well as to address the talent needs of Malaysian FinTech and banktech institutions that are facing a talent shortage.Career and Internship Opportunities in FinTechAPU also became the first and only university to sign a pact with the FinTech Association of Malaysia (FAOM) in March 2020.This new partnership opens a whole window of opportunities as APU’s FinTech students are now exposed to career and internship opportunities with over 80 members of FAOM, which include leading banks, financial institutions and FinTech platforms.Industry-focused FinTech activities are set to take place at APU in collaboration with the member companies of FAOM, providing students with relevant industry exposure even before they graduate from university.Industry experts from FAOM will also provide inputs in enhancing the programme to comprise key areas of FinTech, namely digital currencies, blockchain technologies, crowdfunding, Robo-advisory and entrepreneurial finance.According to the latest Annual Graduate Tracer Study by the Higher Education Ministry, 100% of APU graduates were employed upon graduation. This is a significant symbol of APU’s success and pride in nurturing professionals for global careers.APU School of Accounting and FinanceAPU’s School of Accounting and Finance is headed by Prof Dr Nafis Alam – the only one from Malaysia and one of six from the Asia Pacific region – to be featured in the top 100 social media influencers shaping the conversation in the FinTech.Prof Nafis, who has recently published a book on FinTech and Islamic finance, has extensive engagement with the industry and FinTech circle which will further boost the delivery of the programme."

Another five old ferries can be converted into museums, restaurants and special tourist ferries, but not as a mode of public transport,"" he said.He also said despite the country being under a movement control order, the Penang Port Commission (SPPP) has to go through an open tender process even if it involves old or damaged ferries."

It is expected to administer up to 3,000 doses daily.Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin has said that more mega vaccination centres are expected to be set up in the near future, especially in densely populated areas such as Klang Valley, Penang, Johor and Sarawak.The country’s first mega vaccination centre is at the Malaysia International Trade and Exhibition Centre (Mitec), which opened its doors on May 30.With a capacity to vaccinate about 2,000 people a day, the aim is for Mitec to eventually ramp up vaccinations to more than 6,000 people daily.Meanwhile, the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) announced that changes will be made to the date and time of vaccination appointments of those in the Klang Valley as the mega vaccination centres open.It said the changes were made to prevent congestion and enable physical distancing at the centres.“It is also to ensure the comfort and safety of people there, especially senior citizens and persons with disability who will be vaccinated under Phase 2 of the National Immunisation Programme, ” CITF said in a statement yesterday.MySejahtera users can now cancel or reschedule vaccine appointments via the app’s new helpdesk feature.On the MySejahtera home page, users need to click on the “Helpdesk” feature and then the “Vaccination Appointment” option.When “Vaccination Appointment” is opened, three options will appear, the first being for those who have not received a date despite getting a “Thank you” message after booking their slot for the AstraZeneca vaccine.The second option is for those who want to know how to cancel their AstraZeneca appointment while the third is for date changes for non-AstraZeneca appointments.Although Khairy had previously described the mega vaccination centres as the “workhorse” of the NIP, he also stressed that they were only one part of the strategy to distribute and administer the vaccines quickly.General practitioners (GPs) are also being marshalled as an essential part of the vaccination exercise, with the authorities targeting 1,000 GP clinics to be made vaccination centres by the end of June."

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,SARAH SABARATNAM,All in the family,"HE was a top student.Upon completing secondary school, he was received by an institute of higher learning to embark on foundation in law. His parents, a fisherman and a food stall vendor from a small coastal village in Malaysia, were proud of and had high hopes for their bright son. With the good grades he consistently churned out, his future seemed sealed.Then things took an about turn. Ashraf (not his real name), then 18, was arrested. His parents were shocked. Even the judge he stood before in court couldn’t believe how a student who had always excelled in school was now being accused of rape.Ashraf regrets that dark point in his life. Through the influence of wrong company, he had met and become intimately involved with a girl. When their relationship turned sour, her family made a police report against him.In 2013, Ashraf was sentenced to three years in jail and three strokes of the rotan (cane).Today, 26-year-old Ashraf is a successful financial advisor with a degree in international financial economics and a masters in monetary economics under his belt.How was this ex-prisoner able to turn his life around?“When I was in prison, I had a lot of time to think, ” says Ashraf. He understood that he had taken advantage of his parents’ trust in him and let them down.He wanted to do something to make it up to them, and to regain a better future for himself. He made a request to the Prisons Department to sit for the Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia (STPM) exam.His family brought him workbooks in prison to help him revise. He sat for the exam and passed with flying colours. Then he submitted an application to further his studies at a local university.Ashraf will never forget the date he was released from prison, August 8,2015. His family was there to welcome him and he had already received a letter accepting his request to further his studies. He had four days with his family before he needed to leave to enrol in the tertiary institution.“I think in those four days, my parents could see that I had changed and wanted to improve my lot, ” he said. His parents showed him a lot of love and acceptance and even accompanied him to register at the university.The third of five siblings said the support his family gave him while in prison and after he was released made all the difference in spurring him to be a good student again and do well in life.“Family... is the closest thing to us, ” he explained. “If they can accept us, it gives us the confidence and hope that society too will accept us. It gives us hope to live our lives normally after being a prisoner”.His advice to all parents and society is to leave the past in the past and help ex-prisoners focus on the future. After all, he says, the offender has already been judged, and paid the price for his or her offences. Instead, parents and family members should be supportive of ex-offenders in their journey to reintegrate back into society: “Accept them, and give them the opportunity and space to change.”Without the support of family, an ex-prisoner will likely seek out his old friends and his old life, throwing him back into the cycle that landed him in prison in the first place.It is a bleak alternative, and Ashraf pleads with families who have rejected an ex-offender to rethink their approach.“Don’t punish them again for the consequences they have already paid, ” he says, as the ex-offenders will feel hopeless and see no point in turning their lives around. “They will feel, if their own family can’t accept or love them, no one will.”Frederick Foo, director for Service Development in Malaysian Care, concurs that family support is a very crucial and important factor to help ex-prisoners reintegrate into the community. In his experience as a case worker for ex-prisoners, those who are without family support or are rejected by their families will find it very much tougher to reintegrate back into the community.He has witnessed and journeyed with some who have faced real mental torture with far-reaching implications when faced with family rejection.Most ex-offenders, he says, leave prison with a sense of guilt for their past mistakes. They need to settle and address this guilt.In most cases, they are starting from zero. In fact, sometimes the impact of being in prison robs them of their dignity so that they are even starting from below zero. “It will take a lot of determination, motivation and strength to start over, ” he says.Without family acceptance, it will be an additional blow for them as they are denied the opportunity to be forgiven and to make amends.It is also his experience that juveniles below the age of 21 are most likely to be received back by their families, but adults are more likely to face rejection from spouses or their family.Case workers from Malaysian Care make every effort to help ex-offenders touch base with their family. They will usually travel great distances even, to follow an ex-prisoner to visit their family, learn their family background and understand the underlying issues.In the case of Ashraf, Malaysian Care staff learned his parents couldn’t afford the fees for his university education, although he had been accepted. So Care staff pooled together money from volunteers to help fund his first semester fees. Care then connected him to the Discharged Prisoners Aid Society, which provides funding for ex-prisoners. This society covered the rest of his scholarship.Foo remembers Ashraf’s parents as fully backing their son’s endeavour to complete his studies. Despite financial aid, there were times when Ashraf needed additional funds, and his mum would send him the money from her meagre income. She was very proud he had made it to university.“There was no condemnation, or judging, ” says Foo. In fact his mum always shared her hopes for Ashraf to Foo.“Their support freed him to achieve his dream, ” he adds.Through Ashraf’s journey, Foo and his colleagues also discovered inadvertently from their visits to his parents, not only do ex-prisoners struggle with the scars of their past, but family members often feel haunted too.Foo says Ashraf’s mum took a long while but finally opened up about her fear that her son may fall again. She feared relatives or her community might find out. She wondered often if others were talking about what happened. She would worry about how his prison background might affect his future.Foo says his parents were very alone in what they were feeling and had no one they could confide in. They couldn’t share their burdens for fear of being judged or being gossiped about.“That loneliness is a very real struggle, ” he notes.Foo felt this was a necessary component that everyone should be aware of – the pain that families of ex-prisoners go through. Society shouldn’t add to this weight by their condemnation and unwillingness to give ex-offenders a second chance.Ashraf echoes this sentiment: “Support ex-offenders. Give them a chance. Don’t discriminate.”If no one wants to give ex-prisoners the opportunity to find an honest living, he asks, how will they stay honest? They will have no choice but to return to their old way of life, just to go on supporting themselves. They could turn to alcoholism or drug addiction to drown their sorrows.“Please, ” he says, “Make it easier for them to reintegrate and don’t make them feel ashamed of their past.”And where family can’t bring themselves to play that role, Foo’s experience has revealed another possibility: a friend or the community.“As I journey with people from prison, I have observed a common need to have someone to listen to them, to have a friend journey with them and share their burden and empathise with them, ” says Foo.In such situations, when one doesn’t have family support, someone else, in the form of a friend, colleague, neighbour or community can be that encourager in times of need.Freelance writer and former journalist Sarah Sabaratnam is part of the YouTurn Project media team."

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,YUEN MEIKENG,Cut down on grocery runs to stay safe,"Malaysians should try to limit trips to buy groceries to reduce the risk of being exposed to Covid-19. Don’t be too fussy about food choices either during such hard times, experts advise.BUY groceries to last for two weeks, store food in optimum ways and don’t be too fussy about available choices.Such are the words of advice to consumers, so that they can cut down on trips to supermarkets, wet markets and stores to limit exposure to Covid-19 and its variants.It has become crucial to stay home as much as possible, with the rise of sporadic cases and new infections looming in thousands each day in Malaysia.Shopping online is one of the safer ways to get fresh produce and avoid crowds, but due to high traffic, there are times when orders are delayed or items are unavailable.If this is not an option, experts urge people to limit their grocery runs to once in two weeks, instead of weekly.Federation of Malaysian Consumers Associations (Fomca) deputy secretary general Nur Asyikin Aminuddin says it’s possible to buy fresh food that can last up to two weeks.“But we need to keep them under optimum condition.“The freshness of the food will deteriorate with time. But consumers should not be too fussy at such critical times.“More importantly, we still have food on our table, ” she says.With the emergence of new Covid-19 variants, Nur Asyikin calls on consumers to stop crowding in enclosed areas to stock up on groceries.“Retailers should also improve their online services for the benefit of customers, ” she adds.Recently, people were seen flocking to supermarkets immediately after the government announced a total lockdown from June 1 to 14.This is despite the authorities assuring that there is sufficient food supply during the movement control order (MCO) and no shortages in previous lockdowns.On such panic buying, Nur Asyikin urges consumers to change this bad habit, as it can lead to overbuying and food wastage.Concurring that Malaysians shouldn’t be choosy, Nutrition Society of Malaysia president Dr Tee E. Siong says consumers should be prepared to use alternatives.“For example, if we can’t find the type of rice that we are used to, we can also consume sweet potatoes.“We still try to rely on fresh foods as the main source of food supplies, but we cannot run away from using some pre-packaged, canned or frozen foods.“Even in normal times, there is no harm in consuming some of these, which have a longer shelf life, ” Dr Tee says.However, people should choose healthier varieties of such foods by reading the nutrition information.“We may have to rely on frozen food like fish, prawn, peas and corn as these will last longer, ” he says.Storage is keyProper storage also preserves our food longer and can save us a trip to the grocers.For fresh vegetables, Dr Tee says people can opt for non-leafy types like cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, leek and bitter gourd as they don’t wilt quickly.“To keep the veggies longer, especially the leafy kind, you can spread out the veggies to air and remove the moisture so that they last longer.“Pack them into smaller bags, especially for green vegetables like spinach, sweet potato leaf and kangkong.“It is better to remove yellow and rotten parts before keeping in the fridge, ” he advises.Meat like poultry should be put into smaller packs and frozen.“Keeping a big piece is not advisable as we need to thaw it, cut what we need and freeze it back. Such repeated freezing and thawing will affect the quality of the meat, ” he says.Similarly for big portions of fish, consumers should cut smaller pieces and keep them in separate bags.“Nutritionists recommend cooking brown rice as they are healthier, but they spoil faster as they contain healthy fatty acids. So, keep brown rice in cool places, ” Dr Tee adds.Hoping that families will keep preparing healthy meals at home, he says the goal should be to strengthen the immune system to fight Covid-19.“We should think beyond the pandemic, to realise that healthy eating is the key towards fighting the non-communicable diseases that we have been grappling with for decades.“We also need to win the fight against obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer, ” he highlights.Noting that the pandemic isn’t ending anytime soon, Dr Tee says the public should come to terms with the reality that Malaysia is in this for the long haul.Freeze your foodAnother way that consumers can stretch our grocery visits is by fully utilising our freezers, says Khazanah Research Institute senior research associate Dr Sarena Che Omar.“Once frozen, a food item can stay good for many months.“This includes most protein sources such as meat and seafood, and even milk.“Bread can be frozen too, and toasted when needed, ” says Dr Sarena, whose areas of interest are policies on food, agriculture, and sustainability.Some vegetables can also be placed in the freezer like ginger, galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, curry leaves, pandan leaves, petai, broccoli and cauliflower.“For fresh herbs, buy those that come in pots. Some can also be kept longer in water such as spring onions and coriander, ” Dr Sarena adds.She says it’s now a good time for people to start their own food garden, especially in growing ulam and herbs for the kitchen if they have the space to do so.Agricultural and resource economics specialist Prof Datuk Dr Nasir Shamsudin says these times provide an opportunity for Malaysians to practise sustainable consumption that will reduce food wastage.After all, Malaysians produce enough food waste to fill seven Olympic-sized swimming pools daily, according to the Solid Waste Management and Public Cleansing Corporation (SWCorp).In the first MCO, disruptions in the food chain were minimal as food supply was adequate and thus, the market was stable.“In the MCO 3.0, we should not expect any insufficient food supplies.“However, we may risk a looming food crisis unless measures are taken to protect the most vulnerable, keep food supply chains alive and mitigate the pandemic’s impacts across the food system, ” he says.As such, Dr Nasir says the Pemerkasa Plus aid announced by the Prime Minister that RM2.1bil will be distributed to households earning less than RM5,000 per month is timely to avoid any food insecurity for the low income group.“What is important now is to make sure the supply chain involving farmers, processors, and distributors is efficient to avoid hiccups in supply.“The authorities should continue to closely monitor food prices and strengthen market supervision, and ensure effective delivery of agricultural inputs including feed, ” he says.Dr Nasir calls for strategies to ensure better food security preparedness in case there is another pandemic or other major catastrophes.“The government should support the digitization of the food business supply chain from farms to consumers, ” he suggests.For consumers whose livelihoods are cut off due to the MCO, the government needs to ensure the continuity of livelihood assistance especially among the urban poor, Dr Nasir says."

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,DIYANA PFORDTEN,To sanitise or not to sanitise,"PETALING JAYA: The recently launched nationwide sanitation exercise continued to draw intense debate from experts over its effectiveness.In the latest round, a group of top scientists said they were behind University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) Covid-19 task force chair Datuk Prof Dr Adeeba Kamarulzaman who questioned the need to roll out the sanitation programme and saying that the money could be better used elsewhere.Dr Adeeba had raised this following Housing and Local Government Minister Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin’s announcement of a two-day mass sanitation programme, which began on May 29 as part of the effort during lockdown to bring down the surging Covid-19 numbers.The group of scientists shared Dr Adeeba’s arguments that the resources for outdoor disinfection could be better spent elsewhere such as for medical equipment and food for volunteers.However, the political secretary to Zuraida, Nor Hizwan Ahmad, in a statement on Friday said a total of 26,000 sanitation operations had been conducted since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country and would continue as an effort to prevent Covid-19 infection, citing new variants that are present in the community.“The people need assurance and appreciate efforts made by the government to minimise the risk of infection.“Furthermore, it is focused on areas that have been confirmed to have had an active case of Covid-19, ” he said.Nor Hizwan explained that the sanitation process was a public sanitisation procedure, which includes cleaning, decontamination and disinfection.Recently, the Fire and Rescue Department director-general Datuk Mohammad Hamdan Wahid clarified that the department had consulted with the Health Ministry and the Chemistry Department to ensure that the use of chemicals for public sanitation and disinfection in public places was in accordance with stipulated protocol.In a WHO report, it stated that cleaning and disinfecting surfaces could reduce the risk of infection.However, the Academy of Medicine of Malaysia in a statement on Thursday had highlighted the United States’ Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention’s guideline, which stated that “spraying cleaning products or disinfectants in outdoor areas such as on sidewalks, roads or groundcover is not necessary or recommended”.The academy expressed its support for Dr Adeeba and stressed that strategies to fight against Covid-19 should be based on science, stressing that the government must prioritise Covid-19 interventions to help reduce the number of cases, as well as to reduce the burden on healthcare facilities and its workers.It called for a whole-of-government effort to produce ventilation guidelines for all indoor space instead and noted that many commercial and residential buildings in the country would need updating to meet new standards."
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,YUEN MEIKENG,‘Worst case scenario’ thinking causes people to rush to supermarkets,"MALAYSIA has gone through 18 months of the Covid-19 pandemic without any food shortages. So people need not rush to stock up on groceries each time a lockdown or extension of the movement control order is announced.Former Malaysian Psychology Association president Dr Goh Chee Leong says one reason why many still rush to supermarkets is because people in general tend to plan and act based on worst case scenarios.“This may explain why many still flock to the supermarkets in spite of all evidence showing there is ample access to essential items during the lockdown.“It is ‘but what if’ thinking. For example, such thoughts could be along the lines of ‘But what if all the groceries run out next week?’ ‘But what if there’s no more toilet paper supply in the supermarkets?’” he illustrates.When there’s any sense of insecurity or uncertainty, people tend to move into “survival” mode, which is to quickly get what we need to survive first, Dr Goh says.In these situations, he advises the public to remain calm.“We’ve never run out of food or essential supplies at any time during the pandemic. So keep safe and don’t rush, ” he urges.It was reported that despite the government’s assurance that essential items will be available during the two-week MCO from June 1 to 14, Malaysians nationwide were seen stocking up on supplies in droves.Dr Goh says the fear and anxiety now among the general public is greater than last year, because the number of Covid-19 cases and the mortality rate is far higher this year.But fear is not a bad thing, Dr Goh says, as it is part of an evolutionary instinct that keeps us alive.“If more Malaysians had a healthy fear of Covid-19, we probably would not be in our current state of crisis, ” he says.An important part of staying mentally healthy during times of crisis is connecting regularly with our network of social support, whether they be family members or friends or colleagues.“Another key to keeping our sanity during this difficult period is to embrace the fact that we cannot control every-thing. We cannot win every battle and we should not feel that we have to carry the burden for every bad thing that is happening in our families, our organisations and our world, ” he says.Dr Goh assures that it’s human to feel helpless and powerless sometimes, or to feel at the mercy of circumstances.“So it’s all right to give ourselves a moment of vulnerability and rest before we need to gather our strength again to continue the battle, ” he says.Malaysian Mental Health Association president Prof Datuk Dr Andrew Mohanraj says one reason people irrationally stockpile essential items is because humans have a strong propensity to follow the decisions of others.“We follow others because we believe there is a good reason for their actions, ” he says, citing an example of when we choose to eat in a crowded restaurant because we assume that others know that it is a good place to eat in.Similarly, people tend to go into an irrational stockpiling mode because others are doing it, assuming that what they are doing has some basis in rationality.“Government agencies may need to step up their public education measures to mitigate irrational stockpiling. Studying consumer food purchasing behaviours and the resulting market stress is imperative to prepare for potential market disruptions, ” Dr Mohanraj says.On the public’s overall mental health, he says this pandemic is undoubtedly a traumatic event.“The challenges faced by big and small businesses are also real. While businesses are likely to adopt cost cutting measures to remain afloat, I would also urge them to be kinder, compassionate and generous with their staff, ” he says.Dr Mohanraj stresses that mental health needs should be addressed as an integral part of the Covid-19 response, with special attention paid to improving social and psychological support levels to increase public resilience.“Experiencing negative emotions during this difficult time is to be expected.“It is important to acknowledge these experiences and work towards positive coping mechanisms without blaming oneself for the situation, ” he advises.He urges the public to stay in contact with supportive family and friends, invest time in physical health by eating healthy meals, exercising and refraining from abusing alcohol or nicotine.Those needing psychological support may contact the Malaysian Mental Health Association hotline at 03-2780 6803 during office hours."

He also pushed back on assertions that the former administration strained ties with Japan and other allies in the region.“Some of the key pillars of our strategy in the Indo-Pacific region were ideas that we borrowed and adapted and shared and collaborated on with Japan,” Pottinger said in a panel discussion featuring former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and former national security adviser Robert O’Brien, called a “Seminar on Conservative Realism and National Security on US-Japan Relations”.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.“So the whole idea of a quadrilateral format is an idea that [former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe] came up with during his first stint as prime minister” in 2006 and 2007, Pottinger said. “The idea of a free and open Indo-Pacific, that concept that, that catchphrase, we consciously adopted it and adapted it from the minds of our closest allies in Japan.”“There’s a saying in the Japanese military: ‘Taiwan’s defence is Japan’s defence.’ And, and I think that Japan will act accordingly,” Pottinger added.His comments in the discussion organised by the Nixon Foundation in California came amid a series of incursions by Chinese warplanes into Taiwan’s southwest air defence identification zone, and follows the inaugural meeting in March of the heads of state from each of the Quad countries.In that virtual meeting, US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison discussed “aggression” and “coercion” against members of the group by China and issued a statement calling for the region to be “anchored by democratic values”, and for freedom of navigation and overflight as key objectives.Reflecting the overall continuity between administrations on China policy – as well as broad bipartisan consensus in the US about the country – Pompeo and O’Brien offered somewhat supportive comments about the way Biden has taken negotiations with the Quad forward.China plays up trade with Britain but seeks respect for sovereigntyLeaders of the Quad countries “were looking at the United States very clearly and could see that there was a time limit to an administration, and I think they wanted to see that this was going to be an enduring set of policies that wouldn’t change as administrations changed”, Pompeo said.“I hope the next administration – they’ve said good things about this, they’ve applauded regularly, one of the few things they’ve given the Trump administration some credit for – I hope they’ll seriously work to go build this out,” he added.O’Brien, meanwhile, called Biden’s approach to the alliance “positive”.“The initial soundings from ... the Biden administration are very positive when it comes to the Quad and strengthening those relationships,” O’Brien said. “I hope they follow through, and I wish them luck on that front and Godspeed in that endeavour because it’s a very powerful group.”In his defence of the Trump administration’s foreign policy, Pottinger criticised unspecified media for perpetuating a “myth ... that somehow the Trump administration had badly strained our alliances in the Indo-Pacific region”, pointing out that Pompeo led the first cabinet-level Quad meeting in October 2020.“I’ve never seen an empirical fact produced to suggest that our alliances did anything other than strengthen over the course of the Trump administration,” he said.“Vietnamese officials told me regularly that the relationship had never been better. Officials in Taiwan told me the same thing, career officers in Australia, and most of all in Japan.”However, Trump frequently tied Washington’s continued defence arrangements with Japan and South Korea to increased outlays by the two governments for US troops stationed in those countries.In 2019, Trump insisted that South Korea and Japan quadruple their payments for US military deployments in their countries to roughly US$5 billion and US$8 billion, respectively.Fallout from the demands became apparent when a US delegation to Seoul cut short talks over how to share the costs after the South Korean government balked at accepting Trump’s unexpected demands.Kyodo news agency reported at the time that Japanese officials told then-national security adviser John Bolton that the increase was “unrealistic”.More from South China Morning Post:US should help Taiwan prepare for irregular war, hearing told, but experts fear destabilising regionChina-UK relations: Beijing plays up trade but says Britain must respect its sovereigntyUS-China trade dialogue ‘shows continuity’ in Beijing’s approach to relationsUS-China trade war: overdue talks restart on Biden’s watch, but analysts ask if real progress can be madeFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021."

Its vaccine has already been approved for use in mainland China after interim results showed it was 65.7 per cent effective.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Another product developed by Sinopharm and its affiliated institute in Wuhan has had an application registered for an emergency use listing.The vaccine has been tested in a bundled trial with another Sinopharm vaccine that has already been given the green light by the WHO, and the state-owned company published the result of the trials of the two vaccines in an international journal last week.On Monday, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products said it had started work on a new factory that would increase its production capacity of Covid-19 vaccines to at least one billion doses, an important step toward hitting Sinopharm’s target of producing three billion doses of both vaccines this year.China hits out at vaccine ‘hoarding’ nations during BRICS talksThe third Chinese company, a subsidiary of Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products, has also formally registered its interest, but has been asked to supply further information.All three may face a lengthy process before the WHO decides on their use.The WHO is also in discussions with Clover Biopharmaceuticals about how it can apply, while a candidate vaccine by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences is still at the early stages of trials and must wait to enter the formal process.The emergency use approval of two Chinese vaccines – made by Sinopharm and Sinovac – has been hailed by the state news agency Xinhua as giving China a platform to help the global fight against Covid-19 and to narrow the gap in the unequal distribution of vaccines.The article also noted that, unlike some other approved vaccines, the Chinese products do not need to be stored at ultra-low temperatures, which would improve access, and said the approvals would “boost the confidence of developing countries to strengthen their innovative capability”.China’s first Covax vaccines roll off Sinopharm factory linesChina – which has already been selling vaccines to developing countries, especially in Latin America – has also become increasingly vocal about the need to distribute vaccines through the WHO’s Covax Facility, which is intended to ensure equal access to vaccines internationally.“The world desperately needs multiple Covid-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,” Mariângela Simão, the WHO’s assistant-director general for access to health products, said on Monday.“We urge manufacturers to participate in the Covax Facility, share their know-how and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.”Covax will only use vaccines that have been approved for emergency use, and experts said that the WHO was keen to add Chinese vaccines to the list in the wake of the recent pandemic crisis in India.Anthony Zwi, professor of global health and development at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said that Chinese vaccines approved for emergency use could help ease the shortages Covax faces because of the Indian outbreak and vaccine inequity.“A wider range of vaccines, if proven to be effective and safe, from a wider range of manufacturing countries, distributed through Covax, could also play an important part in reducing vaccine nationalism and the negative effects of vaccine diplomacy,” he said.Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor at City University of Hong Kong specialising in health security, said. he thought that “the argument around Sinovac is essentially the same as Sinopharm – namely that the WHO is getting concerned about the Indian outbreak but also about the possibility of variants emerging.“That said, the fact that Sinovac does prevent serious complications, reduced hospitalisations, and prevents deaths, will be a boost for Covax.”China is also racing to meet domestic demand for vaccines and has approved four vaccines for general use, including those by Sinopharm, Sinovac and CanSino. Two vaccines have also been given emergency use authorisation, including candidates by Zhifei and Kangtai Biologicals.However, all the products in question have been developed in China and the authorities have yet to say when they will start the authorisation process for the vaccine developed by BioTech, even though it has an agreement with Fosun Biologicals to sell and manufacture the product in China.Kangtai said in February that it had completed a facility with a capacity to produce 400 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines for China, but there has been no word on whether the authorities will consider their authorisation.Additional reporting by Simone McCarthyMore from South China Morning Post:Coronavirus: China hits out at vaccine ‘hoarding’ nations during BRICS talksSinovac coronavirus vaccines create ‘immunity barrier’ in Brazilian town: studyFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021."

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Carrie Lam meets new head of Beijing’s foreign ministry office in Hong Kong“At the core of the Hong Kong issue is a battle against forces trying to seize power and seek subversion and infiltration,” he said. “Facts have proven that their attempt to curb China’s development by exploiting Hong Kong-related issues is a pure miscalculation.”Liu also accused foreign forces of adopting a “Cold War mentality” in trampling on the norms of international law by meddling with Chinese and Hong Kong affairs.“[They] make use of human rights, democracy and freedoms as pretexts to interfere with Hong Kong affairs, to maliciously slander the central government’s policies on Hong Kong, endorse anti-China elements, and even go as far as to impose various sanctions,” Liu said at his maiden press gathering.Liu said foreign forces had “knocked at the wrong door and made a wrong decision”, reiterating that no external interference could sway China’s determination to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, or its commitment to fully and faithfully implementing the “one country, two systems” policy.He said his office’s priorities were to oppose foreign meddling, assist Hong Kong’s growth and serve local residents’ interests more effectively.“We will fight back against external interference more robustly ... As long as the foreign forces do not give up meddling with Hong Kong affairs, the foreign commissioner’s office will continue taking up the responsibility of defending our territory, and establishing a strong line of defence and security,” he said.Liu said Beijing’s imposition of a security law on Hong Kong last June and the more recent overhaul of its election system to ensure only patriots governed the city had plugged a serious loophole in safeguarding national security.He added his office would aid the city’s economic development by helping residents grasp the opportunities offered by the country’s 14th five-year plan, the Belt and Road Initiative and the Greater Bay Area plan, which hopes to turn Hong Kong, Macau and nine mainland cities into a global technology and finance hub.He also pledged to enhance Hongkongers’ awareness of the country’s diplomatic efforts.Liu arrived in Hong Kong last week to assume the role of new foreign ministry commissioner in the city, filling a vacancy left by Xie Feng, who returned to Beijing in January after holding the post since 2017. Xie was made vice-minister of foreign affairs.After his meeting with Lam on Tuesday, Liu also met her predecessor, Leung Chun-ying, who is now a vice-chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, China’s top political advisory body.Assigned to the Chinese embassy in Washington from 2007 to 2010, Liu was director general of the ministry’s Department of External Security Affairs from 2014 to 2018.He also spent time as deputy consul general in San Francisco from 2000 to 2002, and was a vocal defender of Beijing policy during his tenure as ambassador to Poland from 2018 to April this year.For the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021."

At least 847 have been killed, a rights group says. The army disputes that figure.Meanwhile, daily protests against the military have evolved in parts of Myanmar into armed insurrections while decade old ethnic conflicts have flared anew.Opponents of the junta have voiced frustration at the lack of tough action by ASEAN and say the meeting of two representatives of the group with junta leader Min Aung Hlaing on Friday gave him greater legitimacy but brought no benefit.Thailand has a longer border with Myanmar than any other country and fears the conflict could bring a flood of refugees.

As a result, jitters emerged regarding demand for Malaysia's semiconductor components from China,” he told Bernama.Adam added that any unchanged tone from Biden regarding the restrictions on China companies would contribute further to the ringgit’s weakness next week.On Friday, the US Labour Department reported higher payrolls by 559,000 in May after a revised 278,000 gain in April, while the jobless rate dropped to 5.8 per cent.On a weekly basis, the ringgit appreciated versus the US dollar to 4.1275/1285 from 4.1320/1350 a week earlier.The local note was higher against other major currencies.It strengthened against the yen to 3.7482/7494 from 3.7598/7629 a week earlier, and increased versus the British pound to 5.8313/8327 from 5.8604/8651 previously.The ringgit rose against the euro to 5.0013/0025 from 5.0344/0385 and strengthened against the Singapore dollar to 3.1076/1086 from 3.1213/1238 in the preceding week. - Bernama"

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",11:18 AM MYT,Asean+,,G7 strikes 'historic' agreement over global corporate tax,"LONDON, June 5 (AFP): Finance ministers from wealthy G7 nations on Saturday night (June 6) endorsed a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15 percent, rallying behind a US-backed plan targeting tech giants and other multinationals accused of not paying enough.US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen hailed the ""unprecedented commitment"", saying in a statement that a global minimum tax ""would end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation"".Facebook even got behind the move despite the social media giant facing the prospect of having to pay more tax -- while non-governmental organizations said it did not go far enough.Following the two-day gathering in London, the G7 said in a final communique that it will ""commit to a global minimum tax of at least 15 percent on a country by country basis"".The G7 -- comprising Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- said it hoped to reach a final tax agreement at the July gathering of the expanded G20 finance ministers group.The G7 also committed to making companies carry out mandatory reporting regarding the climate impact of their investments.It additionally said it will continue to support ""the poorest and most vulnerable countries as they address health and economic challenges associated with Covid-19"".Regarding the commitment on taxation, Britain's Treasury noted that ""the largest and most profitable multinationals will be required to pay tax in the countries where they operate -- and not just where they have their headquarters"".- 'Historic agreement' -Welcoming the move, Facebook's vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg tweeted that the company wanted ""the international tax reform process to succeed and recognise this could mean... paying more tax, and in different places"".British finance minister Rishi Sunak, who chaired the talks held in person after an easing of Covid-19 restrictions, expressed delight at ""a historic agreement to reform the global tax system"".Sunak said the G7 had agreed to make the system ""fit for the global digital age"", as he thanked his counterparts for striking ""a deal of historic significance"".The landmark move comes as governments seek to repair finances battered during the pandemic by slashed tax receipts plus vast spending and borrowing.The London gathering has also prepared the ground for a summit of G7 leaders in Cornwall, southwest England, starting Friday, and which Biden is set to attend.Momentum has grown behind the US-led plans to limit the ability of multinationals such as tech giants to game the tax system to boost profits, especially at a time when economies around the world are reeling from the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz on Saturday said the commitment was ""very good news for justice and fiscal solidarity"".""Enterprises can no longer shy away from their fiscal obligations by cunningly transferring their profits to countries with opaque tax structures,"" he said, calling the move ""bad news for tax havens"".- 'Far too low' -French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire called it a ""historic step"" in the fight against fiscal evasion.""It's a starting point and in the months ahead we will fight for this minimum tax to be the highest possible,"" Le Maire said in a video message on Twitter.Biden had called for a unified minimum corporate tax rate of 15 percent in negotiations with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and G20.OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann called the G7 agreement ""a landmark step toward the global consensus necessary to reform the international tax system"".British charity Oxfam said the agreed minimum rate was not high enough.""It's about time that some of the world's most powerful economies force multinational corporations, including tech and pharma giants, to pay their fair share of tax,"" said Gabriela Bucher, executive director of Oxfam International.""However, fixing a global minimum corporate tax rate of just 15 percent is far too low.

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,FAYE FLAM,Virus labs around the world need more oversight,"EVEN if we never learn whether Covid-19 escaped from a lab or jumped to humans from animals, the public is entitled to a closer look at what’s going on in virology labs.Some scientists worry that laboratory scientists are getting too little oversight on projects that could potentially start pandemics. Others worry about the global proliferation of labs that work with dangerous viruses and other pathogens.The journal Nature accused politicians and the press of stirring up a “divisive” argument over the origins of the pandemic, but it’s only reasonable to want an explanation for some curious facts.The virus that has killed 3.5 million people so far and upended the lives of billions of others seems to have its closest relative in horseshoe bats, yet there are no horseshoe bat colonies close to Wuhan, China, where the pandemic was first identified. Wuhan does, however, host a lab holding the world’s largest collection of bat coronaviruses.A World Health Organisation team sent to investigate came back with little in the way of plausible explanations for SARS-CoV-2. Nor are the explanations mutually exclusive – the virus could be a naturally occurring bat virus collected by a scientist and placed in a lab from which it later escaped.There’s no convincing evidence that this virus has been genetically manipulated, but it’s well known that scientists have manipulated other viruses to make them more dangerous.Just look at the US.Biologist Richard Ebright, a professor at Rutgers University, walked me through a history of biodefense laboratory research going back to 9/11 and the anthrax attacks that followed in its wake.Because Congress was targeted in those attacks, the incident spurred the US government’s interest in researching germ warfare defenses. But things took a strange twist: While it was commonly assumed the attacks were carried out by foreign terrorists, a multi-year investigation pointed back to an American biodefense researcher.Investigators linked the attacks to Bruce Ivins, a virologist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick, Maryland, though he killed himself before he could be tried.Perhaps increasing controls over biodefense research would have been a more rational response than ramping up funding.Ebright told me that back in 2003, the scientific community started to voice concerns over the realisation that emerging genetic technology might, in principle, allow people to alter viruses to make them deadlier or more transmissible. And indeed, such experiments started happening – funded by the National Institutes of Health and done in the name of defense, or simply to better understand viruses as a line of basic research.A project in 2005 led to the re-creation of the deadly 1918 pandemic flu virus – something that helped scientists understand why that pandemic struck so many young, healthy people, but also led to concerns over the risk of a lab leak.Another project in 2011 altered a bird flu virus so it could spread between mammals. This was a particularly scary creation because bird flu can occasionally jump from birds to humans, killing about 60% of those infected. A version of this that could travel from human to human would be devastating. Debate continued for years over whether the benefits of this kind of research could possibly justify the grave risk, though the research was scheduled to resume in 2019.There’s also US funding for virus surveillance, which carries its own risks. Researchers go out and collect viruses, grow them in their labs, and use them in experiments. Ebright considers this analogous to the space virus collection in The Andromeda Strain, except that now we know that plenty of exotic viruses exist right here on Earth.Scientists have, more recently, been creating genetically altered coronaviruses. That research has been done as a collaboration between US labs and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. In one controversial project, researchers took bat coronaviruses and introduced changes to see if they could induce greater pandemic potential. That research was published in 2015 in Nature Medicine.More experiments followed, in which the spike gene of one coronavirus was fused to the backbone of another, creating new viruses increasingly adept at infecting human cells.And so this is, of course, a cookbook for constructing a virus of extremely high pandemic potential, ” says Ebright.Under Obama, there was a “pause” on funding for gain-of-function research in 2014 and calls for a review of existing research, which was carried out through the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). Under Trump, there was a new set of controls, which required reviews through the NIH, but Ebright said only two projects were ever reviewed.In practice, this meant weaker protections were in place.Ebright suggests that OSTP or another independent entity should be responsible for oversight, rather than agencies that do research or fund it.Purdue University virologist David Sanders told me he agrees with Ebright’s concerns, but he thinks the danger lies less in these genetic manipulation experiments and more in the worldwide proliferation of labs that deal in deadly pathogens, natural or engineered.He says there should be oversight, but that some genetic manipulation of viruses can provide valuable insights. Gene therapy, for example, uses altered viruses to deliver lifesaving genetic material into human cells.And he wasn’t convinced by arguments laid out in an influential article by former New York Times science writer Nicholas Wade, first published in Medium, implying SARS-CoV-2 was the product of genetic modification. There’s nothing about the virus that would make a natural origin unlikely.But how did it get into humans? We still don’t know. And it’s perfectly reasonable to keep asking questions. – Bloomberg"

In fact, Time has joined forces with the famous Portuguese bookstore Livraria Lello to exhibit covers featuring some of the greatest authors of the 20th and 21st centuries.The magazine has partnered with Porto's ""cathedral of books"" as the host of its latest covers exhibition, which asks What Makes a Nobel? The exhibition showcases winners of the legendary Nobel Prize in Literature through the covers of Time, as well as the writers who ""could have"" received the world's top literary award.The American publication has featured 14 of the 117 Nobel Prize for Literature winners on its cover since 1923. The most recent was the late American writer Toni Morrison, who became the first African-American woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993.Over the years, several winners have graced the Time cover multiple times. The former British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill leads the way with six covers, followed by the American playwright Eugene O'Neill and William Faulkner.Creating interest in booksAs well as Nobel Prize winners, the Livraria Lello bookstore has also chosen to honour more than 100 writers who ""could have"" received the award, many of whom also featured on Time covers. Such figures include William Shakespeare, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, J.R.R Tolkien and George Orwell.""We want to arouse curiosity for these authors and, consequently, curiosity about books,"" explains Aurora Pedro Pinto of Livraria's executive board.Creating interest in books has been part of the Lello bookstore's mission since it was built in 1906. The establishment houses more than 60,000 books in Portuguese, as well as in Spanish, French and English.Before the pandemic, the store would regularly see book-lovers and students in Porto rub shoulders with hordes of tourists from all over the world.In fact, many visitors are keen to see the first floor of the Lello bookstore, whose astonishing sculpted staircase is said to have inspired the British novelist J.K. Rowling in the first volume of her successful series, Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone.Until the end of the year, literature lovers from Porto and further afield will also be able to catch the exhibition What Makes a Nobel? - AFP"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",8:49 AM MYT,Business,,China’s tech crackdown cooling HK’s IPO market,"NEW Hong Kong listings tumbled to their lowest since the aftermath of the global financial crisis, as weaker markets and China’s clampdown on its biggest tech firms chill sentiment.Just seven companies have gone public in the second quarter so far -- on track for the fewest since 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The muted second-quarter activity stands in sharp contrast to the rush to go public seen last year or even at the start of 2021.First-day performances have also struggled: May’s initial public offerings - which includes warehouse and distribution company JD Logistics Inc. and property manager Central China Management Co. - delivered the worst average debut performance in 15 months, the data show.The cool-off comes as China slapped a record fine on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and ordered 34 of its largest tech companies to rectify any anti-competitive business practices.That’s making some firms more skittish about going public and investors worry about further actions from regulators. China has said the moves are to protect consumers and maintain financial stability.""Investors are no longer comfortable paying sky-high valuations for some companies, ” said Louis Tse, Hong Kong-based managing director at Wealthy Securities Ltd. ""Because of the intervention of the government, some issuers will have to revise down their multiples.”China’s top-three tech firms Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Meituan have lost more than $400 billion in value from highs just four months ago.Hong Kong’s stock market tumbled into a technical correction earlier this year, dragging valuations further. The benchmark Hang Seng Index is one of the world’s worst performers since its February high.As a result, capital raised on the Hong Kong stock exchange this year is only half of its levels last year, impacting the city’s position as a top fundraising hub. In comparison, volume on the Nasdaq has already surpassed its 2020 number, thanks to a boom in blank-check company listings earlier this year.Growth TrapWorries about rising inflation are also making tech firms going public a harder sell as investors dump shares with rich valuations. Beijing’s scrutiny on firms including technology and education has also forced investors to scale back earnings forecasts, investors say.""We have seen some volatility and that has reflected on investors’ appetite, but deals that are priced appropriately will get done, ” said Francesco Lavatelli, head of equity capital markets for the Asia Pacific region at JPMorgan Chase & Co..Fintech firm Bairong Inc. slumped 16% when it began trading in late March, while health-care company Zhaoke Ophthalmology Ltd. dropped 15% in late April. JD Logistics Inc., which raised $3.2 billion, closed only 3% above its offering price in its debut recently in contrast to another JD.com unit, JD Health International Inc., which surged 56% on its first day last year.Next BlockbusterThe test for whether Hong Kong’s IPO market can stage a revival will come from some upcoming listings, which include share sales by a dairy firm and a maker of invisible teeth aligners.Large listings include China Youran Dairy Group Ltd., backed by dairy giant Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Co., as well as Betta Pharmaceuticals Co. Angelalign Technology Inc., China’s leading invisible orthodontic producer, launched an IPO of as much as $375 million on Thursday. The latter’s retail tranche was already about 674 times oversubscribed on its first day of order-taking, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported.Investors are also closely watching the reception to mega flotations, among them Chinese gaming giant NetEase Inc.’s music streaming arm which filed late May for a Hong Kong IPO that could raise about $1 billion.""The market needs at least two or three blockbuster IPOs to revive the sentiment. That means you need both subscription ratio and first-day performance to surprise the market on the upside, ” said Kenny Wen, Everbright Sun Hung Kai strategist.

The move extends its downtrend for a second day after a cryptic tweet from Elon Musk that hinted at a potential split with the cryptocurrency.Weibo, a Chinese social-media service, appears to have blocked some crypto influencer accounts on Saturday, citing violation of unspecified laws and Weibo community rules. While Weibo has cracked down on various crytocurrency-related accounts in the past years, the news came on top of recent harsh Chinese regulatory rhetoric that have already led to a plunge in prices for many digital coins.Meanwhile, El Salvador president Nayib Bukele said he plans to submit legislation that will make Bitcoin legal tender in the country, a first in the world, according to a video message he gave to the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami.Square Inc. said Saturday it will invest $5 million to build a solar-powered Bitcoin mining facility at a Blockstream Mining site in the U.S. through a partnership with the blockchain technology provider.Weekends in recent months have been rocky for crypto, which trade every day of the week.

""You don’t have institutional players involved as much, it’s not as liquid a market as it is during the week.”Musk has agitated Bitcoin and other digital coins with his social media posts. On Saturday, he tweeted that ""Goods & Services are the real economy, any form of money is simply the accounting thereof.”Bitcoin is struggling to break above its 20-day moving average -- it failed to do so on Thursday and Friday -- and is having a hard time advancing toward $40,000. If the coin were to breach that round-number level, it would probably test its 200-day moving average of around $41,500, something many chartists would consider a bullish catalyst.However, as Bitcoin continues to fluctuate in a narrow range, a retest of the $30,000 level could also be in play until more positive catalysts emerge.Earlier: Bitcoin’s Wild Weekends Turn Efficient Market Theory Inside OutStill, many point out that the crypto space has always been volatile. Its price swings -- up and down -- are a characteristic of the market, they argue, and many of its long-term investors are undaunted by its fickle day-to-day swings.""Our investor base has experienced market volatility many times and they know that this comes with the territory -- the ability for there to be pretty pronounced movements in price are native to investing in crypto, particularly at this point in crypto’s life cycle, ” said Michael Sonnenshein, CEO at Grayscale Investments.

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",8:27 AM MYT,Business,,Tech giants and tax havens targeted by historic G7 deal,"LONDON: The United States, Britain and other large, rich nations reached a landmark deal on Saturday to squeeze more money out of multinational companies such as Amazon and Google and reduce their incentive to shift profits to low-tax offshore havens.Hundreds of billions of dollars could flow into the coffers of governments left cash-strapped by the COVID-19 pandemic after the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies agreed to back a minimum global corporate tax rate of at least 15%.Facebook said it expected it would have to pay more tax, in more countries, as a result of the deal, which comes after eight years of talks that gained fresh impetus in recent months after proposals from U.S. President Joe Biden's new administration.""G7 finance ministers have reached a historic agreement to reform the global tax system to make it fit for the global digital age,"" British finance minister Rishi Sunak said after chairing a two-day meeting in London.The meeting, hosted at an ornate 19th-century mansion near Buckingham Palace in central London, was the first time finance ministers have met face-to-face since the start of the pandemic.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the ""significant, unprecedented commitment"" would end what she called a race to the bottom on global taxation.German finance minister Olaf Scholz said the deal was ""bad news for tax havens around the world"".Yellen also saw the G7 meeting as marking a return to multilateralism under Biden and a contrast to the approach of U.S. President Donald Trump, who alienated many U.S. allies.""What I've seen during my time at this G7 is deep collaboration and a desire to coordinate and address a much broader range of global problems,"" she said.Ministers also agreed to move towards making companies declare their environmental impact in a more standard way so investors can decided more easily whether to fund them, a key goal for Britain.TAXING TIMESCurrent global tax rules date back to the 1920s and struggle with multinational tech giants that sell services remotely and attribute much of their profits to intellectual property held in low-tax jurisdictions.Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice-president for global affairs and a former British deputy prime minister, said: ""We want the international tax reform process to succeed and recognise this could mean Facebook paying more tax, and in different places.""But Italy, which will seek wider international backing for the plans at a meeting of the G20 in Venice next month, said the proposals were not just aimed at U.S. firms.Yellen said European countries would scrap existing digital services taxes which the United States says discriminate against U.S. businesses as the new global rules go into effect.""There is broad agreement that these two things go hand in hand,"" she said.Key details remain to be negotiated over the coming months. Saturday's agreement says only ""the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises"" would be affected.European countries had been concerned that this could exclude Amazon - which has lower profit margins than most tech companies - but Yellen said she expected it would be included.How tax revenues will be split is not finalised either, and any deal will also need to pass the U.S. Congress.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he would push for a higher minimum tax, calling 15% ""a starting point"".Some campaign groups also condemned what they saw as a lack of ambition. ""They are setting the bar so low that companies can just step over it,"" Oxfam's head of inequality policy, Max Lawson, said.But Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe, whose country is potentially affected because of its 12.5% tax rate, said any global deal also needed to take account of smaller nations.The G7 includes the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.- Reuters"

But honestly, instead of always blaming the authorities for everything, why don’t we just take good care of ourselves first – follow the SOP, stay home and get vaccinated?The virus does not care who you are – anyone can get infected. And the only way we can get out of this immense disaster is for everyone to all work together.Some of the world’s leaders still think that this virus can easily be “killed”, and instead of caring for the people, they focus on their own political interests.The same goes for some of the people too – instead of following the rules and trying their best to curb the spread of Covid-19, a few make light of the seriousness of the pandemic and simply do as they please.In India, where the B1617 variant of the virus was discovered, the situation was really bad at some point. But now, our percentage of cases per capita is higher than that in India; we actually sit on the top of the chart now. Do you still believe that you and your family are doing enough to stay safe?On May 29, the number of new infections in Malaysia was 9,020. A day later, there were 1,114 Covid-19 patients in intensive care units. The country’s medical resources are already stretched to the limit, and as a result, our healthcare workers need to work even harder to make sure every patient is properly cared for. I can understand just how worried they must feel!These days there are more cases of young people getting infected too. And not just that, there are also more young patients who have died because of the virus. You may have also heard of someone’s family member or friend who got infected after attending a casual get-together with other folks, and then passing away a few days later.Sometimes we hope that all these stories are just “fake news” but unfortunately, more often than not they are real.ALSO READ: Five findings on Covid-19 vaccine confidence (or lack of)My friend BKL tells me that the situation is actually worse than we can imagine.

Did you know that you are required to pay a deposit of between RM50,000 and RM100,000 for a stay at some private hospitals as a Covid-19 patient?Needless to say, there are plenty of unforeseen incurred expenses.This new lockdown is different from the movement control order phases that we’ve had previously. Our total daily cases and death toll has increased drastically – and is still increasing – so rules have tightened, and everyone is doing their very best to stay home at all times.Although I agree with the government’s decision to strike a balance between the country’s economy and public health, I do feel there are other things that they can do to help the situation.As for the tourism industry, it is sinking further and further each day. Since last September, domestic travels have been halted, and there is no end in sight as to when the travel ban will actually get lifted.Tourism is not an essential industry, and therefore is not on the government’s priority rescue list. This means that our recovery is dependent on how well the government and the rakyat work together to defeat the pandemic.ALSO READ: Vaccines 99.99% effective in preventing breakthrough Covid-19I’m actually more concerned about the livelihoods of tour guides and professional tour leaders because they have become increasingly vulnerable. You may not realise that unlike most regular wage earners with fixed monthly incomes, they are mostly contract workers who are paid per job assignment. They don’t have fixed incomes or an Employee Provident Fund (EPF) account.Thanks to the booming global travel industry over the past decade, some tour guides have taken loans from banks to buy houses and cars in hopes of enhancing the quality of life for their families. No one would have expected that all of a sudden they would lose their jobs and incomes, making it hard for them to sustain themselves.Sure, most of them have been living on a tight budget, or have started doing other jobs. But this new wave of Covid-19 infections is making things even worse for everyone.I myself am actually among those walking on a tightrope right now. Yet, I still keep thinking of ways we can help these tour guides and leaders who have contributed so much to the tourism industry.Fortunately those in the industry who have lost their jobs are willing to take up any job available, in order to survive. What they worry about more is that the pandemic could trigger an economic depression that will wipe out any potential job opening. And tourism operators worldwide are facing the same insurmountable challenge.Anyway, bear in mind that we must take all the necessary precautions to stop this virus from getting to us and our families. We must adequately equip ourselves so that when the industry recovers one day, we can fight along together once again!The views expressed are entirely the writer’s own.Leesan, the founder of Apple Vacations, has travelled to 132 countries, six continents and enjoys sharing his travel stories and insights.

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,ANDREAS KLUTH,Naomi Osaka is a role model,"GOLF is a game of inches, said Arnold Palmer, one of the sport’s greatest players. He added: “The most important are the six inches between your ears.”The same is true of tennis, and indeed almost any sport, not to mention the rest of life. Athletes may spend most of their time cultivating their bodies. But the wise ones know that what matters most is the mind.That’s why I’m cheering and rooting for Naomi Osaka, the 23-year-old tennis prodigy who’s just pulled out of the French Open. What she realised was that her mind had become a dark place that she needed to take care of. Many of us should be that honest – and follow her example.The details of Osaka’s withdrawal are more complex, of course. She hated having to “do the press” after matches, as stars are contractually obliged. So she informed the tournament’s organisers that she wouldn’t. Rather high-handedly, they fined her a packet and threatened to boot her. She decided not to play their game.The backstory, as she described it in a very personal post on social media, is about mental health, and her struggles with it. Since defeating Serena Williams in the dramatic final of the 2018 US Open, Osaka’s been suffering bouts of depression. A self-diagnosed introvert, she also said she feels anxiety in social situations. To block out the negativity, she wears headphones.But in those post-game pressers, she’s exposed to the pack of hounds known as journalists. Almost any polite question you can ask in a sports presser is banal, so some hacks go negative and needle players who may have just had their dreams shattered or are trying to get their confidence back. Why can’t you win on clay? What’s wrong with your serve? Will you find your groove?Now put yourself into the mind of the athlete. It’s easy to do, even for us amateurs. I also play tennis, and I’ve spent decades interrogating my mind, besides discussing it with coaches. There’s a lot going on in there. And when you’re trying to get into your game head, the last thing you want is to hang out in a press conference.Take, for instance, the following paradox in tennis. The only stroke over which the opponent has no direct influence is the serve. So it should be the easiest. To initiate it, all you have to do is toss the ball above your head.But a lot of players will tell you that’s the hardest part. The reason is that for a split second you’re all alone with your mind. When you’re returning a stroke, a ball is coming toward you and you have no choice but to focus. When you’re tossing it in the air, it’s all you. And that’s when things go wrong. Doubt creeps in. You hold your breath, one finger tenses, the toss spins the wrong way, the rest is embarrassing.Incidentally, the worst thing to say to athletes who struggle with doubt is “think positive.” Sure, there’s a long tradition, at least since the “positive psychology” movement that started in the 1990s, of pretending we can overwrite all our mental negativity with deliberate optimism expressed in “affirmations.” Research has shown that this canned positivity works reliably only for people who are already upbeat.People who are pessimistic, by contrast, can tell themselves how great they are, but part of their minds won’t believe it, which makes them even more anxious. Worse, they may end up blaming themselves for their negativity, because they failed to reprogram themselves.This is also common in Buddhist and Yogic meditation, especially for competitive Westerners. I was once told to sit in Lotus and make my mind still by not thinking. A few seconds in, the thoughts gushed in. I was bad at this, I realised. If I was at the outset only my usual cranky self, I was furious by the time I unwrapped my legs.The solution – as many Yogis and, increasingly, psychologists agree – is not to try to think positive, but simply to observe the thoughts and label them. The same is true when our backhand keeps going into the net: Simply observe, and keep an open mind. The late psychologist Christopher Peterson called this “realistic optimism.”For most athletes, all this can take place on the court and during the game, or in the locker room just before. Osaka, however, had obviously crossed into a darker mental landscape. And in this respect, she’s like the huge and growing numbers of young adults who, especially in this pandemic, are much more at risk of depression and anxiety than older people.What should our message to these youngsters be? Suck it up, go back out on the court and then to the press conference? That’s a great way to make things worse. No, far better for them to label their suffering, as Osaka did. We want them to take the time and accept the help they need, before it gets too bad.The goal, in sports and life, is always the same: a balanced mind. Osaka didn’t have that, and realised she wasn’t going to get it while being part of this circus. Good for her. – Bloomberg"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,,South Korea to push for ‘use-by dates’ to cut food waste,"THE Food and Drug Safety Ministry of South Korea recently said that it would take steps to replace sell-by dates with the use-by dates in the country in an effort to give food a longer shelf life and reduce food waste.Sell-by dates on food products indicate the period of time said products can be distributed and sold. But use-by dates show how long products can be stored for and still used.The latter often lasts longer than the former, though sell-by dates are what is currently used in the country.Milk, for instance, often has a 10-day sell-by date. But a 2009 study by the Korea Consumer Agency found that it can last up to 50 days. The study also found that sliced cheese is safe to consume up to 70 days after its sell-by date.The ministry said it would seek to revise related laws including the Act on Labelling and Advertising of Foods as part of steps to introduce a longer expiry date.“Though food is still safe to consume after its sell-by date, consumers see it as a point after which food need to be thrown away, wasting consumable food products as a result, ” one official at the Food Ministry said.“By introducing a use-by date, it will contribute to reducing food waste and greenhouse gas emissions, helping protect the environment.”According to a study published in academic journal Science, food accounted for nearly 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. Some 18% of the greenhouse gas emissions were generated in the supply chain, the study showed.The ministry also explained use-by dates have been adopted by other OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation) countries including the European Union and Japan.In a study released in February, the Korea Food Service Industry Research, nearly 7 in 10 restaurant owners agreed that a sell-by date needs to be replaced with a use-by date, citing less confusion and a drop in food waste costs.The Food Ministry also said it would expand the range of edible insects eligible as food raw materials as part of efforts to secure more meat substitute protein products.To help recycle food product packaging, the ministry will also change rules to allow recycled plastics to be used to make containers following a review as early as January next year. – The Korea Herald/Asia News Network"

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",9:39 PM MYT,Asean+,,Singapore’s Hyflux faces liquidation after investor talks fail,"SINGAPORE, June 5 (Bloomberg): Singapore’s highest-profile distressed company Hyflux Ltd. is headed for a potential piecemeal selloff of its assets, capping a years-long saga that has left retail investors and creditors in the lurch.The judicial manager in charge of the water treatment company since November said that ""the remaining value of the Hyflux Group are best realized in a liquidation,” according to a statement late Friday.Such a move would aid the sale of individual assets after negotiations with a potential investor to take over the entire group failed, the manager Borrelli Walsh Ltd. said.Hyflux -- founded by Olivia Lum, an orphan who went from abject poverty to build one of Singapore’s most successful home-grown brands -- was behind the country’s biggest desalination plant opened in 2013. The company’s fortunes began to unravel in the following years as it stretched its balance sheet to expand in the Middle East and in the power generation sector.The company began a court-supervised debt restructuring process in 2018 and faced about S$2.8 billion (US$2.1 billion) of investor claims. It had received seven offers from investors, including the bid for the entire group, the judicial manager said last month.The remaining six bids involve purchase of individual assets in Hyflux Group and can be facilitated through a winding up of the company, according to the statement Friday.Continuation of the judicial management is no longer necessary and the managers on Friday filed an application to court to wind up the company.Read more details hereAbout 34,000 individual investors had put money into the once-highflying firm before its stumble, in the days when Olivia Lum had been likened to an Elon Musk of Singapore.Such investors, who bought products including perpetual notes and preference shares, had last year expressed concern about recovering much of any money. - Bloomberg"
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,GURMEET KAUR,Making cents out of solar,"A SUDDEN and steep rise in the cost for solar panels seems to have thrown a spanner in the works of the burgeoning solar power industry.All this while, the success of the industry, which captures energy from the sun and converts it into electricity, has been its gradually lowering costs and its green credentials – reasons which have made it the fastest-growing power source in the world.But now, solar panels or module prices have risen 18% since the start of the year after the cost had fallen dramatically over the past decade.Locally, a flurry of listed companies have also jumped into this space, banking that it is the next big growth industry due to the global shift towards renewable energy (RE).Following the rise in the cost of solar panels, one issue relates to the impact on local large-scale solar (LSS) power energy projects, the latest being the LSS4, which was awarded about two months ago.The increase in the cost of solar panels is due to the rise in the raw materials that go into making them as well as freight charges due to Covid-19.Polysilicon, an essential material in solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing, is seeing a severe supply squeeze, which is good for suppliers but not so good for solar manufacturers.Prices of polysilicon, for example, have jumped from US$6.19 (RM25.63) per kg to US$25.88 (RM107.17) per kg in less than a year, according to German research firm Bernreuter Research.Prices of other materials in the production of a PV cell and module – such as copper, iron-ore and aluminium – have also soared, fuelled by a global demand recovery as some economies bounce back from the Covid-19 pandemic and the energy transition trend, which serves major economies’ carbon neutralisation targets.Part of the reason for the price hikes in solar panels is the United States, where President Joe Biden had unveiled a massive infrastructure stimulus that involved catalysing investments into green energy projects such as solar power.Research analysts tracking the global solar industry point out that the disruption taking place has not been this bad over the last decade and said that project owners and governments are going to have to stop expecting solar to get much cheaper quickly.A recent Bloomberg report said the higher prices may delay some large-scale projects in the United States to Canada, China and India.Hence the question: How will this development impact Malaysia’s green energy goals?Malaysia’s installed solar power capacity has been experiencing a “superior” compounded annual growth rate of more than 50% in the last five years, points out Kenanga Research in a recent report.By 2025, the country has a target of achieving 31% RE in the power capacity mix, from the previous goal of 20%, to be mainly driven by growth in new solar PV capacities.The RE capacity mix for Malaysia is projected to increase to 40% by 2035, according to the Peninsular Malaysia Generation Development Plan 2021-2039, which was released by the Energy Commission in March. During this horizon, the combined share of gas and coal is foreseen to drop from 82% to 69%.Temporary phenomenonThe Energy and Natural Resources Ministry, in a reply to StarBizWeek, believes that the hike in material costs of solar PV is “a temporary phenomenon”.“Therefore, it shall not have a long-term impact on efforts to attain the RE target, which the government has set forth, ” it adds.To achieve the 31% goal, 1,178 megawatt (MW) of new RE capacities will be developed in Peninsular Malaysia from 2021 onwards, the generation development plan indicates.The additional capacities will consist of 1,098MW of solar and 80MW of non-solar.Currently, RE contributes 15% for the energy mix for Peninsular Malaysia, while for the whole of Malaysia, it stands at 22%.Malaysia has been moving towards large-scale solar projects since 2016 with the commissioning of LSS projects.The LSS4, which has the largest capacity under this scheme, is touted as an engine for the country’s post-Covid comeback where RM4bil in investment is expected to be unblocked and 12,000 new jobs created.The 30 winning bids announced for LSS4 – 500MW awarded under Package P2 and 323MW under Package P1 – had tariffs ranging from 17.68 sen to 24.81 sen per kilowatt hour (kWh). That is the price at which the applicant intends to sell their solar-generated electricity into the country’s electricity grid, while still making the venture a profitable one. The developers have until the end of 2023 to get their plants connected to the grid.It should be noted that those tariffs are lower than what companies had proposed in the earlier iterations of large-scale solar projects. The reason is that solar panel costs have generally been on a downward slide over the years, coupled with enhanced efficiencies of new panels that are able to generate more electricity per panel.During LSS1, the lowest bid was 39 sen per kWh; for LSS2, the lowest bid was 33.98 sen per kWh; while for LSS3, it stood at 17.78 sen per kWh.It should also be noted that not all winning bidders of the earlier LSS schemes have been able to complete their projects on time.Large-scale solar projects have their fair share of challenges because of unattractive rates and the requirement for vast tracts of land, which has resulted in the solar plants being located far away from the main grid.For LSS4, analysts have said that they projected participating companies would be able to achieve an internal rate of return (IRR) from mid-to-high single-digits and that capital expenditure would hover around RM3mil to RM4mil per MW of capacity being installed.However, these numbers are likely to be affected by the recent increase in solar panel costs.Unlike LSS3, which comprised five shortlisted bidders with Cypark Resources Bhd being the only public listed winner, LSS4 had seen a much larger pool of beneficiaries from a diverse mix of sectors. This included a consortium comprising Tan Chong Motor Holdings Bhd, APM Automotive Bhd and Warisan TC Holdings Bhd (all belonging to the Tan Chong group), which is the first automotive group to be successful in an LSS bid.The other listed beneficiaries are Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB), Ranhill Utilities Bhd, Uzma Bhd, JAKS Resources Bhd, Gopeng Bhd, KPower Bhd, Solarvest Holdings Bhd, Advancecon Holdings Bhd and MK Land.Players have different advantages and disadvantagesSeasoned solar power entrepreneur Boumhidi Abdelali (Adel) explains that solar panels make up almost half of the cost in starting up a solar power plant. “It is the single-largest cost item, so naturally, with prices up, this will impact your project numbers, ” he explains.“This is why it is important to take into account the prices of solar panels and projections of how high it can rise to, by reading the global marketplace. If you do not factor future price rises (of solar panels), then this could potentially be a problem that could impede the viability of your project, ” he says.Adel is the managing director of reNIKOLA group of companies which has been involved in solar power plants since 2015. The reNIKOLA group is being injected into listed firm Pimpinan Ehsan Bhd.In addition to LSS programmes, reNIKOLA’s growth plans include supplying solar energy to private companies, such as multinational firms, via TNB’s grid. When asked what impact the spike in solar panel prices will have on reNIKOLA’s business, Adel says: “Yes, there will be minimal impact on profitability. But at the same time, we have a bit more room and headway and are confident of our numbers and profit margins. We have been a bit more conservative from the start”.Industry experts say while the bidding process was good, it unfortunately does not take into consideration the time to market, unless it is a significant player with a lot of rolling stock of panels, for example. On the other hand, new players would not have had the basis to buy stock on the assumption that they would win the bid.Solarvest’s group CEO Davis Chong (pic below) says with solar modules representing some 40%-60% of the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning (EPCC) value of a solar project, any movement in prices will inevitably have a direct impact on its project costs.Listed in late 2019, Solarvest provides turnkey EPCC and operations and maintenance (O&M) services for solar systems and power plants in the country.It is also the owner of a 1MWp solar PV plant in Kedah.Chong says the price hikes were mainly driven by a shortage of raw materials and strong demand within China as solar players there are expediting their installation to meet the 2021 target of adding 55 gigawatts (GW) to 65GW of solar PV capacity in China.“One way to mitigate this is by implementing our value engineering expertise which includes optimising the solar plant design and using high-quality substitute materials which do not compromise on safety and performance for components such as cables and other construction materials, ” he tells StarBizWeek.That said, he too sees the situation to be a temporary one, posing a short-term challenge to the industry.He foresees the demand-supply curve to be more stable in 2022.“We anticipate that some solar project owners may delay the delivery timeline due to the temporary increase in solar module prices right now. Once prices normalise, the installation process will accelerate accordingly, ” he says.As for its LSS4 projects, he sees minimal impact as the projects are only scheduled to come on stream in 2022 and 2023.“There is still some room. Reason being, the purchase of the solar modules are usually done nearer to the tail end of a project, by which time we anticipate prices would have returned to normal levels, ” Chong says.Samaiden Group Bhd group managing director Chow Pui Hee believes that “solar projects are still viable, although the return on investment of the project developer would be affected”.Listed in October 2020, Samaiden is primarily an EPCC provider of solar panels systems and power plants and have carved a track record following contract wins from the LSS1 and LSS2 schemes.reNIKOLA’s Adel says that each player has different advantages and disadvantages.“All will be impacted, some more than others, ” he says. Variables include solar panel stocks in hand, the ability to bulk purchase and balance sheet strength, he points out.While no one knows for sure how long the price rise in solar panels will be, or if it will trend higher before stabilising at some point, most industry players remain confident that solar power remains attractive, relevant and its growth will not cease.A bright future“Solar is a key component of Malaysia RE space. The rising demand for clean energy among the multinational companies, coupled with the rollout of government-backed programmes, are set to stimulate growth in the local market, ” says Pimpinan Ehsan executive director Lim Beng Guan.On its part, upon completion of reNIKOLA acquisition, Lim says the group plans to aggressively expand in the RE sector and aims to own and operate one gigawatt of RE assets in the future.“The plan is to first expand our solar portfolio. Gradually, the company is looking to expand into different verticals within the green energy sector, “ Lim adds.Notwithstanding the competition, Solarvest’s Chong believes that solar investments will continue to be in demand.“It is an affordable and reliable source of RE, providing investors with earnings visibility and stable recurring income over the long-term tenure of 21 years as per the power purchase agreement, ” he adds.Moreover, he says the short-term increase in solar modules is offset by lower financing costs and attractive government tax incentives. This continues to make solar investments a bankable industry.“In addition to economic benefits, the environmental, social and governance (ESG) push has also been the driver for adoption among multinational corporations.“We believe the increase in material costs will not be a big hindrance in the movement towards clean energy, ” adds Chong.Both Solarvest and Samaiden are eyeing regional expansion. Kenanga Research in a recent report noted that Solarvest is eyeing further forays into the Philippines and Taiwan, where its channel checks suggest that EPCC rates in the latter are higher at 12%-15% versus Malaysia’s LSS of 10%-12%.In April last year, Solarvest secured its maiden contracts in the Philippines via two small EPCC projects. Meanwhile, in Taiwan, the group recently acquired a 51%-stake in Tailai Energy Co Ltd as a local partner, with operations expected to start by the middle of this year.Together with its local partner, it will bid for rooftop feed-in-tariff projects.As for Samaiden, the company is currently participating in some regional tenders including in Vietnam, which is leading the way in RE adoption in the region.“In Vietnam, we have set up offices and is in the midst of negotiating and tendering for some rooftop solar EPCC works together with local partners.“Regional prospect of RE/solar is very encouraging, evidenced by the increasing of RE mixed target for the countries, ” Chow adds.Meanwhile, Pekat Group Bhd, which is en route to a listing on Bursa Malaysia’s ACE Market, aims to grow its market share in the solar industry in the country.The solar PV as well as earthing and lightning protection (ELP) specialist seeks to raise RM44.4mil from its listing to expand its solar PV and ELP businesses to take advantage and capture the anticipated growth in the local solar industry in the near future.For 2021, the International Energy Association (IEA) expects renewables to regain momentum with delayed projects coming back online.In its latest market update released last month, it said that renewables were the only energy source for which demand increased in 2020 despite the pandemic, while consumption of all other fuels declined.It expects solar PV development to continue to break records, with annual additions reaching 162 GW by 2022 – almost 50% higher than the pre-pandemic level of 2019.China remains at the centre of global renewable demand and supply, accounting for around 40% of global renewable capacity growth for several years. The country is also the largest manufacturer of solar panels and wind turbines, as well as the biggest supplier of raw materials such as silicon, glass, steel, copper and rare earth materials needed to build them.Supply chain constraints, including due to a fire in a Chinese silicon factory last year, have recently pushed up prices of PV modules, highlighting the sector’s potential vulnerabilities, adds IEA."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,GANESHWARAN KANA,More support needed for M40 group,"A fresh stimulus package of RM40bil was announced earlier this week, on top of the RM100bil yet to be utilised from the previously announced packages.The Pemerkasa Plus package is the government’s immediate response to the impact from the ongoing lockdown, despite the country’s limited ability to spend and its high debt burden.However, the stimulus package has drawn criticism from some quarters, who said that the middle 40% (M40) income group has been sidelined, with insufficient measures targeted towards this population.Among those criticising are politicians from both sides of the divide and a key contention is whether the loan moratorium should be extended to the M40 group.In addition, some feel that one-off cash handouts should also be given to the M40 households besides the B40 population.M40 refers to those households with a monthly income of RM4,850 to RM10,959, according to the Statistics Department.Experts agree that not all M40 individuals are affected by the crisis, but they feel that more measures are needed to support this income group in order to boost Malaysia’s economic recovery.Speaking with StarBizWeek, AmBank Group chief economist Anthony Dass says there is a need to focus on the M40 group, given that their living costs are much higher in the urban areas.“For instance, a trader who has lost his income substantially due to the movement control order (MCO) is not eligible to receive any aid, should his spouse’s income fall into the M40 category.“Certainly this will add strong pressure on those affected, ” he says.Dass adds that the M40 should be given automatic moratorium as opposed to the current model where one needs to prove job loss or pay cuts.Other support measures, for M40 suggested by Dass, include e-Wallet credit and raising the discount on electricity charges which is currently given at 10%.“There must be consistency in policies for aid. It means that the affected households should continue to receive support until we reached the vaccination target.“Otherwise, we will have ad hoc policies whenever MCOs are imposed.“They will only cause greater difficulties for households, ” according to Dass.Alliance Bank chief economist Manokaran Mottain says that more measures are expected for the M40 population.While he believes that one-off cash handouts are unnecessary for the group, he says that other support measures should be introduced.“Overall, the Pemerkasa Plus did not completely sideline the M40. For example, those from the M40 group who have lost their jobs or took a pay cut, would benefit from the loan moratorium, ” Manokaran (pic above) points out.Permatang Pasir assemblyman Muhammad Faiz Fadzil concurs that there are some measures under the Pemerkasa Plus that would benefit the M40 group.“But the question is whether it is adequate considering the economic challenges faced by almost everyone today.“Having a RM5,000 monthly household income would put you in the M40 group, but if you are living in the Klang Valley, chances are the amount is not sufficient, ” he says.Muhammad Faiz suggested tweaking the loan moratorium and cash handouts.He says the initiatives should be made available to all M40 individuals on a means-tested basis or based on certain criteria such as the number of children or the location of domicile.“Yes, the government’s fiscal capacity is limited, but by putting more cash into the pockets of the population, it can stimulate the economy by boosting private consumption.“That is a remedy for our soft economic conditions, ” adds Muhammad Faiz.The movement restrictions since last year have delivered a big blow to consumer-appetite in the country.During the first round of the MCO last year, the Statistics Department found that the average monthly household expenditure fell 55% from RM6,317 to RM2,813.MCA Youth chief Datuk Nicole Wong Siaw Ting, in a letter to The Star, said that the wing had received public feedback that the M40 group has been sidelined in the Pemerkasa Plus package.She said nobody is immune to the lockdown effects and recommends that a special personal income tax relief for the M40 by introduced by the government.“The government’s concern for the low-income groups and affected sectors is indeed understandable.“However, it is still in the early stage of the total lockdown, and the government still has time to ensure that its measures will benefit more layers of society, ” stated Wong.Meanwhile, Sunway University economics professor Yeah Kim Leng (pic above) says a severe and prolonged lockdown would require additional stimulus measures, on top of the RM380bil announced.Commenting on the Pemerkasa Plus package, Yeah opines that a bolder and larger package would have enabled the distressed households to better cope with income and job losses.It would also minimise the possible “scarring effect” of the prolonged crisis that could have affected the vulnerable segments of the M40 group, especially those that have lost their means of livelihood due to retrenchments or business shutdowns.“Use big data and data analytics, as well as self-reporting and means-testing systems to identify the distressed M40 households, especially those with many dependents, so that they can receive the appropriate government support, ” he says.Yeah points out that cash handouts are the most efficient way to assist the vulnerable B40 and M40 households, since typically 80% to 100% of the cash handouts are spent on essential goods and services.However, he highlighted that some portion of the cash handouts received may end up in savings, rather than consumption.“As evident in China and other western and middle-easten countries, the key to unleashing the pent-up demand among the upper M40 and top 20% income groups is by the suppression of the virus and death rates, ” he tells StarBizWeek.Since early 2020, the economic stimulus packages announced by the government have benefitted over 20 million citizens and 2.4 million businesses, according to the Laksana report.To date, almost 60% of the initiatives have been disbursed, comprising direct cash assistance such as Bantuan Prihatin Nasional, Geran Khas Prihatin, Wage Subsidy Programme and various other measures to protect the rakyat and ensure business continuity.Meanwhile, from the approved allocation of RM322.5bil under Budget 2021, RM117.5bil has been spent as of April.According to the latest Laksana report, among the Budget 2021 measures that are being implemented are the welfare assistance to vulnerable groups such as bedridden senior citizens, poor families and the disabled.It is noteworthy that welfare assistance allocation increased from RM1.5bil in 2020 to RM2.2bil in 2021.In addition, the implementation of the Jendela initiative with an allocation of RM500mil which, among others, will provide fibre connections for schools.“Other programmes funded by Budget 2021 development expenditure include a micro credit fund of almost RM1bil and a school maintenance programme, ” stated the report."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,GURMEET KAUR,Pursuing the carbon neutral agenda,"THE growth in demand to invest in companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) profile has gained pace as policymakers around the world drive a low-carbon economic transition to combat climate change.The Covid-19 pandemic has also raised public interest in sustainable living.Renewable energy (RE) company reNIKOLA Sdn Bhd’s managing director Boumhidi Abdelali (Adel) says green energy is a must for many corporations, going forward.“To attract more investments from global multinationals and funds, we must have green energy in the country’s ecosystem, ” the seasoned solar power entrepreneur says, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted many investors and bankers to seek and fund companies that will prosper in the new environment.“Globally, the world is swiftly moving towards renewable or clean energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuel. Despite the current pandemic, governments and businesses are pursuing decarbonisation plans.“In the United States alone, the new Biden administration plans to invest US$2 trillion (RM8.2 trillion) over four years to increase the use of clean energy. Closer to us, China has pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, with 60 other small countries aiming to do so by 2050, ” he adds.Towards this end, many oil and gas (O&G) firms are evolving into integrated energy companies.“The pursuit of clean energy has led to many O&G companies allocating much of their capex towards renewables, be it new investment, strategic partnership or collaborations, or the setting up a new business unit to make a greater push into this area, ” notes Maybank IB Research in an April report on ESG.It adds that many have also undertaken the merger and acquisition (M&A) route via acquiring large-scale solar projects to accelerate meeting carbon offsets targets. In the Malaysian O&G space, the majority are service providers and hence, pursuing a carbon neutral agenda will be a priority. In this aspect, the research firm says Yinson Holdings Bhd is ahead of its peers.Primarily a floating production, storage and offloading company operating within the upstream oil and gas sector, Yinson currently has a RE capacity of 330MV from its solar projects in India. It has a mid-term target of reaching 1GW of RE in two years, and a long-term target of 5GW in five years. In order to achieve these targets, the group has already planned a pipeline of markets in which it seeks to penetrate in the coming few years.Traditional utility providers, Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) and Malakoff Corp Bhd have also begun their respective renewables push. TNB aims to achieve 5GW RE capacity by 2025, worth RM33bil, which would contribute some RM2bil in earnings before interest and taxes.The potential spinning off its generation unit could improve its ESG profile, given its large exposure to coal-fuelled power plants now, which had possibly led to the exodus by foreign investors in the stock.By 2030, TNB expects coal-related revenue to drop to less than 20% of group revenue.Given the hefty capital outlay involved, balance sheet strength is a key – a factor that differentiates the company from many others.Similarly, Malakoff, which has had significant coal exposure, has embarked on small projects in solar, mini-hydro and biogas. The acquisition of Alam Flora Sdn Bhd in late 2019 has given the independent power producer an entry into waste management, which could pave the way for a possible expansion into waste-to-energy ventures.“Companies that invest along the low-carbon or environmental lines are likely to attract large private investors, such as pension funds, which are increasingly expected to operate with an eye on ESG credentials, but some do not provide the returns needed, ” says one analyst.Still, he thinks RE will continue to grow for its inherent environmental benefits, which far outweigh the adverse impacts of traditional energy sources.With backing from governments to encourage investments in this space, he says technology within the sector will continue to improve, and coupled with more competition, costs will come down over time."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,PANKAJ C KUMAR,The essential role of an audit,"THE powers and duties of an auditor are clearly defined under Section 266 of the Companies Act, 2016. Here, the law states that an auditor has a statutory duty to report to members with regards to the financial statements, company’s accounting and other records related to those financial statements.The auditor is also required to state in a report whether the financial statements presented give a true and fair view of the affairs of the company. An auditor is required to provide reasons if he or she is not satisfied with any matters related to the financial statements.The function of an auditor is also clearly defined in the code of corporate governance, which came about mainly due to corporate failures, losses, scandals, economic turmoil as well as demand from stakeholders.The origins of corporate governance itself can be traced back to the United States. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) led the early establishment of corporate governance among corporates when it required companies to have audit committees among listed companies.In the 1980s, as the US stock market was rapidly developing and more and more US companies saw the emergence of institutional investors, the demand from these investors grew as they wanted to have more say on how these corporates were run with greater accountability and transparency.The institutional demand grew louder in the 1990s but nothing materially changed until the Enron and WorldCom cases emerged in early 2000. These two corporate failures were the cornerstone of change when it came to corporate governance and the role of auditors.Fictitious accountingIn Enron’s case, it was revealed that the board failed to perform its duty as fictitious accounting and earnings were reported. The board was more concerned on the value of their shareholding, and to maintain Enron’s stock price, they effectively adopted strategies that were high risk and to ensure reported earnings can be managed to meet market expectations. Enron has since become a well-known example of wilful corporate fraud and corruption.The scandal also brought into question the accounting practices and activities of many corporations in the United States and was a factor in the enactment of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, 2002. The scandal also caused the dissolution of Arthur Andersen, one of the largest audit firms globally then.In Worldcom’s case, the company was caught using creative accounting in booking “line costs” (interconnection expenses with other telecommunication companies) as capital expenditures on the balance sheet instead of expenses and inflating revenues with bogus accounting entries from “corporate unallocated revenue accounts”.In recent times, we have seen some large financial scandals too involving companies like Wirecard of Germany, Luckin of China, or even Hin Leong from Singapore. Historically, Malaysia too has its fair share of scandals that has brought shame and ridicule. We have seen in the past how scandals like the Pan-El crisis of the 1980s or the case of Transmile’s accounting scandal in early 2007 cause significant losses to investors.In some of these cases, it is the management of the companies themselves who were involved but at the same time, the auditors too failed to detect early warning signs, until it was too late.One does not need to go very far as even in the case of 1MDB we had observed how auditors had performed their fiduciary duty as earlier appointed auditors could not complete their work, resulting in a change of auditors. When new auditors were brought in, despite vouching for the financial statements, they disowned their own opinions later on following the report from the Department of Justice (DoJ).The dynamics of the Serba sagaOver the past 10 days or so, the most talked about story in the financial market was that of Serba Dinamik. It all started on May 7,2021, when the company announced to Bursa Malaysia that it was changing its financial year from a December year-end to a June 2021 year-end, or effectively an 18-month financial period from its last audited accounts of Dec 31,2019, or the financial year 2019 (FY19).The reason cited by Serba based on stock exchange filing was “continuing extension of the movement control order (MCO) in Malaysia and lockdowns in countries in which the group have hampered the ability to finalise the group’s financial statements; expansion of groups operations in new countries further add to more time required to finalise financial statements; to facilitate better audit planning and allocation of resources to avoid the peak financial reporting period”The market took little attention to this change in year-end by the company but there were some red flags from here itself. For example, the company announced its full-year unaudited financial results for FY20 on February 26,2021. There was no mention about any change in the year-end then, and judging by the preceding year’s FY2019 timeline, Serba, after announcing the year-end results in that year, had issued its annual report (AR) on May 29,2020. In that AR, the auditors and directors had signed off the financial statements and the audit report on May 6,2020.Based on this, it does seem that the audit work carried out for FY20 by the auditors was well within the timeline set in previous years. It was only revealed to the market via Serba’s response to the exchange and an online corporate and media presentation done last Saturday, May 29,2021, that the audit matters were raised by the auditors on May 3,2021.Interestingly, in the FY19 audit report, the auditors had highlighted three key audit matters then and they include:> Existence, accuracy and completeness of revenue recognition;> Completeness and existence of material on-site amounting to RM908mil; and> Valuation of trade receivables and contract assets valued at RM1,526mil.In FY19, the auditors addressed these key audit matters via various methods and means to ensure the financial statements were accurately reflectively of the balances presented.Hence, on May 25,2021, to the surprise of the market, Serba announced that it was seeking suspension of trading of its shares as it was informed by its auditors “on some matters” on the statutory audit and at the same time the board announced that it is appointing an independent firm to commence a special independent review to assess the veracity and accuracy of the matters. Serba shares remained suspended for the rest of last week, pending the release of further information.On May 28,2021, Serba announced that it has received a special notice from a non-independent, non-executive director with a shareholding of 15.96% for the company to convene an EGM, to remove its current auditors and to appoint BDO PLT as new auditors of the company for the new financial year ending June 30,2021.On the same day, Serba also detailed out its response dated May 6,2021, on the key audit matters that were raised by its auditors three days before that, as explained earlier. Serba claims that while it has responded to the matters that were raised by the auditors, the auditors themselves have not reverted to the company.Last Saturday afternoon, in a rather unusual and rushed dissemination of information, Serba called for analysts/fund managers briefing as well as a separate media briefing on the chronology of events that has occurred. Serba must be applauded for making the effort to come clean and to explain to investors and the media its side of the story for the matters that were raised by the auditors.At the same time, we have also heard from Serba that the present auditors have reached out to independent directors of the company concerning the key audit matters. While it was not mentioned who these independent directors are, a quick check on the latest board of directors list suggests that Serba has nine board members, of which five are independent non-executive directors (INED), including one senior INED.The audit committee (AC) comprises four members, with the senior INED as chairman and two others being the INED. Only one of the AC members is a non-independent non-executive director. Hence, since the present auditor has reached out to the INED, it can be concluded that at least three of them are AC members. Of the three INED AC members, two are members of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) and one of them is a former partner of the present audit firm.There is indeed no reason to doubt as to why the auditors have reached out to the INED and in particular, the INED who are AC members, as they do understand and can comprehend the issues that have been raised by the auditor.In a late statement on Thursday, the INEDs too have expressed their concern on matters raised by the auditors and are taking steps to resolve the issues at hand, which include the appointment of an independent firm to assess the veracity and accuracy of the matters raised by the auditors, independently and objectively, without any element of interference from any party.The time to come clean is nowThe market doesn’t like uncertainty. At the time of writing, Serba’s share price was last seen at 83.5 sen as at Thursday’s close, or 48.1% lower than its pre-suspension price of RM1.61. Some RM2.89bil in market capitalisation has been wiped out due to the uncertainty created by this impasse between the board and the auditor.It has also wide repercussions for the company’s bonds as rating agencies have downgraded the debt papers. Regulators have stepped in to investigate the matter. With the pressure coming from various stakeholders as well as concerns raised by several institutional investors, the special notice issued earlier has since been withdrawn.Serba has taken measures to buy time by extending its accounting period to June 30 and this will allow the present auditors to complete the audit in time. While time is of the essence, and investigations carried out by the regulators may take time, it is also important for the market to hear from the auditors themselves as to their side of the story, especially now that the special notice has been withdrawn.After all, the issue at hand is related to audit matters and only they could put the record straight.Pankaj C. Kumar is a long-time investment analyst. The views expressed here are his own."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,CECILIA KOK,Recovery theme still at play,"DESPITE the implementation of the full movement control order (MCO), analysts are sticking to the recovery-focused investment theme for the second half of this year.They view the lockdown as merely a temporary setback, which may delay, but not derail Malaysia’s economy.They remain optimistic that the country’s economy will continue to recover from the Covid-19 fallout over the next six months, and this in turn, will lift cyclical sectors such as banking, energy, property and tourism.Most analysts also expect the benchmark FBM KLCI, which is composed of the 30 largest stocks by market capitalisation, to end 2021 on a stronger note.Maybank Investment Bank Research appeared the most bullish, maintaining its expectation of the FBM KLCI ending the year at 1,830 points, based on 16 times forward price-earnings ratio (PER).It explains that with recovery deferred, rather than derailed, by the latest spike in Covid cases, and vaccinations set to ramp up dramatically in the coming weeks, it is keeping its end-2021 FBM KLCI unchanged, supported by earnings recovery, ample market liquidity and relative attraction compared with fixed-income, as indicated by the wide earnings yield gap vis-à-vis the Malaysia Government Securities (MGS).The FBM KLCI closed 12.12 points lower at 1,578.45 yesterday. Year to date, the index has declined about 3%.Upgrading forecastOver the week, CGS-CIMB Research raised its end-2021 FBM KLCI target to 1,709 points from 1,699 points previously, following the end of the first-quarter corporate result season and despite the lockdown kicking in.The revised target is based on 15.1 times PER, which represented one standard deviation discount to historical average PER to reflect potential earnings risks in the second half of this year due to political instability.“If Malaysia makes good progress to vaccinate 70% of its targeted population by end-2021 to achieve herd immunity, it could re-rate the market, which currently trades at two standard deviation below historical mean.“However, if the country is not able to rein in the high Covid-19 cases, we see near-term downside risk of up to 123 points, ” CGS-CIMB Research says.It expects the market impact from the lockdown to be more muted compared to MCO 1.0, when the FBM KLCI plunged 5% on March 16 last year.CGS-CIMB Research points out that the availability of Covid-19 vaccines and the government’s plan to ramp up daily vaccination rates over the next six months; strong export sales by the technology, glove and commodity sectors; robust market liquidity; and low interest rates will support the performance of the FBM KLCI.The first of three phases of the nationwide lockdown, which started on June 1, is expected to end on June 14.CGS-CIMB Research concedes that the lockdown will dampen near-term sentiment for recovery sectors such as banking, automotive, property and retail, construction, real estate investment trust (REIT) and tourism-related plays, given concerns of earnings risks.This might prompt investors to temporarily switch to defensive names least affected by the renewed restrictions as Covid-19 cases subside or there is a significant pick-up in vaccination rate.Even so, CGS-CIMB Research’s top stock picks are still geared towards recovery play.Sustainable growthSimilarly, AmInvestment Bank Research (AmInvest) is also sticking to the recovery-focused investment theme, which it believes will extend well into 2021 from end-2020.“Investors will continue to accumulate recovery plays, that is, fundamentally strong names in the banking, power, oil and gas, consumer, REIT and transport sectors, while lightening their positions in pandemic plays such as glove makers and selected excessively priced technology names, ” the investment bank says.“We are not overly perturbed by the reintroduction of a nationwide lockdown as we believe a lockdown is the right thing to do to stamp out Covid-19 and enable the economy to emerge from the pandemic in a more sustainable manner.”In addition, the world at large is in a much better position in its fight against Covid-19 now as compared to a year ago, thanks to the availability of effective vaccines, AmInvest points out.In full swingAlso, a significant number of economic sectors will remain in full swing (or close to full swing) during the lockdown, and these include financial services, utilities, telecommunications, healthcare, plantation and production, processing and distribution of food items; or operate at 60% capacity such as manufacturing of electrical, electronic, petrochemical and pharmaceutical products and gloves.“As the pandemic gradually comes under control with a larger percentage of the Malaysian population being vaccinated, the fundamentals of banking stocks should improve.“Other key sectors that are poised to benefit from the recovery are power, oil and gas, seaport, airport, consumer and REIT, ” it addsAmInvest maintains its end-2021 FBM KLCI target at 1,695 points based on 16 times PER, representing a discount to its five-year historical average of 18 times.The discount is to mitigate the distortion arising from the earnings spikes from glove makers due to the abnormally high glove selling prices that are not recurring; and to factor in a higher perceived risk premium to reflect the dynamic political landscape including a potential 15th general election during the second half of this year.Buy on dipAccording to MIDF Research, the knee-jerk negative market reaction to the lockdown could present a buying opportunity for investors.“We remain sanguine for the remainder of 2021... the situation we currently face is different from last year. We expect that 2021 will see a recovery in the economy (albeit at a more moderate pace now).“Furthermore, we believe that the management of this headwinds will be better, given the experience governments and regulators have on dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, coupled to the expected acceleration of the vaccination programme, ” it says.MIDF Research maintains its end-2021 FBM KLCI baseline target at 1,700 points, as it expects the trajectory of forward earnings growth to recover in the final quarter of this year.Meanwhile, Public Investment Bank Research (PublicInvest) notes the market remains a trading-oriented one with volatile swings to be expected.Its end-2021 FBM KLCI target is kept unchanged at 1,690 points, based on 16 times forward PER.According to PublicInvest, the market at its current stage appears attractive from a long-term perspective, though not compelling as yet.“Market dynamics are evolving, with the expected market fervour now possibly delayed to the second half of 2021, owing to persistent setbacks. Significant market weakness should still be taken as an opportunity to accumulate however, though selectively, ” it says.The investment bank argues longer-term cyclical recovery plays such as banking, oil and gas, and construction appear to be delayed now, with the lockdown hitting near-term operations and earnings prospects.“Longer-term earnings are now subject to the length and severity of this lockdown.“At this point, we retain our ‘overweight’ stance on the manufacturing, technology, consumer, oil and gas, gaming and rubber glove sectors, ” it says."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,TENGKU DATUK SERI ZAFRUL AZIZ,Why use a sledgehammer to crack a nut?,"WE are currently in MCO 3.0 lockdown mode, and there have been calls by various parties for an automatic blanket moratorium, like what we had during MCO 1.0.First, a quick flashback. When we first instituted MCO 1.0, we understood so little of the virus, and with vaccines still a pipe dream, no one in the world knew how to contain it.Among the various measures through the Prihatin package, Bank Negara and the banking sector agreed to provide a six-month automatic blanket moratorium for all borrowers.Everyone enjoyed it, from the B40, M40 and T20, to businesses, big and small. Whether they needed it or not, the rich, the elite, big corporates and even companies recording massive profits, benefitted.After the moratorium ended in September 2020, approximately 85% of borrowers resumed repayments, a strong indication that most Malaysians were able to continue paying their borrowings.Since then, the banking sector has strategically focused on the 15% of borrowers who are struggling, by offering the option between a three-month moratorium or a six-month 50% reduction in repayment in Budget 2021, which were extended through subsequent aid packages like Permai, Pemerkasa and Pemerkasa Plus.A good number of borrowers have also been granted other repayment options specific to their financial circumstances.Fast forward a year, we are faced with MCO 3.0, another major economic-public health quagmire. The big difference is that this time, we know a lot more about the virus, and many companies managed to switch to work from home (WFH) mode quickly, while numerous businesses with e-commerce capabilities dialled up on their online offerings.Although infection numbers are higher than 2020, our national vaccination plan has also been accelerated to achieve 150,000 doses per day by end-June, setting us firmly on our path towards achieving herd immunity by end-2021.At the same time, thus far, we have channelled over RM200bil in assistance, benefitting 20 million Malaysians and 2.4 million businesses. The gross domestic product (GDP) for March 2021 was +6%, signalling good economic recovery.Further, in addition to the Budget 2021 initiatives worth RM322.5bil and the recently announced RM40bil Pemerkasa Plus aid package, more than RM100bil worth of ongoing measures are still available from previous packages to support the people, businesses and the economy.For borrowers, the banking sector’s Loan Repayment Assistance (LRA) is still available for jobless individuals (B40, M40 or T20); B40 recipients of Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat; Micro SMEs with facilities up to RM150,000; as well as SMEs and micro enterprises that are part of MCO 3.0 locked-down sectors.They can choose a three-month moratorium or a 50% reduction in monthly loan installment for six months.The LRA is also available to impacted M40 and T20 borrowers experiencing an income reduction. In all cases, borrowers just need to choose what relief they need and automatic approval will be given upon application.The banks have agreed that any distressed borrower will never be turned away during these tough times.Knowing that those who need temporary relief have options, and those who can afford it have resumed repayments, is a blanket moratorium the smart thing to reinstate, particularly when we know we must optimise our resources?Most of us agree that fighting this Covid-19 war is more of a marathon than a sprint. Hence, why are we using a sledgehammer to crack a nut? Why are we deploying more resources than necessary if we know the journey ahead could potentially be both long and challenging?Just because we can, doesn’t mean we shouldI was recently quoted in the media that the government cannot compel banks to give a blanket moratorium, and this was subsequently taken out of context by opportunistic quarters promoting their populist agenda. To clarify, under the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 (CBA) and the Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA), the Minister of Finance does not have the authority to instruct the banks to give an automatic moratorium. Further, under the current Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance 2021, any new legislation has to be approved by Cabinet and then presented to the Yang Dipertuan Agong for His Royal Highness’ assent.Section 4 of the Emergency Ordinance confers powers to the government to acquire and mobilise any resources necessary for public good, but Section 5 clearly stipulates that any compulsory measure by the government must be matched by a compensation to the party that has yielded its resources. In short, this cannot be done at zero cost to the government.But just because we can, does that mean we should? Repeating the blanket moratorium also means that the government may need to significantly compensate banks for a measure that was not even necessary in the first place. How does this make financial sense, particularly in a resource-tight situation for a potentially lengthy war against an enemy that can mutate without warning? I would rather direct those resources in the form of aid or subsidies to the rakyat and business segment that need them the most.Further, let’s assume the government decided to play the populist card, and forced such measures down the throats of our business community. How would that affect investors’ confidence in our policies for the long-term?The rule of law is necessary to build foundations and develop a stable market to enable entities to build wealth and prosper. By invoking emergency powers indiscriminately, we may be forcing parties to break or amend contracts. Dishonouring the sanctity of a contract between two parties will have serious ramifications on future business and investments.This may also have far-reaching implications which may lead to a run on our capital markets, and cause an outflow of funds which could, in turn, affect the ringgit’s value and increase the cost of doing business, collectively causing grave, long-term repercussions to our economy. We already have a public health and economic crisis to manage; why throw a potential financial and banking crisis into the mix?Is it neither fair nor responsible for the government to take all these risks just for the sake of enabling a blanket moratorium for everyone, particularly when we know that at least 80% of borrowers do not need it, and banks are already giving or offering targeted assistance to borrowers that really require this relief.Who really owns the banks? Let’s not (unknowingly) cut off our nose to spite our faceThe government, through Bank Negara, regulates and supervises banks in Malaysia under the CBA and FSA, both of which were enacted to promote stability in the financial sector, the lifeblood of any economy. The claim that Bank Negara or the government can instruct a bank to approve or reject a loan application, or restructure borrowings, runs counter to the very spirit and rationale of CBA and FSA’s existence.There is also a fact not commonly known: Who really owns the banks? Investors, yes. But who exactly are they? The largest shareholders of banks in Malaysia are institutions like EPF, PNB, KWAP, Socso, Lembaga Tabung Haji, insurance companies and fund management companies.Let’s look at who these institutions represent. EPF manages your, my and its members’ retirement funds: members are the rakyat in employment, mandated by law to contribute to EPF for their retirement. PNB is the issuer for unit trust funds like ASB, ASM, ASW etc, which is also subscribed by the rakyat like you and me. KWAP is the civil servants’ pension fund. Socso manages a social security fund for its members, a large part of the Malaysian workforce. Tabung Haji manages savings belonging to the rakyat with hajj aspirations. Insurance companies and fund managers collect premiums or subscriptions from the rakyat and businesses, and optimise their funds by investing in, among others, banks.In 2020, in terms of dividends, EPF received around RM298 million from the RHB group, while PNB, around RM1.3bil (after reinvestments) from the Maybank group. Lower earnings from these banking groups would correspondingly result in lower dividend payments for EPF members and PNB subscribers. In short, it is the general rakyat who ‘own’ the banks, albeit by proxy via entities like EPF and PNB. Ultimately, it is the rakyat who will get lower dividends from EPF, ASB or Tabung Haji etc., if banks suffered losses through, say, a blanket moratorium.This unnecessary self-destructive, over-specified solution to the issue at hand is like cutting off our nose to spite our face.Further, in simple terms, banking is about using depositors’ funds to lend to borrowers. Who are these depositors? They are still the rakyat and businesses who keep their savings and extra funds with banks. A blanket moratorium will mean that banks will not receive loan repayments to lend to others, but must still pay the interest/profit to depositors. Bank profits are also used to build capital buffers so that they can continue lending to support the economy despite loan losses. Without these buffers, lending will be severely constrained. This disrupts the virtuous cycle and halts the ensuing economic benefit that could be created from the efficient movement of capital. By ensuring that the banking sector helps all those in need, the government and Bank Negars are not only protecting depositors, shareholders and borrowers, but also ensuring that capital in the financial market ecosystem is efficiently utilised for economic growth. This is the best win-win situation.In conclusion, the powers under the FSA and CBA must be exercised sparingly, judiciously and in a manner that is consistent with the spirit and objectives stipulated by the law, which includes protecting stakeholders, as well as safeguarding the integrity and stability of our financial system. Part of my responsibility as a Finance Minister is to avoid decision-making based on narrow short-term interests meant to serve a populist agenda, and do what is right for the rakyat, our market stability and the country’s long-term benefit."

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",10:52 AM MYT,Business,,Biden's electric vehicle plan includes battery recycling push,"NEW YORK: President Joe Biden's strategy to make the United States a powerhouse in electric vehicles will include boosting domestic recycling of batteries to reuse lithium and other metals, according to government officials.As Biden makes fighting climate change and competing with China centerpieces of his agenda, the administration is set to wrap up a 100-day review on Friday of gaps in supply chains in key areas, including electric vehicles (EV).These gaps include the minerals used in EV batteries and consumer electronics. The administration is also looking for ways to reduce metal usage in new battery chemistries.Reports from various government agencies will be submitted to the White House, a process Biden ordered in an executive order earlier this year. Parts of the reports could be released publicly as soon as next week.Democrats are pushing aggressive climate goals to have a majority of U.S.-manufactured cars be electric by 2030 and every car on the road to be electric by 2040.Securing enough cobalt, lithium and other raw materials to make EV batteries is a major obstacle, with domestic mines facing extensive regulatory hurdles and environmental opposition.Reuters reported on May 25 that Biden plans to rely on mines in ally countries to supply much of the metals needed to build EVs.The administration's options to spur domestic recycling include direct investment in projects and scientific research, as well as spending funds approved by Congress.Boosting domestic recycling would help the administration further that goal by breaking down older EVs into component parts for new vehicles and thus relying less on mining.""When you look at the way the U.S. has approached the recycling opportunity, what's very evident is we need to invest in that capacity, we need to take a more proactive approach,"" said one of the administration officials.""A big part of the lithium opportunity is really recycling, and being a global leader in recycling the lithium from existing batteries and driving that into these new batteries.""The White House would like to see more recycling plants open in the United States, one of the officials said, noting the announcement last fall by China's Ganfeng Lithium Co of plans to build a battery recycling plant in Mexico to supply the U.S. EV market.EMPHASIS ON R&DThe administration's emerging strategy will also include a heavy emphasis on research and development intended to boost the use of already-mined metals, the officials said.That plan would effectively expand on ongoing research at the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory, which has been the focal point for much of the government's battery recycling research.Extracting the various mineral components of a battery has proven difficult and costly in the past, and new research focuses on ways to reuse cathodes and other battery parts, according to Argonne researchers.Washington's recycling focus comes as other regions are doing the same. The European Union is considering clamping down on exports of metal waste to encourage more regional recycling, part of an effort to become climate neutral by 2050.Global EV sales topped 2.5 million last year, a figure that's projected to jump 70 percent for 2021 and continue to rise through 2040, according to IHS Markit forecasts.Without recycling, the EV revolution would cause 8 million tons of battery scrap to be dumped in U.S. landfills alone by 2040, according to U.S. government estimates.An April report found that recycling end-of-life batteries could cut the projected need for new sources of copper for EV batteries via mining by 55% by 2040. For lithium, the figure is 25%, and for cobalt and nickel it's 35%.Recycling will have the added benefit of cutting the demand for new mines, said the report, which was authored by the conservation group Earthworks and the University of Technology Sydney's Institute for Sustainable Futures.That would help Biden avoid some battles with environmentalists and other constituencies opposed to mining.""We can power the renewable energy transition without digging new holes in the ground,"" said Payal Sampat of Earthworks.Lead acid batteries were once rarely recycled, but now nearly all are broken down for reuse in internal combustion engines. Environmentalists say that could be a blueprint for the EV recycling industry.Battery recycling plants have started to slowly open up in the United States.Last fall, Amazon.com Inc invested in Redwood Materials, a Nevada-based privately held recycling firm that has signed a deal to recycle scrap and battery parts from a Tennessee-based contractor for Nissan Motor Co's Leaf electric vehicle.Tesla Inc has said it is developing a battery recycling system at its Nevada Gigafactory. The company also contracts with third-party recyclers.And Apple Inc has started to recycle old iPhones and other electronics at a facility in Austin, Texas.The U.S. government is also the largest shareholder in mining investment firm TechMet, which is a major investor in Canadian battery recycler Li-Cycle Corp.Li-Cycle Corp plans to go public later this year through a merger with blank-check acquisition company Peridot Acquisition Corp, shares of which gained 6% on Friday.- Reuters"
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,,Most entrepreneurs at risk if MCO continues,"MORE than 90% of micro, small, medium and informal enterprises would be risking business closure if the movement control order (MCO) continues to be implemented, says the Ministry of Entrepreneur Development and Cooperative (MEDAC).As such, its minister Datuk Seri Dr Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar says the ministry will continue to undertake intervention measures under the Entrepreneur and Cooperative Recovery Plan, and offer financing assistance and targeted moratorium to help the entrepreneurs in facing the impact from the MCO.Earlier, the government had allocated RM340bil under various economic stimulus packages to help cushion the impact from MCO.Meanwhile, Wan Junaidi says the findings of two online survey conducted in March 2021 were very worrying.“Fifty-four per cent of the 3,855 respondents, especially the micro-enterprises, stated that they can only survive for three to six months.“Meanwhile, 72% of the entrepreneurs expected that businesses would continue to suffer losses, ” he told an online media conference on the findings from the ‘Impact of the Implementation of MCO on Entrepreneurs in Malaysia’ research report.The minister says that the current situation may contribute to loss of employment for more than three million Malaysians.“Micro and informal enterprises are the worst affected as their products and services are in the non-essential sectors and they do not have solid savings and cash flow.“As such, it is important to ensure that the appropriate type of assistance is given to help micro and informal entrepreneurs, and the Pemerkasa Plus initiative is expected to be able to support the resilience of this group during the lockdown, ” he adds.Wan Junaidi says a survey conducted by MEDAC involving 2,888 consumers found that the MCO has a negative impact on the people’s lives.“The B40 group are more financially impacted, while the M40 and T20 groups were more impacted by social issues, ” he says. The survey also reveals that private sector workers face a higher risk of being retrenched, the minister says.“Additionally, more than 50% of the B40 group and almost 50% of the M40 group have faced income reductions of between 10% and 30%, while 30% of the T20 group saw their incomes reduced by more than 50% due to the implementation of the MCO, ” he says. — Bernama"
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,GURMEET KAUR,Johan gets going with glove venture,"WHILE there is scepticism over the viability of new players entering rubber glove manufacturing, Johan Holdings Bhd reckons it has a strategy to make a success out of the business.This includes, among others, building a new state-of-the-art facility that complies with all environment, social and governance (ESG) issues and using the latest technology which not only reduces the labour headcount but also enables it to achieve economies of scale to reduce production costs.That, in turn, will help it fight the competition that is growing, considering the huge number of new entrants into the rubber glove industry.On Monday, Johan shareholders voted in favour of the company’s proposal to venture into the manufacture, sale and distribution of gloves. That entails spending some RM27.3mil for a piece of land in Lumut, Perak, to put up the plant. Approval was also secured for a rights issue to fund the construction of the plant, which is estimated at a whopping RM624mil.The rights issue, priced at 10 sen a share and on the basis of one rights share for every two Johan shares held, will raise some RM38.9mil. The rights also come with a free warrant for every one rights share subscribed.One interesting aspect of the new glove venture is that it will entail the participation of sister company George Kent (M) Bhd, which will invest RM40mil for a 40% stake in Dynacare Sdn Bhd, the wholly owned subsidiary of Johan that is embarking on the glove venture.George Kent will also construct the plant on a design-and-build contract from Dynacare.Johan will also use some of its own money as well as new borrowings to finance the building of the rubber glove plant.Seasoned businessman Tan Sri Tan Kay Hock is the controlling shareholder of both companies.Tan points out that George Kent is a well-established engineering construction company, having recently completed the Ampang Line Extension LRT2 and is executing with a partner the RM11.5bil LRT3.“George Kent will be holding its EGM on June 8 and if approved, the glove venture will have the joint financial resources of both Johan and George Kent, ” Tan says.While George Kent is a profitable entity, whose business entails water metering and an engineering segment that offers construction and infrastructure services, Johan has been loss-making for some time. It is disposing of its core Diners Club business to a party in Singapore. However, it should be noted that the disposal will not bring any fresh cash into Johan, as the proceeds are being used to net off receivables owned by Johan to the Diners Club businesses being sold.It is understood that with the shareholder approval for the new glove venture, Johan can proceed to dispose of its Diners Club and embark on the new venture without having to fall into the status of becoming a cash shell without any core business. Based on its latest quarterly report, Johan had RM93mil in cash and loans and borrowings of RM80mil.Johan’s share price has been hovering around 14 sen a piece for the last two months.It is left to be seen if investors get excited about the new venture that Johan is embarking on and be willing to participate in the rights issue.However, Tan points out that 99.9% votes were secured at the recent Johan EGM. “It is heartening to receive such overwhelming support for the rights issue and for the glove venture. I am putting my money where my mouth is by undertaking to subscribe fully for all my shareholding totalling 60.67%. The rest of the rights issue has been underwritten by a premier institution, ” explains Tan.Tan, who had earlier told StarBizWeek that Johan’s glove venture had come about after studying over 100 different investment proposals for the company, says the venture will be “very interesting” for the shareholders of the company.“Johan has conducted its feasibility study and sensitivity analysis. We have taken into account all possible scenarios of the market. It shows that even if the ASPs (average selling prices) of rubber gloves go back to the pre-pandemic levels, Johan’s glove venture will still be viable, ” Tan says.Phoon Hee Yau, who heads the operations for Dynacare, adds that “on a best estimate, Johan expects to achieve payback on the investment incurred within 25 months from the commencement of commercial production”.To recap, Dynacare’s plan is to build 42 automated production lines with double-former-dipping machines to manufacture examination and surgical gloves, targeting to produce 12 billion pieces of gloves per year.The commercial rollout of its first glove production line is targeted for August 2021, while it would take until mid-2023 for all 42 production lines to be commissioned as planned.“This will place Johan in the top 10 ranking by production capacity among the gloves manufacturer, ” says Phoon.Phoon adds that being a new player in the scene, “Dynacare will have the advantage of incorporating the latest and best available technology which will provide us with the highest efficiency, productivity and meeting the highest quality product in the industry”.It’s ESG focus will be an advantage, he says.“As this is a greenfield development, Dynacare is able to institutionalise industry-leading ESG standards from inception, ” he points out.This includes using solar energy with natural lighting and ventilation and advanced water treatment and recycling systems.“Located within our compound is a modern centralised living quarters, thoughtfully designed with en suite bathrooms and lockers, comfortable and safe bedrooms as well as recreational facilities and amenities for our workers’ rest and relaxation.“We have designed our building to comply with not just local regulations but also the International Labour Organisation’s recommended specifications, ” says Phoon.Adds Tan: “The board of directors of Johan believe in the long-term viability of the business, hence the plan to establish 42 lines from the get-go. This plan enables Dynacare to reap valuable economies of scale, ensuring that with each additional line installed, per unit costs will reduce. The lower cost structure helps in ensuring the viability of the project even at pre-Covid ASPs.”Tan points out that on an annualised basis, the sales from the 12 billion pieces of gloves will translate into a revenue of more than RM2bil for Dynacare.“In my 40 year business career, I have not come across a project which has buyers knocking on our doors even before we start production. This is all very exciting, ” he says.It should be noted though that glove companies currently trade at single-digit price-earnings ratios. But the reason for that is because the glove companies are reporting super normal profits, thanks to the surge in demand at the height of the pandemic. The market does not think that such profits will continue, going forward.Still, in Johan’s case, it is starting the business from scratch and if successful, a new valuation could be attached to the company, based on the profits it will be able to generate from it.Says Tan: “This project is very exciting for me personally and should be for shareholders because we are starting from a loss position. Thus any earnings for Johan Holdings, even if it is one ringgit, will enhance the performance of the company”."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,,"Short Position - Ucrest and Sputnik, Lockdown","Ucrest and SputnikOF all the locally-listed firms getting involved in the Covid-19 vaccine, Ucrest Bhd’s efforts do stand out.This company, with a market capitalisation of RM236mil and a patchy profit track record, has inked a deal to manage the contract manufacturing for the Sputnik V vaccine.On April 9, Ucrest said it had inked an MoU with Russian Direct Investment Fund or RDIF to manage contract manufacturing in Asia for the latter, in order to produce Sputnik V. RFID is a government entity responsible for the commercialisation of Sputnik V. However, what Ucrest has not revealed is the reason why RFID has handpicked Ucrest for this role.After all, Ucrest is not a manufacturer of any drugs let alone vaccines, so one wonders what skill sets it has in order to be able to play the role of identifying and managing contract manufacturers for a vaccine.In reply to a further query from Bursa Malaysia as to how Ucrest would derive revenue from the arrangement, Ucrest says that RDIF will purchase the vaccines from UCrest and UCrest will be outsourcing the production to manufacturing partners. If this materialises it would be a sweet deal for Ucrest, although again, one wonders what is Ucrest’s strength to be able to be given such a sweet role.To be fair, Ucrest is involved in the medical sector but that is as a technology provider. It’s i-Medic cloud services enable users to store their medical records safely and share them securely with healthcare professionals and is used by doctors and patients in various countries, including Russia.What has excited investors chasing up Ucrest shares is the fact that the company now says it has inked agreements with two China based contract manufacturers to produce massive amounts of the Sputnik vaccine.In fact, Ucrest points out that RFID will purchase from Ucrest not less than 100 million doses and not more than one billion doses of the vaccine per annum for the first two years. For perspective, the only Malaysian company allowed to bring in the Sputnik vaccine into the country is Duopharma Biotech Bhd which just signed an agreement with the government to supply 6.4 million doses of the vaccine to Malaysia.Whatever the case, the deal between Ucrest and RFID is merely at an MoU level at this point.All eyes should be on the detailed and definite agreement between the two parties. Hopefully that will come out soon.It rests with usAS Malaysians get accustomed to yet another lockdown, the immediate intent of it is to reduce the spread of the virus among the people.With daily rates hitting numbers unexpected some months ago, the tough decision of ensures lives are protected was made with keeping the essential elements of the economy chugging along.The consequence of the lockdown has another fold which is economically.With a large part of businesses shut, the intended pop in economic growth in the second quarter will be muted than what was earlier projected.The result is that economic growth for the full year will come in lower than the official projection of between 6% and 7.5% for 2021.The other unfortunate impact will be on employment with the slow drop in unemployment might reverse if Malaysia does not reel in the spread of the virus fast enough.The mutations of the virus and its ease of transmissibility is a fight like never before but examples from countries that are containing and reducing the overall spread of the virus teaches us one important lesson.it is apparent that the best deterrent against future economic calamities from the virus is for people to get their jabs as fast as possible.With the pace of supply scheduled to rise, the high number of cases is also injected some urgency in the number of people willing to get the vaccine.With 12.6 million Malaysians indicated their intent to get the vaccine, the increase in the speed of vaccination will mean curtailing the future economic impact from the virus.That will mean that businesses will be allowed to operate more and more like normal, and that is important for an economy that is dependent on domestic demand.Our exports continue to do well with the electrical and electronic sector, along with commodities such as oil and gas, and palm oil enjoying high prices.But its is allowing daily lives to return to normal that will be the real fifth gear for the economy.There is so much savings and pent-up demand that only a significant drop in the daily case number will encourage more optimism among the public.With job security that a stable economy offers, then expect a revision to higher growth rates.But that can only start with us Malaysians. Following the SOP and getting vaccinated is the sure-fire way of a return to normalcy and job security that all of us crave after a lengthy period that has been wrecked by the pandemic."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,INTAN FARHANA ZAINUL,Sweeter outlook on the cards for for MSM Holdings,"OVER the last few years, MSM Malaysia Holdings Bhd has faced issues of overcapacity due to a supply glut in the local sugar market as well as governance issues.The company reported losses for two consecutive years of 2019 and 2020, which in turn dented its share price performance.Prior to that, MSM was liked by some investors as it was the country’s largest refined sugar producer.MSM’s stock had traded above RM5 in large 2016 but since then, it has been on a declining trend, hitting a low as 28 sen in March 2020. It closed at RM1.31 yesterday.In 2019, it had attracted many suitors when its major shareholder FGV Holdings Bhd said it was planning to sell its 51% stake in the company.Interested parties were said include Singapore-based agribusiness firm Wilmar International Ltd and former Second Finance Minister Datuk Seri Johari Abdul Ghani.Their interest in MSM lies in the latter’s underutilised sugar refining capacity of 2.25 million tonnes per year.Its Johor refinery that has a 1.2 million tonne capacity has faced issues of underutilisation and breakdowns.In April, MSM announced a temporary production shutdown at the refinery for due to a boiler breakdown.The plant resumed its operations yesterday.MSM chief executive officer Syed Feizal Syed Mohammad expects the Johor plant to achieve a 50% utilisation rate by next month from 22% in the first quarter of this year.He adds that a 50% utilisation rate is the breakeven level for the plant in Johor.Syed Feizal reckons that the group is on track for a turnaround this year.Over the last two quarters, MSM has been reporting profits thanks to higher exports sales, better margins, higher utilisation rates and collaboration with global brands.“We are poised to return as a dividend-paying stock and create greater shareholder value moving forward, ” he tells StarBizWeek.Syed Feizal was appointed as an interim CEO of MSM last October after the departure of the company’s former CEO Datuk Khairil Anuar Aziz, who was asked to leave after MSM’s board found his clarification about an adjustment to write off inventories that amounted to RM36.6mil unacceptable.Syed Feizal was appointed as the CEO of MSM effective February this year.He expects MSM to sustain its quarterly profits driven by improvements in its Johor operations, the introduction of new products, and lower operating expenses.“We are re-balancing the domestic market by taking advantage of MSM Prai and MSM Johor locations in reducing selling and distribution costs, ” he says.“The local market volume has been stable even during the pandemic period. While there is some growing demand for less sugar, the overall market demand for sugar remains high with population increase year-on-year and per capita consumption patterns recorded.“Our growth in the export segment and enhanced market position on the domestic front provides a strong impetus for MSM to achieve sustainable growth ahead.”In addition, the group had also diversified into downstream sugar products such as liquid sugar and syrup that could garner higher margins.“We expect the Johor refinery to reach a utilisation rate of 50% by Q3.“In addition, we have upgraded the capacity for value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix with an annual production capacity of 140,000 metric tonnes per year, ” Syed Feizal says.He says the new products are mainly for the export market with an approximate revenue contribution of RM260mil a year.At the moment, MSM exports 30% of its production volume and it is planning to grow it to 50% in the medium to long term.Syed Fiezal says that MSM’s exports market growth would be driven by its collaborations with major industry players including Wilmar, Maxwill, Coca-Cola and Pepsi.“Our aim is to strengthen our regional presence through the export of sugar and value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix, ” he says.For FY2020, MSM exported 270,628 tonnes of sugar products with a sales revenue of RM467mil as compared to 83,341 tonnes and RM173mil sales recorded in FY2019.For this year, MSM is targeting to increase the export volume to 330,000 tonnes with an estimated revenue contribution of RM600mil.“In 2019, MSM started to export value-added products such as liquid sugar, fine syrup and premix.“We are certainly targeting to increase the export of these value-added products moving forward which are in very high demand, ” Syed Fiezal says.MIDF Research expects MSM’s financial performance to improve gradually this year on the back of improved production costs, higher volume, and a higher premium.“we maintain our sanguine outlook on the group as MSM is currently in the midst of improving its utilisation rate of Johor refinery to more than 50% this year, ” it says in a recent report.The research house expects demand from the export segment to remain upbeat but the group’s overall revenue could be impacted by the underperformance from the wholesale segment.The outlook for MSM seems to look sweeter than before, especially with its expanding exports market that could address the group’s overcapacity issues that have been dragging its profitability since 2018.But the issues with its plant operation in Johor could be something to watch for as there are still hiccups in its operation."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,,Downside risk in banks rising amid uncertainties,"KUALA LUMPUR: The banking industry’s profitability recovered in Q1 of 2021 after last year’s slump but RAM Ratings expressed concern about the highly uncertain operating environment and the impact on the industry’s profit outlook.The rating agency said in a statement yesterday the top five largest banking groups reported a year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in profit before tax ranging from 13% to 114%, after adjusting for one-off items.“The improvement was underpinned by a strong rebound in net interest margins (NIMs) amid lower funding costs, and to a lesser extent, lower impairment charges.“That said, the highly uncertain operating environment – as reflected by the recent imposition of a lockdown – continues to cast a shadow over the industry’s profit outlook, ” it said.RAM cited an extension of the two-week lockdown – currently from June 1 to 14 - and slower-than-expected rollout of the national vaccination programme for the Covid-19 will heighten downside risks through heftier provisioning needs and weaker credit demand.RAM’s co-head of financial institution ratings Wong Yin Ching said: “The average net interest margin (NIM) of our eight selected local banking groups rebounded 14 bps y-o-y to an annualised 2.31% in Q1 2021.“This was driven by the gradual repricing of fixed deposits amid the aggregate 125 bps cut in the overnight policy rate (OPR) last year and rising proportions of low-cost current and savings account deposits.“Barring further OPR cuts, their NIM for the full year should be 15-20 bps higher than 2020’s given reduced funding costs and the absence of sizeable modification losses (incurred in Q2 of 2020), ” she said in the report, in conjunction with the publication of the rating agency’s Banking Quarterly Roundup Q1 2021.In March 2021, the banking sector’s loan growth picked up to 3.9% (December 2020: 3.4%), fuelled by resilient household lending even though business loan growth remained anaemic.“Full-year credit expansion is projected to moderate to about 3%. The less optimistic forecast is premised on the prevailing uncertainties and still challenging climate, ” RAM said.While the extension of the Home Ownership Campaign and vehicle sales tax waiver until end-2021 will support credit demand, borrowers’ cautious appetite may restrict big-ticket expenditure.Masked by ongoing loan relief measures, the system’s gross impaired loan ratio kept stable at 1.58% as at end-March 2021 (end-December 2020: 1.56%).Loan repayment assistance as well as restructuring and rescheduling (R&R) are still readily available for all troubled borrowers.As part of the recently announced Pemerkasa Plus stimulus package, the government has also reintroduced the automatic approval for applications from those who have lost their jobs, B40 individuals and affected SMEs to obtain a three-month payment holiday or 50% reduced instalments for six months.“Based on the latest available data, about 13% of the eight selected local banks’ domestic loan portfolios were under relief or R&R.“We expect the proportion to trend upwards given the tighter movement restrictions’ likely adverse impact on businesses and employment. The underlying asset quality will become clearer once forbearance measures are lifted, with impaired loans likely to only peak in 2022, ” it said."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,,Takeover offer below fair value,"KUALA LUMPUR: The independent directors of Can-One Bhd have advised minority shareholders to reject the takeover offer of RM2.50 a share as it is sharply below the fair value of RM9.77 a share.In the circular to minority shareholders yesterday, the independent directors concurred with independent adviser Public Investment Bank that the takeover offer is “not fair” and “not reasonable” and recommended they “reject” the offer.In the executive summary, the board said the estimated fair value of Can-One is RM1.87bil or RM9.77 per Can-One share.“The offer price of RM2.50 per Can-One share is lower than the estimated fair value of Can-One share which represent a discount of RM7.27 or 74.41% over the estimated fair value per Can-One share, ” it said.The independent board said based on the assessment of the offer price “we are of the opinion that the offer is not fair”.As for the reasonableness of the offer, it said although the Can-One shares are relatively illiquid, the offer price of RM2.50 is a discount ranging from 13.10% to 20.26% over the last traded price of Can-One shares as at the last trading date (LTD) at May 3, and the five-day, one-month, three-month, six-month and one-year volume weighted average market price (VWAMP) of Can-One shares up to the LTD.It said as the offeror intends to maintain the listing status, the holders will still be able to participate in the trading of Can-One Shares after the closing date.On May 4, Can-One received an unconditional mandatory takeover offer at RM2.50 per share from its director Yeoh Jin Hoe (pic, above) and persons acting in concert with him (PACs).Eller Axis Sdn Bhd had entered into an unconditional share sale agreement with Genkho Candoz Sdn Bhd to buy a 20.94% stake in Can-One for RM100.6mil or RM2.50 per Can-One share.Can-One is involved in the manufacture of metal and lithographed cans, plastic jerry cans, bag-in-boxes, and the manufacture, packaging and distribution of dairy and non-dairy products.Before the deal, Yeoh who owns 95% of Eller Axis had a 3.91% stake in Can-One, while Eller Axis owns 23.73% and the PACs held another 11.99%.After the deal, Yeoh, Eller Axis and the PACs will see their collective stakes in Can-One rising from 39.63% to 60.57%, and as such, they were obliged to extend an unconditional mandatory take-over offer to acquire all the remaining Can-One Shares which are not already held by them."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,EUGENE MAHALINGAM,Renting in a pandemic,"FOR Azman, March 16,2020 will always be an unforgettable date for the 32-year old IT supervisor.Yes, it was the day when Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced that the entire country would go into a nationwide lockdown two days later.But it was also the day that Azman finally received the keys to an apartment from an expatriate couple who were leaving the country for good.It was the first property Azman would own legally and he wanted to start earning rental income as soon as possible.Unfortunately, with the movement control order (MCO) imposed just two days later, Azman’s aspirations of becoming a landlord were dashed.Fortunately, when the number of daily infections started to subside significantly in June 2020 and the government announced the recovery MCO period, things started to pick up again.Azman found a tenant, but that did not last.When Covid-19 cases started escalating again towards the end of last year, Azman’s tenant lost his job and had no choice but to vacate the premises.The uncertainty in the property market caused by the high number of daily Covid-19 infections has created a lot of problems for potential landlords like Azman.It also does not help that at least six of Azman’s neighbours have also let out their units with the intention of earning rental income.“Given the current situation, it’s a bit of a challenge when it comes to securing a tenant, ” Azman says.“Everyone’s either slashing rents or throwing in some kind of incentives, so the competition is fierce, ” he adds.Savills Malaysia Sdn Bhd group managing director Datuk Paul Khong says the demand for residential properties, especially from a rental perspective, increases during times of uncertainty such as when a country goes into total lockdown.“However, it is not easy to increase rentals in a pandemic but it makes sense to improve the rentability of the unit, ” he tells StarBizWeek.“Look at furnishing up the unit tastefully with nice furniture and fittings, plus a new air conditioner or even WiFi. It would be quite attractive and ideal but this option is only good if the tenant is willing to pay.For basic units, a fresh coat of paint and a clean unit at an affordable price is usually sufficient to attract tenants, adds Khong.“Get more renters into a single unit and the aggregate rents can then be relatively higher.”Additionally, Khong says one could try to speed up the take-up rate by offering discounted rentals upfront, followed by normalised rates after three-to-six months.“Flexible or no deposit payments can also be an attraction but must be compensated with slightly higher rentals.”Khong adds that a unit that has been empty for three-to-six months equals to between 25% and 50% discount on total rents receivable over a one-year period.“In other words, rent slightly lower but keep the unit tenanted all year round, as the impact will be the same, ” he says.Meanwhile, Greenhill & Mason Sdn Bhd business development head Ruben Kelvin says being able to save costs as much as possible, especially during the pandemic, is an added bonus.“If you’re replacing or reinstalling new air conditioners, inverters would consume less electricity. Having LED light fittings or bulbs also will help keep the bills down, so go with energy saving fittings.“This will be an added advantage to the tenant that’s looking for the best bang for his or her buck.”Ruben also advises landlords to service and repair their electrical appliances and fittings regularly, while also keeping a log on the services or repairs made.“It would be best for an owner to service everything before handover to the tenant, so that there will be less disputes.”He adds that this also helps set a precedent that it is also the tenant’s responsibility to keep things in good working condition.“This will not only help attract responsible tenants, but also reduce the repair costs in the long run.”With the pandemic forcing more people to work from home, Ruben says it is imperative to ensure that there are ethernet points in most rooms if the property is large.“Remember to properly position your fiber optic cables for the placement of the modem and router, preferably in the centre of the property so that the signal range covers most of the unit.”If renovations are necessary, Ruben advises that they be done wisely.“Prioritise your kitchen and bathroom as they are the ‘workhorses’ of your property. For bathrooms, it would be good to have a shower pump with good water pleasure. A noiseless pump would cost more, but they would be an added bonus.“For the kitchen, try to have at least a fridge, stove, and ample storage space.”For the kitchen cabinets, Ruben believes that it would be best to spend more on longer lasting materials, such as high density plywood and quartz tops to reduce repairs.“Have ample plug points near countertops for appliances such as blenders, toasters and microwaves.”Ruben also agrees that a fresh coat of paint will always uplift the look of a property.“Plan the colour of certain walls, so that they accentuate the different focal points of the interior.“Using neutral or pastel colours for your walls also allows easy matching for furniture and fittings.”Given the uncertainty caused by the current pandemic, it makes sense to hold on to your hard-earned money for a rainy day, or at least until things pick up.But what about the landlord that’s looking to rent out his unit and start earning rental income?If there are upgrades and renovations to be done, can they wait?Khong says all repairs or improvements should be done immediately.“With the full lockdown enforced, renters will need to spend a significant amount of time at home. If their place is tacky and uncomfortable, they will really appreciate a better place to stay, especially now.“Many renters wouldn’t mind paying a little more to have a better and bigger place with some common facilities and extra space to move around. Others, however, may still want cheaper rents as they struggle through the pandemic, especially if they are unemployed.”Ruben says a landlord should weigh his options before making a decision.“If you have the means to improve your property during the pandemic, it would be advisable as when the market improves, you would want your property to be available in good, working condition to be rented out.“Should you have less of a budget, prioritise functionality over aesthetics, ” he says."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,THOMAS HUONG,Banking on renewable energy demand,"PEKAT Group Bhd is optimistic about its steady business growth prospects, due to growing demand for renewable energy (RE) from solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and the impact of global warming on lightning activities.Founded in 1999, Pekat has three business divisions namely the design, supply and installation of solar PV systems and power plants, and the supply and installation of earthing and lightning protection (ELP) systems, as well as trading which involves the distribution of electrical products and accessories..The group is enroute to a ACE Market listing on June 23,2021.Pekat managing director and co-founder Chin Soo Mau says the group needs to tap into the equity capital market to raise funds to expand its solar PV and ELP businesses.The group’s IPO (initial public offering) prospectus noted that it had expanded into the solar PV industry in December 2010, when Pekat was awarded its first contract to design, supply and install an on-grid solar PV system at Kuala Lumpur Sentral Lot E (now known as Platinum Sentral) with an installed capacity of 168 kilowatts-peak (kWp).“There are many buildings and plants without solar PV systems. More companies are demanding RE, ” Chin told StarBizWeek.As an example, Chin cited a 12.1 mega watt peak (MWp) solar PV power plant which the group had completed this month at Proton’s manufacturing facility in Tanjung Malim, Perak for RM33mil.The deal involves a power purchase agreement (PPA) where Pekat’s 45% owned associate MFP Solar Sdn Bhd (the balance 55% is owned by Mega First C&I Solar Sdn Bhd) will supply power to Proton at rates stipulated in the PPA for 15 years. Regarding the demand for ELP systems, Chin pointed out that in 2016, it was reported that Malaysia has the third highest lightning activity in the world (after Indonesia and Colombia) – according to the United States National Lightning Safety Institute.He also cited a 2014 report in the journal Science, where University of California, Berkeley scientists found a 12% rise in lightning strikes per degree Celsius of warming.Chin says that the Energy Commission Malaysia made lightning protection systems mandatory for buildings.As a Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) G7 license contractor, Pekat provides ELP solutions according to customers’ requirements for commercial buildings, mixed developments, infrastructure and industrial buildings.Among the notable projects for ELP systems are the Prime Minister’s Residence in Putrajaya, Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) 1 Sungai Buloh and Kajang maintenance depots and administration buildings, substations and other buildings at the Pengerang Integrated Complex (Johor) and Warisan Merdeka Tower (now known as Merdeka 118 Tower).Regarding its competitive strengths, Chin pointed out that Pekat has experienced management and technical teams, and a trading division that provides synergistic benefits as the solar and ELP divisions use some of the electrical products and accessories for their projects.Besides its own brands, the group is also an authorised distributor for five third-party brands of electrical products and accessories namely Furse, FurseWeld, Noark, Solar-Log and Sungrow.Double-digit revenue increase expectedFor Pekat’s financial year ending Dec 31,2021 (FY21), Chin is expecting a double-digit growth in revenue, based on its order book and projects secured.Chin pointed out that Pekat has a healthy RM198.9mil order book as at May 3,2021, of which RM44mil has been billed and the balance RM154.9mil is unbilled.Purchase orders for its trading division is RM12.4mil. Out of the group’s unbilled order book, about RM117mil will be recognised in 2021 while the balance will be recognised over the next few years.Chin also says the group hopes to benefit from infrastructure works for mega projects such as the Johor Bahru – Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) link and East Coast Rail Link (ECRL). As for the current price hike in solar PV materials, Chin opined that it would be short-term. “It may take up to 18 months, but eventually, prices will drop. Solar PV systems are still much cheaper today as their prices are about 10% to 15% of the prices 10 years ago. This is despite prices going up by 10 to 20% in the last few months, ” he said.Chin says the trend of solar PV systems becoming more cost-effective and efficient will continue due to economies of scale, market competition and improving technology.The group does not have a dividend policy.“We are focusing on business growth. We hope to reward shareholders when we grow to a certain level, ” said Chin, adding that Pekat saw a four-year revenue compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.9% from FY17 to FY20.IPO to accelerate business growthFor FY20, the solar division contributed 54.6% (or RM20.8mil) of its RM38.1mil gross profit, followed by the ELP (24%) and trading (21.4%) divisions.As for FY20’s RM125.6mil revenue, the solar division contributed 57.4% (or RM72.1mil), followed by the trading (21.6%) and ELP (21%) divisions.For FY20, group revenue rose 5% year-on-year while profit after tax dropped 8.6% to RM13.6mil, mainly due to higher cost of sales.Pekat says the cost of sales had jumped 19.6% year-on-year to RM87.4mil, mainly due to higher purchases of solar PV modules to support an increase in projects and higher subcontractor costs.The higher revenue in FY20 was mainly due to its solar division revenue’s 23% jump year-on-year to RM72.1mil which cushioned a 13.1% and 10.6% drop in the ELP and trading divisions’ revenue respectively, as a result of lower sales of ELP and solar PV related products.As for the impact of movement restrictions, Pekat said from March 18,2020 till May 3,2021, it did not receive any cancellation or suspension of contracts or purchase orders.Based on the IPO price of 32 sen and FY20’s diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 2.1 sen, the price-earnings ratio (PER) is 15.2 times.Post listing, the group’s gearing ratio will drop from 0.43 to 0.17 times. The group expects to raise RM44.4mil from the listing, of which RM18mil (40.6%) will be used to build a new head office and operational facilities in City of Elmina, Sungai Buloh.The new head office with a built-up area of 114,252 sq ft is due to be completed by December 2023, and will be an integrated facility (showcase area, central monitoring station, training centre, workshop and warehouse).“We are outgrowing our current head office in Kota Damansara. The new place will help us to save about RM1mil in rental costs a year, ” said Chin.The group’s prospectus had noted that employees at the current head office had nearly doubled from 61 to 119 personnel in the last four years. The group’s promoters and shareholders are Chin (47%), Pekat executive directors Tai Yee Chee (15.1%) and Wee Chek Aik (12.9%) and Hextar Holdings Sdn Bhd (25%) which is a major shareholder of Main Market listed Hextar Global Bhd.Upon listing, the promoters and Hextar Holdings will hold in aggregate 73.5% of the enlarged issued share capital of 645 million shares. Pekat is issuing 138.7 million new shares representing 21.5% of the enlarged share capital, of which 32.2 million is for the Malaysian public via balloting; 16.1 million for eligible directors, employees and persons who have contributed to the success of Pekat; and 90.3 million will be placed out to selected Bumiputera investors approved by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and selected investors.Existing shareholders will also offer 32.2 million shares to selected investors via private placement.The IPO is open for subscription till June 10. 2021."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,,A ‘tsunami’ of cash is driving rates ever lower. What will the Fed do?,"BANKS have too much cash on their hands – and they’re running out of places to put it.Nowhere is this more evident than in the rising popularity of a Federal Reserve programme that lets firms stash their cash overnight with the US central bank in exchange for at best a small return. The payout these days: Zero percent.But usage is soaring to record highs as money market funds and other eligible firms cope with what some analysts are calling a “tsunami” of cash.The banking system is swimming in nearly US$4 trillion (RM16.51 trillion) of reserves, thanks in part to the Fed’s asset purchases, a fall off in Treasury bill issuance and a rapid drawdown in the government’s store of funds at the Fed. The Treasury General Account, or TGA, has dropped by nearly US$1 trillion (RM4.13 trillion) since last fall, mirrored by the surge in bank reserves.All that cash is pushing down short-term rates and increasing expectations the Fed will need to respond with a technical adjustment at its June 15-16 meeting, if not earlier, in order to keep its key policy rate from sliding further.The situation is also a headache for money market funds, which are absorbing much of the money and finding fewer options for investing it, a dynamic the Fed is watching closely.“They’re getting cash in the door and aren’t able to find good places to invest it, ” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a senior US rates strategist for TD Securities.Time to act?Fed policymakers were briefed by staff on money market issues at their last meeting in April. A senior official from the New York Fed advised them they may want to consider making a minor technical adjustment to rates “in the coming months” if the downward pressure on overnight rates continued.The effective federal funds rate – the central bank’s critical policy rate – slipped as low as 0.05% at the end of May before rising back to 0.06%. It is hovering near the bottom of the Fed’s target range of zero to 0.25%. The lowest it has ever settled on a daily basis is 0.04%.The central bank’s options for responding include lifting the interest it pays on excess reserves, or IOER, which is currently at 0.10% and is available only to banks. It could also lift the rate on the facility soaking up much of the extra cash: reverse repurchase agreements, or reverse repos, which are open to non-banks such as money-market funds.Together, the two are designed to form the “corridor” for the fed funds rate. The reverse repo rate – currently at zero – sets the floor by giving firms a risk-free place to park some of their cash overnight. Usage soared to a record US$485.3bil (RM2 trillion) last week, up from nearly nothing in March.The increased popularity of reverse repo may be a sign that the Fed has “injected too much cash into the market, ” said Scott Skyrm, executive vice-president in fixed income and repo at Curvature Securities. “It’s going straight back to the Fed.”Policymakers expanded access to the facility this year by loosening the eligibility rules and raising the daily limit on operations to US$80bil (RM330.28bil) per user from US$30bil (RM123.85bil).But some analysts say the Fed may need to do more by boosting the rate from zero, perhaps by 2-3 basis points or its more typical move of 5 basis points. Any adjustments to reverse repo or IOER could happen at the June meeting or before, analysts say.Fund squeezeMany banks, unwilling to accumulate any more deposits, are funnelling some of the excess reserves into money market funds.But with interest rates expected to stay low for the foreseeable future, money funds could struggle to find safe ways to invest that growing pile of cash to avoid losses for investors. While they can waive fees, fund providers still have overhead costs to cover.“At some point these funds are going to be pressed for profitability too, ” said Steven Kelly, a research associate with the Programme on Financial Stability at the Yale School of Management. Firms that “take money and invest it at zero percent return” may struggle to cover their expenses.Some money funds might eventually have to close to new investors or lower payouts, he said.The Fed could offer money funds some relief if it raises the rate it pays on reverse repo operations, Kelly said. But that wouldn’t address the longer-term financial stability concerns surrounding the funds, which sometimes have to sell holdings during times of stress in order to meet redemption requests, he said.The central bank and other regulators have singled out money market funds, which the Fed supported at the height of the pandemic and more than a decade earlier during the global financial crisis, as an area that is ripe for more reform.“There’s a structural issue and we know this, ” Fed chair Jerome Powell said during an interview with CBS in April. “It really is time to address it decisively.” — Reuters"

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Business,DANIEL KHOO,Automakers seen to bear the brunt of chip shortage,"THE chip shortage that is being experienced in the semiconductor sector is expected to have a more pronounced impact on the automotive sector compared with the consumer electronics industry.According to industry insiders surveyed by StarBizWeek, this is due to the lower priority that is being given by the semiconductor industry to the auto makers as volumes from this segment are much lower.The apparent worldwide shortage in semiconductor chips appears to continue to escalate. The issue appears to be sparked by fears from the spillover effects of the US-China trade war, which drove the stocking up of inventory of semiconductor chips.The initial shortage is now compounded by various factors including the increased demand that is seen due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, as people generally bought more desktops, laptops and smart devices to power their remote working and learning needs.“It appears to be a perfect storm that has hit the industry compounded by several factors, causing the shortage, ” QES Group Bhd managing director and president Chew Ne Weng (pic below) tells StarBizWeek.“Supply chains had also been affected in early 2020 when Covid-19 first broke out. This caused manufacturers to cut down their production. All the big manufacturers basically reduced it in anticipation that it would be quite bad for at least three quarters or so, ” Chew says.He says the US-China trade frictions then drove many China tech companies such as Huawei to stock up and buy up all the chips available in the market.“They bought all these chips as a risk mitigation step: to reduce supply risks. When they bought up a lot, the rest of the players had also (followed suit) and bought up a lot as well on fears that they would be the last to get (supplies). This churned up the artificial demand tremendously, ” Chew says.The ongoing shortage had recently also been compounded by natural disasters happening at around the same time in various locations that are involved in the semiconductor supply chain.It was reported in February 2021 that a winter storm had closed computer-chip manufacturing facilities in Texas, which is the heart of semiconductor manufacturing in the United States.A prolonged dry spell, which had led to a drought in Taiwan, had also affected the production for semiconductor giants such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd and Micron Technology Inc that have major chip-making operations in the affected areas.Semiconductor fabricators require a substantial amount of water for tasks such as washing the wafers and cooling processes to keep their operations running.It was reported yesterday that Taiwan had received heavy rainfall again. However, the government is still maintaining its drought alert there and is telling the public to continue conserving water.At around the same time, there had also been various fires that had broken out in various semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Japan that mostly supply to the automotive industry.“All these have compounded the shortage. In the past three months, the automotive players have been concerned as their production is impacted. Many governments would be concerned because the automotive industry has a big spillover effect on the broader economy, ” Chew says.“Manufacturing of a vehicle has got so many tier-1,2 and 3 outlying suppliers. This is very significant. If let’s say the shortage had impacted production of two million cars. You can multiply the effect of this to the supply chain, assuming one car uses 500 screws. This is lost revenue to the supply chain since they can’t make the car, ” he adds.Meanwhile, MMS Ventures Bhd CEO Sia Teik Keat tells StarBizWeek that semiconductor manufacturers usually prioritise consumer electronics companies for supplies.“For the automakers, they cannot complete the car assembly without the IC chip. Priority is usually given to the PCs, laptops and smart devices as they have much higher volumes while for automotive, the volumes are much lower, ” Sia says.Globetronics Technology Bhd CEO Datuk Heng Huck Lee says that shortages appear to only affect certain segments within the industry and not across the board.Heng says that in his capacity, he does not feel a shortage is happening on his end.Intel Corp CEO Pat Gelsinger was reported as saying earlier in the week that the global shortage of semiconductors could take several years before it is resolved.He attributed the shortage to the sudden surge in demand that has placed huge strain on global supply chains."

A weekly supply report on Thursday showed U.S. crude inventories dropped more than expected last week.Oil extended gains after U.S. figures showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 559,000 jobs last month. The U.S. dollar weakened after the report, making oil cheaper for holders of other currencies and lending support to oil prices.Brent crude rose 58 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $71.89 a barrel, after touching $72.17, its highest since May 2019.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 81 cents, or 1.2%, to settle at $69.62. The session high was $69.76, its highest since October 2018.Oil prices drifted higher after U.S. energy firms this week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating, for the first time in six weeks, data from energy services firm Baker Hughes showed.""After much dilly-dallying, Brent appears to have found a new home above $70,"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM. ""Summer and the reopening of the global economy is bullish for oil demand in the second half of the year.""Brent rose about 3% on the week while U.S. crude notched gains of nearly 5%. It is the second week of gains for both contracts.Also boosting oil this week was a slowdown in talks between the United States and Iran over Tehran's nuclear programme, which reduced expectations of a return of Iranian oil supply.""Energy markets are locked in on Iran nuclear talks that should pick up next week,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA said.""The fifth round of negotiations will heat up next week and that should keep oil prices supported as Tehran will stick to their red lines for restoring the nuclear deal.""Meanwhile, U.S. crude output is likely to grow more slowly than expected as shale producers have added only a limited number of extra rigs to boost production, opting to push for higher prices and profits instead.While rising demand and the fast pace of vaccinations in countries such as the United States have boosted oil, a slower inoculation rollout and high infections in the likes of Brazil and India are hitting demand in high-growth oil markets.""Not every country in the world is on a full recovery mode yet, but at the moment no hiccup seems able to reverse the bullish momentum ushered in by strong summer demand,"" Rystad Energy's oil markets analyst Louise Dickson said.- Reuters"

We were thinking positively because we were only 1-0 down then.“So, we thought we could get an equaliser through De Paula,” he said in a virtual media conference from Dubai.The challenge for Cheng Hoe now is to boost the players’ motivation and determination for the two remaining must-win matches. The other match is against Thailand on June 15.Meanwhile, Cheng Hoe praised the backline, especially Dion Cools (of Belgian-Malaysian parentage), who was quick to blend in despite it being his debut with the Harimau Malaya.“With his experience, having played at the highest level in Europe, he was calm and he was also tactically and technically spot-on,” he said.“His reading of the game was also good.“We hope he will be able to help raise the team’s standard and guide the younger players so that the country’s football future will be brighter.”—Bernama."

When we take on Vietnam, we will play more courageously. This is a solid team and we have what it takes to qualify for the Asian Cup and the third round qualifier,” said the KV Kortrijk striker.“When I came on as a substitute, I didn’t feel nervous because I wanted to be on the pitch and give my all. However, we faced a side that are ranked higher than us, so it was a different experience.“I hope I can have more of this experience in these qualifiers.“In terms of my own performance, it was satisfactory, but more can be done.

We just have to be prepared before the game. If given a chance, I will justify the faith.”When asked if he preferred to play alongside Syafiq Ahmad or Guilherme De Paula up front, Luqman said it was all about team effort.“We are one team.

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,Sport,,Approval for maintenance work to resume welcomed all round,"THE Malaysian Golf Association’s (MGA) announcement on Thursday that golf clubs were allowed to operate a reduced workforce for maintenance purposes was greeted with relief across the board.This follows the Ministry of Housing and Local Government’s approval of an appeal from the national association to allow course maintenance operations during the present lockdown.The MGA’s response to earlier inquiries from TeeUp as to what the MGA was doing to help alleviate the predicament of golf clubs, some of whom called for their workforce to be allowed to operate, even at 30% capacity in the face of the national lockdown, was that an appeal had been lodged with Government.Several golf clubs expressed fears that they could incur costs that amount to tens of thousands of ringgit, if not millions, following the imposition the movement control order 3.0 that came into effect on Tuesday.These untold of costs, the clubs said, would have come mainly from the deterioration of the golf courses themselves, given that work of any sort on the facilities was not permitted during this movement control order.Prior to the national lockdown on Tuesday, which has been penciled in for two weeks, a work force of up 30% of their normal capacity was allowed at clubs in the districts and states most severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. However, that restriction was revised on the grounds that golf did not fall under essential services, and thus no work operations of any sort were permitted.This prompted some clubs to call for a review of the situation, pointing out that they stood to lose massively in the wake of no work being undertaken on the courses.Saujana Golf & Country Club general manager S.A. Nathan said:“We are pleased by the approval given to conduct maintenance work again. Our authorities must know that it would have been a costly exercise to recover the course if no maintenance was carried out during this lockdown.“And that is why we urged them to allow at least 30% of the workforce for course maintenance. We will also ensure strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) are imposed during this period,” he added.An administrator with more than three decades experience in the golf industry, Nathan added: “Courses need to be maintained daily with practices as outlined in the golf course maintenance programme. This is to avoid pests and diseases attacking the grasses of the greens, tee boxes and fairways, and allow for the general upkeep of the plant life and golf course.“If this not allowed, it will become a very costly exercise to recover later,” he said.Among the key areas of maintenance of golf courses are irrigation and water management systems, fertiliser programmes, sand bunker rejuvenation and the nurturing of the greens, which by nature are a delicate proposition to handle on the best of days.Speaking TeeUp, MGA secretary, Datuk Zulkifli Ismail had earlier said: “We are aware of the pressing needs of golf clubs to continue with their maintenance works. And that is why we liaised with Ministry of Housing and Local Government to get the relevant approval for golf clubs to maintain their courses during the lockdown period.“The details requested by the ministry to facilitate thisapproval from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI) were sent along with the course maintenance standard operating procedures (SOP) prepared by the Golf Club Managers Association of Malaysia (GCMAM).“MGA is grateful for the assistance from all agencies, the National Security Council, Ministry of Housing and Local Government, as well as the industry stakeholders, golf clubs and GCMAM in compiling the data on course maintenance to facilitate the approval by MITI.”For more info on applying for the permit via CIMS at https://notification.miti.gov.my call 012-2057969."

The main goal now for this year is the world meet but we want to maintain our form until the 2024 Paris Olympics, ” said Shevon.Soon Huat-Shevon were ranked 11th in the Road to Tokyo ranking but it was not good enough to land them a debut in the Games. This is because a country can only have one pair in the top 16 unless both pairs are ranked in the top eight.Only 2016 Rio Olympic Games silver medallists Peng Soon-Liu Ying made the cut for Tokyo by virtue of being ranked seventh.Though disappointed, Shevon is certainly not disheartened.“We will keep on playing because we love the game and we still want to fight and go as far as we can. After many years of hard work, we are not just going to give up, ” said Shevon.Shevon-Soon Huat have gone through ups and downs like no other pairs.Injuries and illness had slowed them down several times but when they were in peak form, others could not stop them as that was evident when they won the 2018 Singapore Open and German Open.“The easier route is to quit definitely but Soon Huat and I know that if we want to achieve something, we have to go through the hardship, nothing comes easy, ” she said.“Our journey together had not been easy from the start. We were almost out of the national squad in 2016 but then, got to partner again. It meant we had to start from scratch to reach the top in a very short period.“We’ve tried so hard to maintain our form but being in various tough situations has made it more challenging.”Shevon and Soon Huat are currently training under Chin Ee Hui with other independent players.“Training is good. For now, we are looking at the Korean Open as our “warm-up” before the world meet but it all depends on the current Covid-19 situation, ” she added.At the last world meet in Basel in 2019, both of them lost 21-19,25-27,16-21 to Japan’s Takuro Hoki-Wakana Nagahara in the second round."

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",7:02 AM MYT,Sport,,Tennis-Federer slogs past Koepfer in late night battle,"PARIS (Reuters) -Roger Federer reached the last 16 of the French Open but needed all of his fighting qualities to scrap his way past Germany's Dominik Koepfer on an empty and eerie Court Philippe Chatrier in Saturday's night match.The 39-year-old 20-time Grand Slam champion was ragged at times and lacked his usual zip against the tenacious Koepfer but the eighth seed slogged his way to a 7-6(5) 6-7(3) 7-6(4) 7-5 victory with the time approaching 1am local time.It was Federer's first taste of a Grand Slam match played without fans, courtesy of Paris's 9pm COVID-19 curfew, and it was not an experience he seemed to enjoy as he was given a torrid time by the 27-year-old left-hander.Yet the fact Federer prevailed in such surreal circumstances, having hardly played in the last 17 months because of a knee injury, illustrated the passion that still burns within him for the game.Former world number one Andy Murray, watching at home, summed it up nicely on Twitter.""I'm not bothered by the outcome of this match at all. Just seeing Federer at 39 off the back of 2 knee surgeries playing to an empty stadium at 12.30am getting fired up is inspirational to me. Do what you love,"" the Scot wrote.Federer had looked superb in his opening two matches here, but was rattled by the heavy hitting of the world number 59 and struggled for rhythm, racking up 63 unforced errors.But he dug deep to win the night's opening tiebreak, helped by a Koepfer double fault at a crucial moment.Federer piled on the pressure at the start of the second set and secured an early break. But Koepfer broke back and after breaks were traded again, the set reached a tiebreak.Koepfer moved 6-2 ahead as mistakes flowed off Federer's racket and he levelled the match thanks to another unforced error from the Swiss who was playing only his sixth match in 17 months following knee surgery.Federer, the 2009 champion, was wobbling when he dropped serve early in the third but battled back from 2-4 down and after missing a set point in the 12th game he reeled off the last three points of the night's third tiebreak.Sensing his chance of taking the biggest scalp of his career was slipping away, Koepfer's temper boiled over when his service was broken at 1-1 in the fourth and he was docked a point for spitting on the court after a close call went against him.The former American college player was not done though and Federer could not locate the extra gear he usually engages to see off troublesome opponents, dropping serve in the next game.Federer showed amazing reflexes to return a smash when Koepfer served at 5-5 and he pounced for a crucial break as Koepfer struck a forehand over the baseline.The Swiss then held serve to claim a gruelling victory, albeit an ugly one by his usual standards, and set up a clash with Italian Matteo Berrettini.""It was very important for me, I certainly hadn't practised for three hours 35 minutes,"" Federer told reporters. ""I certainly didn't expect to win three matches here.""Playing without fans I knew was going to hit me at some point. It maybe benefits players like myself who are very focussed when they go to practice. It wasn't easy tonight, was unique in many ways, but I'm happy I found a way.""I was playing for all those watching at home on TV.""(Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Pritha Sarkar)"

They don’t only have the numbers but they have the quality and depth in the team too.Except for the mixed doubles, they have two representatives in all other events.They will be represented by two-time world champion Kento Momota, Kanta Tsuneyama in the men’s singles; Nozomi Okuhara, Akane Yamaguchi (women’s singles); Hiroyuki Endo-Yuta Watanabe (pic), Takeshi Kamura-Keigo Sonoda (men’s doubles); Yuki Fukushima-Sayaka Hirota, Mayu Matsumoto-Wakana Nagahara (women’s doubles); and Yuta Watanabe-Arisa Higashino.Yuta will be the outstanding man, who will play in two events – men’s doubles and mixed doubles.Japan’s success in the Olympics only came at a later part when Mizuki Fujii-Reika Kakiiwa became the country’s first gold medallists by triumphing in the women’s doubles at the 2012 London Games.At the 2016 Rio Games, they did better when Nozomi and Misaki Matsutomo-Ayaka Takahashi made it two for Japan in the women’s singles and doubles.In the absence of Carolina Marin of Spain, who has withdrawn due to injury, the path is even clearer for Nozomi to go after her second gold.This year, expect the men to make a strong assault too.Kento, who lost to Malaysia’s Lee Zii Jia in the quarter-finals of the All-England in March this year, is seen as the hot favourite at home while Hiroyuki-Yuta have been on fire, winning the All-England twice in 2020 and 2021.They may have only one pair in Yuta-Arisa in the mixed doubles but the duo are lethal.Currently, Japan are the only team with equal strength in all the events - making it possible to win all five.Head coach Park Joo-bong has been hard at work with his team of coaches and players despite all the challenges in their country, where Covid-19 cases are still rising but based on their work rate, results and sheer determination, a high five at home is possible."

For Laurie Hernandez, the biggest transformation has come from within as she bids to secure a spot on the Tokyo Olympic team.The youngest woman on the entire 2016 U.S. Olympic team, the road to Rio was a dark and lonely one for the then 16-year-old who endured verbal abuse and body shaming on way to helping the United States to the team gold.Later Hernandez would go public with her pain and accused former coach Maggie Haney, who began working with her when she was just five years old, of verbal and emotional pummeling that left her battling eating disorders and depression.Following an investigation by USA Gymnastics, Haney was last April banned from coaching for eight years but later had the suspension reduced to five.Older, wiser and with new coaches in her corner, the journey to Tokyo has been a far more enjoyable one for the 21-year-old Hernandez.""At 16 I was kind of like an eager puppy, just tell me what to do and I'd do it,"" Hernandez told Reuters. ""If you said, alright do a jump, a full turn and then land right on your head I would say, 'ok let's see how we get this done'.""Now I am more in tune with my body and understanding what I need and able to feel when my brain or body is red flagging me to take a break.""Pushed to breaking point both physically and mentally in the run up to Rio, Hernandez was goaded into training through injuries and did so without resistance for fear of incurring Haney's profanity laced wrath.Under Jenny Zhang and Howie Liang, her new mentors, Hernandez is guided and not prodded. She also has input into her training and day-to-day regime.She has also drawn on the strength of her mother, who helped to expose Haney's abuse, while being inspired by her father, who lives with diabetes.MUCH STRONGER""Seeing him take care of himself and check in with his body, being proactive about himself, it made me want to do the same,"" said Hernandez, who is part of Team Lilly assembled by pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly to help shine a light on hidden health barriers.""Going to the Olympics and then stopping and hitting puberty and gaining weight in the public eye, it was something really hard and something I don't think anyone should have to go through,"" said Hernandez.""With the comeback there's the feeling I am not who I was before mentally or physically.""While Haney resisted nature's march, Zhang and Liang have encouraged Hernandez to embrace the changes that come with maturity and use those to her advantage.""The first thing Jenny and Howie said to me was 'listen... you have this body that can turn into muscle and you are going to be so much stronger'.""I'm grateful they were able to see a positive version of my body that I had wanted to see but didn't know how.""Hernandez and her team mates share the Olympic dream but some of them have also shared the horrors of abuse.Five years on from Rio, the sport continues to deal with the trauma inflicted on hundreds of young gymnasts by former-Team USA doctor Larry Nassar, who in 2017-18 was sentenced to hundreds of years in prison for sexually abusing the athletes.""I don't know how any athlete prepares themselves to talk about something so heavy,"" said Hernandez, fully expecting to face difficult questions in the Tokyo run up. ""However, it is the situation we are in.""Sometimes it can be really hard to talk about and it can be very triggering.""At the end of day I'm in the sport because I love it and I have this goal I want to achieve.""Hernandez returned to training in 2019 and takes her first major step towards earning a spot on the U.S. Tokyo team this weekend at the U.S. Championships.The Olympic Trials follow three weeks later.Coming back from such extended layoffs to make the U.S. team is rare.""We're attempting to be human and super human at the same time and live a life outside of our sport and do something nobody has ever done before,"" said Hernandez.""It is quite the job to multi-task and to have to deal with these things and it makes things harder, however, it is who we are and what we are trained to do.""(Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto.

He's young. He's improving every week. He has big shots,"" Nadal said of Sinner, who last year did not hesitate to pile the pressure the Spaniard's forehand - his biggest weapon.""I need to be solid. I need to be aggressive too, because if not it's very difficult. I need to make him play from tough positions, and I can't make a lot of mistakes.""Nadal admitted that he could have had a better draw.""Jannik is not the best fourth round, without a doubt, no, he's a dangerous one.

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",4:01 AM MYT,Sport,,"Tennis-Gauff on a roll, but keeping her guard up","PARIS (Reuters) - Eleven former French Open junior champions began in the women's draw this year and three of them have reached the last 16.None of that list which includes the likes of Elina Svitolina and Belina Bencic, have gone on to lift the Suzanne Lenglen Cup, nor any Grand Slam title for that matter.But in reaching the fourth round at Roland Garros on her second main draw appearance, American 17-year-old Coco Gauff is offering further evidence that she can emulate the likes of Simona Halep and Justine Henin and convert a junior title into one of the game's four big prizes.Gauff, who won the girls' title in 2018, is yet to drop a set so far at Roland Garros this year and will move into the second week brimming with confidence after requiring only 23 minutes on Saturday to get past Australian Open runner-up Jennifer Brady who retired hurt.Gauff made only one unforced error in a one-sided 6-1 set and while Brady was clearly hampered, Gauff was ruthlessly focussed -- a trait she says is vital when switching to the pro ranks.""Every match you have to give your all, 100%,"" Gauff, who stunned the world by reaching the fourth round of Wimbledon aged 15, having come through qualifying in 2019, told reporters.""I have a couple of my friends who are starting that transition from juniors to pro and I would say the biggest thing is just the pace of the ball and the competitiveness, because you have to compete for every point.""On the pro tour, there are not many matches where players are going to check out when they are 6-2 3-0 down. I feel on edge until the last point is played. You can't let your guard down because everybody here wants to win.""Gauff faces tricky Tunisian Ons Jabeur for a place in her first Grand Slam quarter-final -- another former junior champion on the red Parisian clay dust.With so many big names either having lost, withdrawn or unable to play at the French Open, excitement is mounting for Gauff's chances of going deep into the second week.And with the likes of Ukraine's 18-year-old Marta Kostyuk also into the last 16 of the women's draw and Italian 19-year-olds Jannik Sinner and Lorenzo Musetti into the last 16 of the men's draw, Gauff says it's proof of exciting times for tennis.""I think for fans it's probably exciting, becauseit's more like, especially after COVID, a lot of players are starting to retire,"" she said. ""So I think for the fan perspective at least from what people, my family, think it'sinteresting how this new generation of tennis players is coming.""On the guys' side, I notice we have a lot of guys I played in the same tournaments with starting to do well, like Musetti and the Spanish player, Carlos (Alcaraz), I don't know how to pronounce his last name.""I played juniors with them. So it's kind of cool to see us all doing well. Being a part of it is exciting. I hope for you guys it's fun to watch.""(Reporting by Martyn Herman, editing by Pritha Sarkar)"
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Sport,RAJES PAUL,They can be smashing too,"PETALING JAYA: Shuttlers Tan Wee Kiong and Goh V Shem have faith that youngsters Aaron Chia-Soh Wooi Yik will replicate their silver-medal feat at the Tokyo Olympics next month.World No. 13 Wee Kiong-V Shem, both 32, smashed their way to the medal in their Olympics debut in 2016 at Rio de Janeiro, but this year they failed to make the cut.The duo, who were in the running to earn their Games’ tickets, saw their hopes go up in smoke when the last four Olympics qualifiers were scrapped due to the Covid-19 pandemic.However, all is not lost as they believe Games’ debutants Aaron-Wooi Yik have the pedigree to strike it right.The world No. 9, who are the 2019 All-England runners-up, are one of the eight Malaysian shuttlers who have confirmed their tickets. The others are Lee Zii Jia (men’s singles), Soniia Cheah (women’s singles), Lee Meng Yean-Chow Mei Kuan (women’s doubles) and Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying (mixed doubles).“They are young and have huge potential. Just like us in 2016, anything can happen. I hope they will enjoy the experience, ” said Wee Kiong, who became a household name after their surprise feat although they could have won the gold after losing 21-16,11-21,21-23 to Fu Haifeng-Zhang Nan of China in the final.“I remember our outing in Rio. The situation was quite bad – the food, the accommodation and others but the team took everything in a positive way. We always found ways to focus in training and during competition.“And we had a good leader that time – Datuk Lee Chong Wei. He was the most experienced among the lot and I believe, this time, Peng Soon and Liu Ying can offer that leadership.”V Shem also believes Aaron-Wooi Yik will shine.“They have very good first-three shots, all they need is consistency. It’s my hope that they will bring back a medal, ” said V Shem.On their future, V Shem said they are still unsure.“Our contract with Yonex ends next month and we are waiting to see whether they will continue the sponsorship. Besides, there are no tournaments, ” said V Shem.Meanwhile, Wee Kiong is contemplating playing in the mixed doubles with Vivian Hoo.“There has been discussion with Vivian but we are only able to move forward if there are sponsors. I will also have to discuss with V Shem on our future.“For now, due to the current situation, we just have to wait.”"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,Sport,,China’s Zhang soars on eagles’ wings at the Memorial,"Washington: China’s Zhang Xinjun showed a welcome return to form by firing two eagles for a four-under 68 in the second which propelled him to a tied 15th place at the Memorial Tournament.Starting his round from the 10th hole, the 33-year-old Zhang brilliantly sank a seven iron approach from 194 yards on the par-four 17th hole at Muirfield Village and then found the bottom of the cup with his third shot from the greenside bunker on the par-five 7th hole for his second eagle of the day.The China star made four other birdies against just as many bogeys to put himself in position for back-to-back top-10s in the PGA Tour tournament hosted by Jack Nicklaus following his T10 last season.Zhang’s two-day total of three-under 141 sees him trailing second round clubhouse leader Patrick Cantlay by five strokes. Cantlay, a three-time Tour winner, fired a 67 for an eight-under 136 total to put himself in prime spot to win the Memorial Tournament for a second time in three years. Defending champion Jon Rahm was also at eight-under through 13 holes of his round when play was suspended due to fading light.After opening with a 73, Masters Tournament champion Hideki Matsuyama, who was the Memorial winner in 2014, moved up to T8 after negotiating 14 holes of his round in five-under.Currently ranked 165th on the FedExCup ranking, Zhang snapped a frustrating streak of nine successive missed cuts at last week’s Charles Schwab Challenge where he finished tied 73rd. He was relieved his recent hard work was finally rewarded on Friday.“For the weekend, I need to stay as positive as I was today and deal with mistakes rationally. I played very well, and I hope to carry on over the final two days,” said Zhang.South Korea’s Kang Sung-hoon added a 72, which featured four birdies, two bogeys and one double bogey, to his opening 70 for T21 while Taiwan’s C.T. Pan will enter the weekend in T43 after his 70 in the second round."

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,Sport,,There is ‘some good’ amidst all this bad,"THE Covid-19 pandemic has wrecked havoc cross the globe, and continues to do so unabated.But the time of lockdown has also allowed golf courses and nurseries, even those operating with just 30% staff of normal capacity, the time to rejuvenate and in some cases, come into full bloom.Of the more than 20-odd golf clubs and related establishments TeeUp spoke to this week, all said they had elevated the condition of their properties by several notches in the time there has been with no player traffic.“Of course, the closure of the course to players has hurt the financial side of operations,” said one general manager from the Klang Valley, just as any other business would be.“But we fully respect the efforts being made by everybody concerned to try and help curb the spread of the Coronavirus and we will continue to support this.“What the lockdown has also done though, is allow us to get more out of our own efforts to improve the condition of the golf course,” he added.Following are excerpts from the interviews conducted with some of the representatives of the golf clubs:Forest City International Golf ResortManagement , Malaysia & SingaporeDESPITE the loss of money-making in these difficult times, there is still a bright side to the lockdowns for golf clubs and courses.The greens, like all the plant life on a golf course, are a living organisms, so we need to regularly maintain them by providing enough nutrients, trimming and watering.And the absence of wear and tear from daily use means the greens are in great condition. The zero-patron period has been great for maintenance works to revitalise the greens and other areas of the course, such as bunkers and irrigation systems.But we would still love to see the players return. Golf is a safe activity with physical distancing as it is a contactless sport and with a maximum of four people playing together in a flight they can measure 100m or more apart at any one time.Golf is also a moderate level physical activity. Regardless of age, it has a positive health effect – boosting among other things, mobility and fitness. We are truly hoping that things get better and we are looking forward to get up and running again once the situation allows.Gunung Raya Golf ResortPei Ling, Senior Executive, Sales & MarketingOUR Gunung Raya Golf Resort features is an 18-holes international-standard golf course spread over some 300 acres of former rubber plantation land.When play is allowed to resume again, and in light of the on-going maintenance and recent improvements, golfers will be able to enjoy an exciting game with the scenic backdrop of the valley of Gunung Raya, access to leisure areas like the Club Cafe, a patio overlooking the golf course, as well as other facilities.And as part of our golf course cultural practices, we have just completed green renovations to get the putting surfaces in real healthy condition, and in the process provide good green speeds and a true roll.We pride ourselves on allowing the player to get the most out of their golfing experience here – where sport and nature come together in a perfect blend.With our continued maintenance work and operations on-course during the lockdowns, despite this being reduced to 30% from full capacity, we have been able to present a course that is top-class.Templer Park Country ClubDatuk Manibalan Kutty , DirectorWITHOUT the player traffic due to the lockdown, the state of the golf course has been uplifted significantly. The club has had sufficient time to do the normal culture practice like hollow-tining and verticut that enhance the condition of the green.We also took advantage of the situation to further improve the drainage system on the fairways and getting rid of wild grasses.So, I must say that the golf course is in good condition and that all divots have been fully covered by turf.We were worried that with no work possible during this lockdown, it would have damaged the golf course. But we are happy now that maintenance operations have been allowed to continue.Golf course maintenance is not like a restaurant or office where you can just close and come back in 14 days to reopen. We are dealing with living grasses that need daily attention, in some cases.We need people to monitor the situation constantly and make sure there are sufficient nutrients, sunlight and water for the grass to stay healthy.Palm Garden Golf ClubTerence Lee , Assistant General ManagerThe current course condition is good as we have been able to organise and manage our field department team to work on major areas that needed special attention.Some of the areas that we focused on were the greens, tee boxes, hollow-tining fairways and repairing sap soil.The golf course irrigation is also important, more so with the current warm season. If the grass does not receive adequate water, large areas can quickly die. Depending on the length of time without water, complete turf loss can occur.Our routine bunker maintenance is done so as to create good playing conditions. Of course, if the bunkers are not maintained, weeds will eventually take over and cover the sand. Unmaintained bunkers are also vulnerable to serious decline from soil erosion if they remain un-repaired.The pros and cons of a situation are like this is: a) The club can take the opportunity to do much cultural practice and maintenance on the golf course, and b) Without golfers coming to play the club’s revenue is badly affected."

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Metro,,Over 50 malls nationwide offer to be vaccination centres,"MORE than 50 shopping complexes nationwide are keen to set up a vaccination centre (PPV) on their premises under the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme for the retail sector.Malaysia Shopping Malls Association (PPK) president Tan Sri Teo Chiang Kok said in a statement that the initiative received good response from its members.“It is imperative that the vaccination exercise for retail employees is expedited as this will protect our frontliners and the public.“We appreciate that our proposal for on-site vaccination centres at malls is adopted as it is more efficient and logical for medical personnel to administer the vaccine at the site instead of retail workers taking time off to travel to vaccination centres outside, ” he said.Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said on May 28 that the programme aimed to vaccinate 500,000 employees in the retail sector.Currently, details about the programme and proposed locations to be turned into PPV are still being finalised.Teo said he looked forward to rolling out the programme by the end of this month once it was approved by the ministry.On May 31, internal memos from a few shopping centres offering retail workers the option to register for on-site vaccination were sent to tenants.The memo also detailed a small fee to be borne by tenants if they chose to vaccinate their employees under this programme, where ProtectHealth Corporation (ProtectHealth) will provide doctors and nurses to administer the vaccine.According to ProtectHealth’s website, the company has been appointed by Health Ministry as the implementer of private medical practitioners’ participation in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.A wholly-owned subsidiary of ProtectHealth Malaysia established under Health Ministry, ProtectHealth is stated as a not-for-profit company that coordinates, administers and manages initiatives related to financing healthcare services as mandated by the ministry.A medical news portal reported that the company denied collecting payments from shopping centres purportedly rolling out Covid-19 inoculation drives with its vaccinators.The article quoted a representative from the corporate communication unit, Khairul Faizi, who said ProtectHealth’s involvement remained the same for all vaccination centres.“We pay private medical practitioners RM14 per dose administered.“We don’t supply vaccines as our role is managing the private medical practitioners. The vaccine supply is done by the government similar to other vaccination centres, ” he was quoted as saying.ProtectHealth could not be reached for comments at press time.On the fee incurred under the programme, Teo said he was unhappy with negative comments in the media that malls were profiteering from this exercise, which was far from the truth.“The enthusiastic participation of the malls together with the overwhelming registration by the staff and their tenants are testimonies of the urgent need for greater access to vaccination.“Malls are paying for the fees for medical officers appointed by ProtectHealth and all other antecedent costs.“We were also informed that the medical personnel providing their services allocated by Protect Health will charge RM15 to administer a vaccine dose.“We estimate that the cost of providing the venue, logistics, manpower and ambulance services for the on-site vaccination centre will amount to between RM100 and RM150 per person, depending on the number of doses available each day, number of participants to be vaccinated and the duration to complete the programme.“In the interest of the national agenda, it was decided that the malls would subsidise these costs and be allowed to charge RM20 per person for logistic costs to partially defray their expenses.“Adding the RM30 to complete the course, a total of RM50 will be charged to participants.“We are grateful to our malls for recognising the need to subsidise the costs to help in this national objective towards inoculating all retail frontliners to protect the shopping and retail industry as our overall CSR contribution towards the national agenda of achieving herd immunity urgently, ” he said."

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Metro,C.Y. LEE,Courageous 10-year-old’s virtual concert brings joy,"DESPITE being diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia — a rare form found in only one in 1,000 leukaemia patients — 10-year-old Leong Yu Qing is filled with passion for life.Instead of letting fear and depression engulf her, Yu Qing from Pahang prefers to sing and dance to uplift people.On Feb 20, Make-A-Wish Malaysia granted the little girl her unique wish to learn singing and dancing so she could hold her very own solo concert.Despite undergoing treatment, Yu Qing prepared for her concert with help from the organisation. She attended dance classes, courtesy of Jean Gan Ballet School.Make-A-Wish Malaysia also gifted her a karaoke set for her to practise her skills.Yu Qing chose to sing Josh Groban’s You Raise Me Up, in dedication to her parents Stanley Leong and Ally Goh, as well as Thanks and Listen To Me Thank You in gratitude to all those who had helped her.Leong and Goh have been extremely supportive of their daughter and recorded her practice and progress along the way. All this provided them some relief amid the treatments and effects of the movement control order.In accordance with the Covid-19 SOP, Yu Qing’s concert was held in the safety of her home and attended only by her family.Selangor princess and Make-A-Wish royal patron Tengku Zatashah Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah was among the online audience, and when the curtains were raised, nothing could keep the young star from making her wish to shine come true.Her recorded concert is now available on the Make-A-Wish YouTube channel (Make-A-Wish Malaysia).Since debuting on the charity’s channel in April, it has surpassed over 2,000 likes. Encouraged by the positive response, the aim now is to get 5,000 likes.Yu Qing’s wish, like many other children’s, was planned and executed by a team of Make-A-Wish trained volunteers.It was made possible by donations raised by Jean Gan’s Family Stretchercise classes held online last year where participants from Malaysia, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom made donations amounting to over RM14,000, helping to grant three other wishes besides Yu Qing’s.“Yu Qing’s battle against acute promyelocytic leukemia isn’t over yet and she remains upbeat and even looks forward to going back to school again when it is safe to do so.“We hope her wish story can serve as an encouragement to everyone, ” said Make-A-Wish Malaysia chief executive officer Irene Tan.Its vice-chairman Datuk Linda Ngiam lauded Yu Qing’s family for their resilience during this very difficult time.“In the midst of this pandemic, we are delighted to have met Yu Qing, a bright and confident child who has much to teach us about resilience and courage.“Her positivity and cheerfulness are contagious.“This is a wonderful example of how a wish can bring the community together, starting with the fundraising event in Hong Kong and now, granting a wish in Pahang, ” she said."

In addition, you are all part of the class in which our 2000th graduate was conferred, ” Prof Whitford told graduates.Established as the first accredited private medical institution in Malaysia, RUMC has since become a leading medical education provider.Its vast network of alumni practise medicine in various countries around the world.Besides virtual conferment of the medical degrees, the ceremony last Sunday also honoured prize winners for first places in the final examination.Top of the pack in Psychiatry as well as Obstetrics and Gynaecology was Melissa Mae Gabriel. The Kuala Lumpur native was also the Student Valedictorian for the Class of 2021.Melissa professed a love for reading biographies of missionaries and surgeons from a young age. This developed her interest in medicine, which she said fuses both science and art.“I find dealing with people of different walks of life very interesting. I also wanted to serve the community, especially those who are less fortunate or more vulnerable, ” she said about her chosen career path.Wan Muhammad Izhar Wan Ismail, a MARA-sponsored student, took first place in Medicine and was overjoyed to have also made it into this year’s Dean’s List.“This is such a huge honour and a strong motivation for me to always believe in myself, to move further forward and to keep learning, ” he shared.Two other MARA-sponsored students, Nur Syahirah Abd Rahim and Syamimi Amirah Mohamad Amin, also won first prizes in Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology respectively.Chan Chet Ying, who got first in both Surgery and Paediatrics, was drawn to the unique medical education offered, which comprises stints in Ireland and Penang.“I put in a lot of effort into my studies but being one of the prize winners was totally unexpected. I am eternally grateful to God, my family and all my lecturers for their guidance and support throughout my years in medical school, ” Chan said.Gershon Joses Ventour, an international student from Trinidad & Tobago, finished as the Best All-Round Student this year.He revealed that discipline is the most important quality one needs to be a successful medical student and eventually a doctor.Other prize winners included Melvin Hoo Chuin Shen, Eunice Lim Yuying, Raveena Kaur Dhadli and Sidi Muhammad Yusoff Azli Shah.A collection of congratulatory messages to the Class of 2021 was also shared from the academics of RUMC, RCSI (Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland), UCD (University College Dublin) and NUI (National University of Ireland), throughout the ceremony.They included NUI chancellor Dr Maurice Manning; RCSI University of Medicine & Health Sciences president Prof Ronan O’Connell; RCSI University of Medicine & Health Sciences chief executive and registrar Prof Cathal Kelly and RCSI dean of the Medicine and Health Sciences faculty Prof Hannah McGee.Also offering words of congratulations and encouragement were UCD dean and head of School of Medicine Prof Michael Keane and RUMC dean Prof Dr Premnath Nagalingam.The September intake for RUMC’s Undergraduate programme in Medicine is now open for enquiries.Visit www.rcsiucd.edu.my or call 04-2171888 for more information.For general enquiries, write to enquiry@rcsiucd.edu.my or call 04-2171999."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Metro,SHALINI RAVINDRAN - CITYCISM,Resilience will keep us on road to recovery,"IF THE start of the Covid-19 pandemic last year saw Malaysians apprehensive but hopeful, the same cannot be said about the latest round of movement restrictions this year.There was no more talk of Dalgona coffees, the best ways to bake banana bread or trying out a new hobby as the country began a new lockdown on June 1.In March 2020, we met the pandemic with not just optimism but with heart, knowing that we would do whatever it took to weather this worldwide problem.Even as most economic sectors were forced to close and job losses increased during this traumatic period, we heard inspiring stories of people stepping up to help others in need — from donating food and essentials to looking after elderly neighbours who were separated from their loved ones.We supported the tireless dedication of our medical and non-medical frontliners with contributions of medical supplies and even meals to officers manning roadblocks.More importantly, we supported them by limiting our travels and staying indoors to break the chain of infection.It all paid off and we were definitely quite pleased with ourselves when cases dropped down to nearly zero, while other countries in the region, and what was thought of as developed countries, were seeing soaring cases and busy holding rallies against government-imposed restrictions.But more than a year later, the situation is reversed — Covid-19 cases are at an all-time high and the public healthcare system is overwhelmingly burdened.The latest figures show that almost 900 individuals are receiving treatment at intensive care units (ICU).Although more ICU beds for Covid-19 patients have been added, the rate of use of ICU beds is still at a level above 100%, revealed Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah.We saw the signs — massive crowds at bazaars, in-person gatherings as well as increased clusters caused by interstate travel.Meanwhile at workplaces, operations resumed at almost full capacity.Between April 1 and May 26,287 workplace clusters involving 17,087 cases were recorded, with 233 clusters involving 16,785 cases still active.A total of 115 workplace clusters with 5,392 cases were reported between May 12 and 26, of which 62 involved the manufacturing sector.Where at the time the government stressed that it was not a lockdown –- using the term “movement control order” instead –- that was not the case this time around as Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced a “lockdown” of most economic sectors and all social sectors throughout the country for two weeks.Tighter restrictions before this lockdown — such as that which mandates more employees work from home and shorter business operating hours — had barely made a dent in daily cases that were skyrocketing.There is a deeper sense of anxiety given the intensity of the wave, the death toll and the prolonged nature of the pandemic.At this point, most of us almost certainly know someone who has contracted Covid-19 or has succumbed to the disease.“It has become harder to remain optimistic when everything seems to be going wrong. Just to keep going has become truly hard work, ” a friend said to me recently.She lamented how the pandemic has become characterised by repetition.“I drive the same route from home to work, and back again, the weekends are reserved for a quick trip to stock up on groceries, with very little to look forward to the rest of the time, ” she said.The monotony of the past 18 months is hard to process, and one that I am sure is a sentiment shared by many.There are, however, plenty of ways to break up our daily routine, be it with virtual visits to world-famous museums or researching future travel destinations that gives us something to look forward to.I believe Malaysians have always been a resilient lot and we can find ways to weather the coming months.Let us learn from our mistakes, or risk being a cautionary tale. We did it once and we can do it again.While we wait patiently for our first vaccine dose, we must rally together now and commit to this round of lockdown so that we can return to a post-coronavirus world sooner rather than later."
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Metro,CY LEE,"Jogging, light exercise done individually in open spaces allowed","ONLY jogging and light exercising with adherence to physical distancing are allowed during the current lockdown.The standard operating procedure announced by the National Security Council (NSC) also limits the two activities to open spaces in a neighbourhood which can only be carried out between 7am and 8pm.Additionally, the activities must be done on an individual basis while physical distancing requirements have become stricter as every person must now be two to three metres apart from another individual.The latest NSC rules exclude cycling from the list of activities allowed under sports and recreation.At the same time, all sports and recreational facilities --- both public and private --- will remain closed throughout the lockdown.Meanwhile, almost all public parks in Selangor under the jurisdiction of local authorities will be closed.When contacted, local authorities in Shah Alam, Petaling Jaya, Subang Jaya, Kajang, Klang, Selayang, Sepang and Kuala Langat confirmed that public parks under their respective jurisdictions will remain closed.Subang Jaya resident Darren Lee said he had hoped that public parks would be open during this period.“We spend so much time cooped up in the house, even working from home, so sometimes I just need to get out and go to the park where there is greenery, to unwind.“My housing area is not conducive for jogging as the roads are narrow and there is just no comparison to jogging in a big open park, ” said the 32-year-old electrical engineer.“I would normally go to the Subang Ria park a few times a week as it was nearest to me. Plus, it has a nice lake, so it is relaxing.” — By CY LEE"
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Metro,JAROD LIM，VIJENTHI NAIR,"‘Vaccination at malls, please’","OVER 60% of the tenants at several shopping complexes in the Klang Valley agreed to be included in the Economic Frontliners Vaccination Programme (retail sector) and have employees at their outlets get vaccinated.Shopping centres are currently applying to Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) to host vaccination centres (PPV) on their premises so retailers can sign up for on-site vaccination.Central i-City Shopping Centre chief operating officer Anthony Dylan said 65% of its tenants supported the initiative.“We are hoping at least 70% of the mall’s tenants will register with us as we play our part in achieving herd immunity as soon as possible.“We are proposing one floor of the carpark to be designated as a vaccination centre, with drive-through function.“The location is an alternative to event halls and large-scale venues to get the vaccination done.“It is conducive with natural ventilation, proper ingress and egress ramps for drive-through as well as as a suitable location nearby to store the vaccine in accordance with government requirements.”CapitaLand, which manages seven malls namely 3 Damansara, Melawati Mall, The Mines and Sungei Wang Plaza in Klang Valley, Gurney Plaza as well as Queensbay Mall in Penang and East Coast Mall in Kuantan (Pahang), had also written to the authorities to consider using three of its malls as vaccination centres.“We are awaiting further clarifications from the authorities on costs and operational requirements.“We have communicated with our tenants to take part in this programme, ” said CapitaLand Malaysia Retail head Eddie Lim.“More than 80% of our tenants are interested to sign up for the vaccination programme for retail frontliners.“As our malls remain open during this period, the vaccination exercise will help protect the health and well-being of our shoppers, tenants and staff.“Our aim is to help the government look at different ideas for decentralisation and expedite the whole vaccination process, ” he said.Sunway Malls and Theme Parks chief executive officer HC Chan said Sunway Malls planned to join the PPV drive rolled out by the government.“This is still in the early stages and we applaud the government’s efforts to speed up vaccination by opening multiple channels across public and private sectors.“The road to recovery hinges on how fast and how wide the vaccination reaches the population.“Sunway had rolled out the first private large-scale vaccination centre for frontliners and the general population in Petaling district since March 2021 at Sunway Pyramid Convention Centre.“Sunway Malls has a staff strength of 12,000.“These retail frontliners, especially those in the essential sectors such as supermarket, convenience stores, food and beverage operators as well as pharmacies are in contact with the public daily, thus it is important that they get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and visitors.“Our ultimate aim is to work closely with the government to achieve herd immunity as fast as possible, ” he added.Meanwhile, Bangsar Village 2 could be used as a vaccination centre for workers in the Telawi commercial area.Eng Lian Enterprise Sdn Bhd, which manages Bangsar Village 1,2 and 3 apart from some commercial lots in the area, has offered space for a vaccination centre.Its leasing manager Vincent Siow said the company had identified a vacant lot on the third floor of Bangsar Village 2 to be used for a vaccination exercise.Not only would it benefit its retailers’ staff, he said the management had also proposed to include workers in the Telawi commercial centre.“We are ready to work with the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) and KPDNHEP to propose Bangsar Village 2 as a vaccination centre to speed up the national vaccination programme.“The response from retailers has been encouraging.“If all goes well, we expect about 4,000 workers to receive their vaccination here, ” he said.Suria KLCC in Kuala Lumpur is another mall offering to be a vaccination centre.Suria KLCC Sdn Bhd, which manages the mall, issued a letter to its retailers on May 31 to submit names of employees interested to be inoculated at the premises by June 1.The letter stated that the vaccination exercise will begin sometime this month.The tenants that StarMetro spoke to at various malls said they were supportive of the vaccination initiative despite a nominal fee being charged to tenants.Caring Pharmacy senior pharmacy practice executive Ng Yi Ling said the company was supportive of the programme for shopping centres to be vaccination centres for their retailers.“Our staff at Caring outlets nationwide are retail frontliners who deal with a huge number of customers, so they are exposed to a certain level of risk during this Covid-19 pandemic.“Vaccination for our staff is the best way to protect themselves and at the same time, boosts customer confidence when patronising our stores.“It is also geared towards achieving herd immunity the soonest possible.“Caring encourages all our staff to be vaccinated once the request to set up a vaccination centre in malls is approved by the government, ” she told StarMetro.The pharmacy currently has 144 outlets nationwide with more than 1,100 staff, including pharmacists.Ng opined that a small fee charged to tenants in order to get their workers vaccinated was reasonable.“The company is willing to chip in as part of its responsibility to get as many employees as we can vaccinated, ” she said.Din Tai Fung Malaysia business development director Jeffrey Lim said all its restaurant employees, excluding pregnant women and those with allergies, were supportive of the programme and wanted to get vaccinated as soon as possible.“Our 11 restaurants nationwide serve customers on a daily basis and we are very heartened to be considered as frontliners.“We believe that we can do our part in flattening the curve by getting vaccinated.“The company is also bearing the costs for our employees to ensure their safety, ” he said.TGV Cinemas sales and marketing general manager Mohit Bhargava said the company was fully supportive of the initiative.“We have enlisted our staff as part of the vaccination programme being rolled out at the shopping centres where we are tenants.“It is a collective effort to achieve herd immunity and definitely our frontline staff’s safety is our priority, ” he said, adding that TGV had more than 700 employees nationwide.A nominal fee is charged per employee at various malls for the logistics and administration of the two doses of the vaccines arranged by Protect Health Corporation."

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",,Metro,SHEILA SRI PRIYA,MBPJ: Licence renewal can be delayed if sales down,"INDEPENDENT live music venue operators in Petaling Jaya, Selangor will not be penalised if they do not renew their licence for this year due to a drop in business following the movement control order.They are also assured of not losing their licence altogether if they are unable to pay the fees as well as taxes.A Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) spokesperson said the matter was discussed during council meetings and a decision was made to allow the businesses to delay licence renewal and tax payment.“We understand the predicament of such business owners.“They do not have to worry about not being able to get their licence back when they resume business after the Covid-19 situation ends, ” she said.The spokesperson said the licence fee was paid to MBPJ while the entertainment tax went to the state government.She also advised owners of such businesses to notify the city council’s Licensing Department on their present inability to make payment.MBPJ said this in response to pleas from business operators after they received notices from the council to renew their licences.One of them was Brian Gomez who co-owns Merdekaraya, a grassroots live music venue that supported over 400 local budding artistes.He called on local authorities to waive the entertainment licence fees and taxes as the outlets had not been able to open during the MCO.He hoped to be exempted from paying the fees for this year and 2022.He said business had been badly affected since last year.“The total sum for entertainment licence and tax for my establishment is about RM8,000 a year.“We pay the fees at the end of each year for the following year.“We paid in full for 2020 but we could only operate for about a month during the MCO, ” he added.Gomez said he renewed his licence for this year as he was worried that he would not be able to get a licence to operate when the MCO was eventually lifted.He was among the business proprietors who were sent a notice by MBPJ to settle his licence fee.“I worry that if I do not renew the licence, I may lose it altogether. Hence I have updated the licence for this year, ” he said.Gomez was glad that MBPJ addressed the issue and hoped the fee for 2022 would be waived.“Budding artistes and the local music industry need a lot of support since they have been very badly hit by this pandemic, ” he added.MBPJ councillor Derek Fernandez said he would request the city council to consider a new policy to allow fees paid last year to be rolled over to this year while taking into account periods under the MCO.“The director of licensing in fact informed me that business owners were advised not to send in an application to renew their licences during MCO but apply only when they could operate, ” he said.In the case of Merdekaraya, he said the owner would appeal to pay only a pro-rated amount when he was allowed to resume business."

Ravindran echoed the same sentiments that a bank loan moratorium would help everyone.“For instance, those renting shops may be able to give discounts to their tenants if given a bank loan moratorium.“The tenants, who are business owners, will then be able to retain some of their workforce, ” he pointed out.Meanwhile, Johor Baru Business and Hawker Association president Roland Lim hopes the state speeds up plans to introduce economic stimulus packages.“Johor government should focus on helping businesses as this will allow more people to keep their jobs, ” he said.Next week, Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad is expected to announce aid for Johoreans under its Economic Stimulus Plan 3.0 – which is a continuation of the existing two packages announced since last year.Under the latest package, he said the focus would not just be about providing handouts to those affected but to also enhance the state’s management of the pandemic.Under the first stimulus package, RM167mil was spent to help 295,464 people.The second stimulus package saw 387,674 people benefit from a disbursement of RM109mil."

The total number of positive cases has exceeded 250.Residents alarmed by the spike in cases have been stocking up on household essentials.Retiree Din Ismail, 66, who lives at the Bayu Nyaman flats, said he and his wife had stocked up food to last two weeks.“There are eight people in my house including my children and grandchildren, as such we are not taking any chances.“While one person from every household can go out to buy, my children are working and I can’t be running around all the time, ” he lamented.Din, who runs a coffee stall below his flats, said in the past year, people had undergone several MCOs and were ready to face any eventualities.Resident Jaan Sajkhan Abdul Kadir, 42, is however concerned for his 64-year-old mother who has to go for her kidney dialysis.“I take her to the dialysis centre three times a week and I am worried if it will be possible for me to do so during the enhanced MCO, ” he said.Jaan who does house renovations, said his business was badly affected due to the lockdown and enhanced MCO.Ramli Khamis who sells seafood beside a mini market at the Sri Bayu Apartments, is worried whether his suppliers could come to the area to deliver the seafood products.“There is no clear picture how the enhanced MCO is going to affect our business, but I will somehow carry on as it is a matter of survival, ” he said.Rohana Idris, 42, and her daughter who was seen carrying several bags of fresh and dry food and vegetables, said the provisions were for her family for the next two weeks as she cannot travel to her workplace in Bayan Lepas due to the enhanced MCO.Housewife M.

"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",,Metro,VIJENTHI NAIR,Sepang switches to online parking system,"SEPANG Municipal Council’s (MPSepang) parking system is now digitalised in line with Selangor government’s efforts to turn the municipality into a smart city.The council is moving away from prepaid parking scratch cards to an online system called GoPayy from June 15.All businesses previously selling scratch cards have been recruited as GoPayy agents.Motorists who want to use the parking facility are required to give their vehicle registration number to the agent and pay for the duration needed.The agent records the information in the GoPayy system, in real time, before issuing a receipt. There is no physical coupon.MPSepang president Datuk Abd Hamid Hussain said the municipality was the first in the state to implement an e-coupon method as it progresses toward green technology and achieving zero carbon emissions.“We will set up booths in selected areas to introduce the GoPayy system to the public, ” he said.Abd Hamid said GoPayy was a convenient way for motorists to pay parking fees and even those without smartphones could use it.“Making payment via GoPayy is easy.“Users give their vehicle registration number to the agent and pay according to the time needed. A receipt will be issued.“The receipt will contain details such as vehicle registration number, start and end of parking period, date and area.“The difference between an e-coupon and scratch coupon is that the information is recorded in real time via the GoPayy system, making it easier for enforcement to be carried out, ” he said.“The new method will also avoid confusion among the public on the proper way to scratch a coupon and will prevent cheating as some people scratch the ticket improperly.”The parking charges remain unchanged — free for the first 30 minutes, 42sen for the first hour or part thereof, RM2.52 for six hours or maximum per day and RM63.60 per month.Areas in Cyberjaya are charged 42sen per hour.Payment hours are between 8.30am and 6.30pm, from Monday to Friday."
"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",,Metro,JADE CHAN,New roles on the ground,"AFTER watching dedicated people rendering their services when she got her Covid-19 vaccination in early May, flight attendant Shazana Yazmin Zulkurnain decided to sign up when the opportunity arose to help at a vaccination centre (PPV) in Selangor.“It was inspiring to see the staff and volunteers helping those of us who were getting vaccinated at the World Trade Centre Kuala Lumpur (WTCKL) PPV, ” said the 33-year-old.“Soon after, I came across a job advertisement calling for part-time staff to work at the Ideal Convention Centre (IDCC) in Shah Alam and I applied for it. I was not sure about the role but I was told it would be related to customer service and crowd control, ” she said.Shazana, who started work at IDCC PPV on May 24 making daily announcements of new arrivals, said her 13-year airline experience helped in her new job.“My duty is to explain to people about the process flow at the PPV and what they have to do at each station, which is similar to the pre-boarding and in-flight announcements, ” she said.“The environment at the PPV is like in an airplane. I’m happy to work daily since this is what I do best and I feel at home when I’m here.”The single mother with a five-year-old son said she welcomed the job even though the hours were long, as she desperately needed some income. She has been surviving on minimum wage and savings after being furloughed in March last year.Her experience struggling to make ends meet is similar to many others from the aviation industry, which was one of the sectors hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.Dzin Norain Hishamuddin Kamal Rabah said he got 20 of his fellow flight attendants to join him after he successfully secured a part-time job at the IDCC PPV.“My background as an airline crew member and experience with customer service helped in my new role, ” said the 35-year-old better known as Dzin who has been in the industry for 12 years.“In an Airbus A330, we handle 377 persons per flight. At IDCC, we deal with 10 times that number with some 3,000 people to be vaccinated daily.“My role is to facilitate the vaccination process and let people know when to expect their next appointment.”Dzin said there were similarities and differences between his old job and new one.“As airline crew, we are responsible for the passengers’ safety and welfare.“We also calm passengers down if they are new to flying, ” said the Kuala Lumpur resident.“At the PPV, I help to make people feel comfortable and understand the vaccination process, so that they do not feel the pain of the actual needle.”Dzin said he was able to support himself through e-sports and helping friends with odd jobs after most flights were grounded last year.Christina Supang’s daily duty of doing data entry allowed her to put that skill to use while dealing with all kinds of personalities.“People skills are very important.“Sometimes certain data is missing from their form, so I have to explain what happened and then get the data from them.“We also have a small team managing a large crowd, so we have to be able to handle that.“After securing the job, I was initially hesitant because I didn’t know what I had to do.“But now I’m happy to apply what I was trained for as an airline crew member, ” said the Miri native who has 10 years of flying experience.She observed that despite people’s concerns, it was good to see so many turn up at the PPV to get themselves vaccinated.Christina, 35, said she did odd jobs and sold her artwork online to earn some income after being furloughed.Shazana, Dzin and Christina are eager to resume their old jobs should some semblance of normalcy resume and more international flights allowed.But not all of the part-time staff here are from the aviation sector, as those working in other industries have also faced tough times.For (Capt) Dr Vijayakumar Krishnan Sammy, the volunteer stint at the IDCC PPV was an opportunity to earn some fixed income over a two-week period.“My last job before Covid-19 hit was at a telecommunications infrastructure company in Myanmar, ” said the 43-year-old who has worked in the telecommunications field across 38 countries for the past 28 years.“Due to visa issues and lockdown complications, I was unable to resume that job.“I tried applying for hundreds of jobs locally and overseas, but was unsuccessful in securing one for various reasons.”The single father — who has a private pilot’s licence — said he had taken on a temporary job as a delivery driver to support his three teenage sons and pay the rent for his apartment in Bandar Sunway, Petaling Jaya.“My job here at the IDCC PPV is to confirm appointments.“It is something new to me but I’m willing to learn, ” said Vijayakumar.“In addition to sharing work experiences with others in the team here, this is also an opportunity to meet a lot of people and maybe even a potential future employer.”Customer service par excellenceEmployment agency Q Talent Global Resources Sdn Bhd owner Zarina Ismail said there were about 80 crew members from three Malaysia-based airlines manning the floor at the IDCC PPV, along with 20 others from other industries or fresh graduates.“They handle everything except the medical aspects of the programme. Their duties include customer service, data entry and crowd control, ” she said.“The airline crew’s advantage is that they are well-trained in customer service and first aid, so they are prepared to handle the crowd and possible emergencies.“They are very professional and efficient. There have not been any complaints or hiccups so far.“We have received lots of positive feedback about the staff’s efficiency and smooth vaccination flow here, ” she said.Happy with the opening of many PPVs under the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, Zarina said it had several benefits apart from getting Malaysians vaccinated.“It offers work opportunities to those who lost their jobs and those whose income was badly affected by the pandemic.“The volunteers here are willing to work long hours and remain professional and committed to their jobs, despite the minimal allowance, ” she said.Zarina said members of the non-clinical team at IDCC PPV were paid RM75 per shift and that there were two shifts daily.“They are grateful to have a job now, albeit a temporary one.“Many still have monthly commitments such as servicing housing loans and feeding their families, so they are grateful for this opportunity, ” she added.IDCC PPV is expected to handle about 3,000 people per day from May 24 to June 6.It is one of the venues for the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine opt-in exercise.QueueMed Healthtech Sdn Bhd strategic planning director Nic Tai said his digital healthcare solutions company was appointed by the government to run the IDCC PPV.“QueueMed handles the healthcare organisation and queue system aspects through collaborations with our clinical partners, ” he said.“Q Talent provides partnership and support for this programme.“They handle the manpower for the non-clinical side and train the team to ensure the entire vaccination process is smooth.”Tai said there were 90 to 95 workers daily at the IDCC PPV, with about 40% handling the clinical aspects while 60% the non-clinical duties.Zarina said IDCC had been cited as an exemplary PPV.“I have about 300 airline crew members on the waiting list who are eager for similar jobs, ” she said, adding that Q Talent also had a few volunteers posted at WTC Kuala Lumpur PPV."
"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",,Metro,BAVANI M.,Cultivating hope for the homeless,"THE adage, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime” rings true for the first batch of homeless who were rescued from the streets of Kuala Lumpur in January.They are now a step closer to becoming independent after reaping the fruits of their labour at Anjung Kelana — a transformation centre that not only houses them but also provides land so they can learn farming and grow crops.“They are doing very well and some have shown keen interest in farming, ” said Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) Community Development and Urban Wellbeing Department deputy director Mohamed Asrak Mohd Osman.“It was not easy initially, but upon seeing their harvest of fresh cucumbers, they were excited, ” he said, adding that cucumbers were picked for planting as they were easy to grow.The cucumbers were sold at shops and markets around Anjung Kelana in the Taman Desa neighbourhood.A pilot project initiated by Federal Territories Ministry and managed by DBKL, Anjung Kelana aims to transform the lives of people who have been rescued from the streets.Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Association for the Homeless and Needy is also collaborating with the authorities on the project.Mohamed Asrak said apart from 412kg of cucumbers, 90kg of kangkung and 79kg of ladies’ fingers, there was also corn waiting to be harvested.Many of the occupants at the centre were left stranded after losing their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.They had no place to stay and with no money, they were forced to live on the streets and depended on the generosity of Good Samaritans.Following the success of the urban farming programme, 11 individuals were chosen to undergo training as “Kebun Hijrah Warriors” at a farm in Janda Baik, Pahang.The objective is for them to inspire others to take up farming as a means to earn a living.“These candidates will spend three months in Janda Baik learning about organic and industrial farming as well as composting, ” said association chairman Rashdan Rashid.“They will get further input and training from other farmers in Karak and Jelebu.“Once they have learnt the skills, we will provide them with land to cultivate so that they can earn and become independent, ” he said.He added that the association had plans to hold talks and impart knowledge on sustainable farming to schoolchildren in the future."
"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",,Metro,YEE XIANG YUN,‘Address oversupply by setting up special fund for farmers’,"CASH crop farmers are hoping that the government will allocate dedicated funding to the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (Fama) to address the issue of oversupply during the lockdown.Johor Farmers Movement Association chairman Datuk Mazlan Aliman said that during the first movement control order in March last year, the oversupply of fruits and vegetables had led to wastage and farmers incurred thousands of ringgit in losses.“We anticipate a similar situation with the current lockdown.“Like the last time, we anticipate that buyers will cancel or reduce their orders for perishable goods.“The government should channel a special fund to Fama to purchase the harvested produce and market them in more locations such as rural areas.“This should be done to help farmers, who are considered frontliners in food security, ” he said at a press conference after handing over a memorandum on the matter to Johor Fama director Shahrizan Sudirman.The memorandum calls on the government to review its disaster relief fund for farmers, which presently covers natural events such as floods, to also include losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Mazlan, who represents about 1,000 farmers in Johor, said Fama should set up a 24-hour operations room with a hotline number for farmers to relay their concerns and seek help.This would ensure issues faced by farmers were addressed quickly, he said.He noted that it would be useful for Fama since it was in the midst of updating its database of farmers too.The association also urged Fama to come up with a better pricing mechanism to prevent profiteering.“We received many complaints from farmers who had to sell their harvest of cucumbers, ladies’ fingers, chillies and brinjals at a much lower price to middlemen, who then supplied the items to others according to the market price.“This makes it difficult for farmers to cover their operating costs, ” he said.Mazlan said the association was formed in November last year to improve networking among farmers and with related state authorities.He added that the organisation aimed to have a membership of 10,000."

"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",,Metro,MOHD FARHAAN SHAH,Planting a solution to human-elephant conflict,"THE agricultural community must be roped in if human-elephant conflicts are to be addressed effectively.University of Nottingham in Malaysia’s Management and Ecology of Malaysian Elephants research project principal investigator Dr Wong Ee Phin said there was a need to look at the issue holistically.“These conflicts are complex as elephants are strong and smart and can work out ways to handle any barriers put up to keep them out.“The real issue is the rapid fragmentation of the forest as these animals do not have safe passage to move from one forest patch to another that is away from people and homes, ” she told StarMetro.She said this would jeopardise efforts in mitigating human-elephant conflict as the mammals might wander into villages and residential areas.She pointed out that a lot of important ecological corridors in Johor were almost severed as these areas had been developed.Wong stressed that when forested areas were greatly reduced and the landscape filled with people, this would increase interaction between humans and animals.“If it is not managed carefully, it may result in more conflicts.“However, I do see a way forward but we will need to bring in the agricultural community, including plantation owners and smallholders, to help support elephant conservation, ” she said.Wong said that ultimately, local stakeholders were needed to make it happen.“We need to increase their knowledge of the issue.”She said elephants played an important role in Malaysia’s ecosystem.She described them as “forest planters” as they helped to disperse seeds in the rainforest.“Several tree species rely mainly on large animals to help in seed dispersal, as smaller wildlife will not be able to consume the seeds whole and defecate it in an intact state so that they will be viable for germination.“Other smaller wildlife may eat the flesh of the fruit but when they bite the seed, they will kill it.“Or they move the seeds over short distances, leaving them exposed to diseases near the parent tree, ” she explained.Seeds in elephant dung have a high chance of germination and when the seedlings grow into trees and produce fruit, they will benefit not only wildlife but also indigenous communities, who depend on fruit trees such as wild durian, said Wong.“Elephants are the largest animals on land, so wherever they move, they influence the forest around them.“They can create microhabitats and benefit other wildlife. For example, their dung provides nutrients for insects and vegetation.“When elephants dig the ground for salt licks or for other reasons, they make small ponds filled with rainwater that can be used by frogs and other wildlife, ” she added.On the Johor Elephant Sanctuary (JES), Wong said since it housed state Wildlife and National Parks Department (Perhilitan) staff, they would be able to respond faster to complaints in the area.On May 20, StarMetro reported that the JES in Kota Tinggi was playing an important role in helping to reduce the number of clashes between humans and elephants in the state.Johor Perhilitan director Salman Saaban had said the department received 514 complaints on elephants in the past five years but hoped to halve that number now that JES was operational."

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,,Previous maternal depression can affect the mother-baby bond,"Research led by King’s College London in the United Kingdom has found that women with depression during pregnancy, or with a history of depression, had a reduced quality of mother-infant interaction at both eight weeks and 12 months after their babies were born.The researchers looked at the quality of mother-infant interactions at those two time periods after birth in three groups of 131 women:51 healthy women52 women with clinically-significant depression during pregnancy, and28 women with a lifetime history of depression, but not during pregnancy.At both eight weeks and 12 months, mothers and babies in the depression and history-only groups displayed a reduced quality of interaction.Specifically, at eight weeks, 62% of the group of mothers with depression during pregnancy and 56% of the group of mothers with a history of depression scored in the lowest category of relationship quality, where therapeutic interventions are recommended, compared with 37% in the healthy group.All mother and baby groups improved in their quality of interaction between eight weeks and 12 months, which researchers say indicates that with time, all mothers and their babies can become more attuned to each other.At six days, newborn babies of mothers in the depression and history-only groups had decreased social-interactive behaviour.This, together with maternal socioeconomic difficulties, was also predictive of a reduced quality of interaction, while postnatal depression was not.The relationship between mothers and infants was assessed using the Crittenden Child-Adult Relationship Experimental Index, which assesses “dyadic synchrony” – a term that describes the quality of the relationship as a whole.Researchers analysed films of three-minute interactions filmed at eight weeks and 12 months after birth.Mothers played with their babies while researchers scored the relationship based on seven aspects of behaviour:Facial expressionVocal expressionPosition and body contactAffection and arousalTurn-taking contingenciesControl, andChoice of activity.Lead author and King’s College London Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience research associate Dr Rebecca Bind says: “Our findings suggest that perinatal mental health professionals should offer support not only to women with depression during pregnancy, but also to pregnant women with a history of depression, as they may also be at risk of interaction difficulties.“Future research should try to understand why a history of depression, despite a healthy perinatal period, may impact the developing relationship.”Senior author and consultant perinatal psychiatrist Professor Dr Carmine Pariante adds: “We recommend that healthcare professionals provide pregnant women at risk of interaction difficulties with examples of positive caregiving behaviours, and with ways to engage their babies and understand their needs, all of which could be incorporated into parenting and birth classes and health visits.“We also suggest that interventions that can help the mother-infant interaction should be made more widely available, such as video feedback, where a clinician and mother discuss what behaviours work best to engage and comfort the baby, and structured mother-baby activities, such as art and singing groups.“This is especially important because we know that the early years are vital for future mental health and wellbeing.”"

What divorce is she speaking about? I will calm her down.

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",11:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,CHESTER CHIN,"From The Archives: Coliseum Cafe, a slice of Malaysian history for 99 years","News that the 99-year-old Coliseum Cafe is shutting down for good has caused dismay amongst Malaysian foodies and historians alike. This 2014 story by our Travel writer Chester Chin perfectly encapsulates just why it is such a huge loss to our country's heritage.This story originally appeared in StarLifestyle on 31 August 2014, and has been edited for brevity and clarity.The sconce on the stained wall at the back of Coliseum Café’s dining area hasn’t lit up for a while now. But the lamp’s faulty nature isn’t reason enough to warrant a brand new replacement - not when the item in question is a relic that’s almost a century old.The Western colonial-themed restaurant has been operating since 1921 and in many ways, its dated interior mirrors just that. Antiquated furniture adorns the old mosaic tiled floor, accentuating nostalgia in this quaint venue along the bustling Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman in Kuala Lumpur.At one point during our conversation, the restaurant’s operation manager Jufri Kenneth Abdullah lifts up the tablecloth to reveal the aged wooden surface of the table we are seated at.“For your information, this is 100 years old. This is the same table used back in the restaurant’s early days, ” he reveals, “and so is that coat hanger, ceiling fan and bar top.”He adds that the bar section of the restaurant - once off-limits to the fairer sex - resembles the original arrangements in the 1950s. Framed advertisements from the 1920s and 1930s still hang above the area today.The reason for preserving the café the way it was is history, he says.It’s an incredibly practical logic when you consider that Coliseum Café has weathered many significant milestones in the country.The restaurant stood tall throughout the British colonial rule, the Japanese occupation, Malaya’s independence, the formation of Malaysia and, if you want to put things in a more modern context, the millennium.“In the early days, Coliseum was more of an exclusive dining place. You had to be in proper attire - coat and tie - to dine in. These days, people can just come in shorts and T-shirts, ” Jufri Kenneth says.According to him, the restaurant used to be a favourite haunt among the British colonial crowd when it first opened. By the 1950s, planters and tin miners reportedly gathered on Friday evenings to discuss anti-communist strategies.“Today, we place ourselves as a casual family dining restaurant, ” stresses Jufri Kenneth.Coliseum Café has withstood the test of time. In 2013, the restaurant opened its second outlet at Plaza 33 in Petaling Jaya and was recognised by the Malaysia Book of Records as the “Longest Operating Western Colonial-Themed Restaurant”. They also added a third outlet at Mid Valley Megamall in Kuala Lumpur. In 2014, the venue celebrated its 93rd anniversary in the local culinary scene.Reportedly started by a group of business partners from Hainan Island in China, the restaurant has seen its fair share of famous diners, including the first Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.Acclaimed cartoonist Datuk Mohammad Nor Khalid, endearingly known as Lat, even left behind caricatures of customers who have dined at the venue.Of course, the food is a big part of the draw.“What you see here are all retained from the past, ” Jufri Kenneth says of the menu.The perennial favourites, he says, are the baked crabmeat, homemade oxtail soup, Hainanese fried noodles and “anything that has to do with sizzling”. Of course, one can’t possibly disregard the Hainanese chicken chop - an aspect that’s as ubiquitous as the old Hainanese cooks who prepared them in the past.Although it primarily catered to the British when it first opened, Jufri Kenneth is an ardent believer in Coliseum Café being a thoroughly Malaysian restaurant today.“The Hainanese brought their own style of cooking, the Indians brought the spices and some Malay cooking influences make the food served here Malaysian cuisine.“Dining at Coliseum is actually a walk down memory lane. My father used to bring me here when I was a boy. Back then, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman was known as Batu Road and it was a two-way street.After a brief pause, he adds: “I bring my kids here and eventually, I’m sure they will bring theirs too.”"

In fact, it's gearing up for summer to bring a touch of vibrant graphic style to homes in need of some sunshine.If you think that pottery and ceramics are old hat, then think again. In fact, much to your granny's delight, they're coming back into fashion.Since the 1990s, and the famous steamy scene in Ghost where Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze work clay on the wheel, pottery was forgotten... before making its comeback. In fact, this fine material, which is sculpted and baked, is of keen interest to designers, who have given the medium a new lease of life.Ceramics with flairPottery often brings to mind muted tones like beige and white.

Can I give them juice and sports drinks instead?Along with milk, plain water is the best drink choice for kids.It’s super healthy, with zero calories and no added sugar.It helps keep joints, bones and teeth healthy, helps the blood circulate, and can help kids maintain a healthy weight into adulthood.Being well-hydrated improves mood, memory and attention in children.And of course, tap water is much less expensive than sports drinks, soft drinks and juice.Water doesn’t have to be boring!There are plenty of ways to entice everyone in the family to drink healthy and stay hydrated throughout the day.Being a good role model is a great way to help make water part of your children’s routine and get them in the habit of drinking water before they’re thirsty.Here are a few twists to add some fun:Infuse water with lemons, berries, cucumber or mint for some added flavour.This is an easy way to keep the whole family coming back for refills.Keep fruits and vegetables that are high in water content handy.Some of the best vegetables are cucumber, zucchini, iceberg lettuce, celery and tomato.Top fruits include watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberries, blueberries and grapefruit.Freeze fruit in ice cubes to make your drinks more fun.Young children can help fill the trays.Delight kids with special water bottles or cups.Whether it is a personalised sports bottle or a fancy cup with an umbrella or swirly straw, adding a festive touch can make a difference.Make your own popsicles with pureed fruit for an afternoon cooldown.Make it a fun family activity by using small paper cups and letting your kids decorate them, or find popsicle moulds in fun shapes and colours.Water and milk are all the drinks kids need, so don’t believe all the hype surrounding many of the other drinks marketed to kids.These usually contain way more sugar than children need in a day and can contribute to poor health.Here’s what to avoid:> Sugary drinksMake a rule that no sugar-sweetened beverages are allowed for children who are younger than two years.And try to limit them for your older children as much as possible.This includes sports drinks, juice cocktails, soft drinks, lemonade and sweetened water.These drinks discourage a habit of drinking plain water and can add extra empty calories to the diet.They can also leave your kids less hungry for the nutritious foods they really need.Added sugars can lead to excess weight gain, cavities, diabetes and more.> JuiceEven 100% juice should be strictly limited.While it can contain some vitamins, these drinks are high in sugar and calories, and low in the healthy fibre found in whole fruit.Because of its sweet taste, once children are offered juice, it can be difficult to get them to drink plain water.> Flavoured milkAlthough it has calcium and vitamins, flavoured milk can be much higher in sugar.These added sugars should be avoided to discourage a preference for sweet flavours, which can make it difficult when offering regular milk.> Drinks containing stevia or artificial sweetenersBecause health risks for children from stevia and artificial sweeteners are not well understood, it is best to avoid these drinks.Instead, make water readily available to encourage healthy hydration.Many parents ask how much liquid kids need.At about six months, babies can be introduced to water.They only need about four to eight ounces (118 to 237ml) per day until they are a year old because the rest of their liquids are coming from breast milk or formula.To stay well hydrated, children ages one to three years need approximately four cups of beverages per day, including water or milk.This increases to around five cups for kids aged four to eight, and seven to eight cups for older children.These amounts vary by individual and may need to be adjusted, depending on levels of activity, and heat and humidity outdoors. – By Dr Janine Rethy/American Academy of Pediatrics/Tribune News ServiceDr Janine Rethy is the Community Paediatrics Division chief at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in the United States and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics."

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",3:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,RAFIQUE SHER MOHAMED,Heart and Soul: Growing up with my brother,"My brother Abdul Aziz was born on May 20,1947, and was a year older than me. We were both born in Kampar, Perak, after the war.A couple of months after he was born, father was involved in a shooting incident but escaped unhurt. Many attributed father's good luck to the birth of his son.He was affectionately nicknamed Tan, a name that was never forgotten, even after he grew out of it, by those who had loved him as a kid. I have no clue as to its origin (perhaps he often uttered ""tan, tan, tan"" as a toddler). It was always amusing that those who remembered, continued to call us by our nicknames even when we were no longer children. Such are the bonds of endearment.I can't recall much of our early childhood except from photos of us as toddlers. He was the cuter-looking one in the pictures.Aziz was bright and intelligent. While in Wellesley Primary School Penang, he got a double promotion. He also joined the Scout movement in school and wore his uniform proudly.He was an avid reader, particularly of Western (cowboy) novels by Zane Grey and Louis L'Amour, and the Perry Mason series by Erle Stanley Gardner. He had a big collection of books. I did not share his interest in novels although I admired the book covers, especially the cowboy versions. We, however, had similar interests in movies and comics ; we were both fans of The Phantom.He maintained records of all the movies that he had seen and rated them from his point of view, providing commentaries to justify his impressions. He also had a collection of song books with the lyrics written in his own neat handwriting. His friends would call to request for the lyrics. When Hindustani movies began to get popular with the masses, he became a hardcore fan of Dev Anand, and sparks would fly whenever we said Elvis was better looking. I wondered if he thought that he had a resemblance to his idol.While I struggled through primary and secondary school, Aziz sailed through it with flying colours. Father would have preferred Aziz to pursue studies in the science stream so he could take up medical studies, but he was adamant on non-science subjects. He completed his Senior Cambridge and Higher School Certificate in Kuala Lumpur at Victoria Institution during its heyday when its reputation demanded that only the cream of the crop were enrolled. Aziz then went on to pursue his Bachelor of Economics Degree in the University of Malaya, graduating with Upper Honours in 1970.With his good academic achievement, he was quickly employed as an executive with Guthrie, a reputable British plantation company.To establish his hotshot image, he surprised everyone when he got his first car: a small two-seater sports car, the MG Midget – never mind that he was almost 6-foot tall! But the car provided Aziz with bundles of fun... and girls.He moved on, pursuing a professional qualification from the Institute of Charted Secretaries & Administrators and held top positions, at a relatively young age, in the insurance industry, specialising in general insurance at companies like QBE, Universal Life & General Insurance, and finally General Accident.With each new job and accompanying perks came a big company car as well. I was still riding a hand-me-down scooter, a Lambretta, during that time. He had gone far, quickly in his career and I was still trying to find a place in this world.Penang tops the list of unforgettable memories with Aziz because that's where the family headed for our holidays, all of us squeezed into one car and fighting for the window seats. The thrills we had during the ferry crossings, running down the slopes of the Botanical Gardens imitating airplanes and frolicking in its clear streams, visits to the Gurney Drive promenade and the beaches of Batu Ferringhi, will remain etched in my memory forever.The cherry on the cake while in Penang was staying with friends at the Police HQ. Its strategic location in the centre of George Town enabled us to just get out and explore the surroundings. Our favourite haunt was the Cathay Theatre across the road. For a few cents, we would watch the matinee. Whenever there was a midnight show, Aziz would collect money from us to purchase the tickets. We would all wait for the elders to go to sleep before sneaking out of the house.Being older, Aziz had a knack of getting us to run all his errands, including sending messages to his admiring damsels in waiting. Maybe it was this irritating habit that often got us squabbling and exchanging blows; once the fight got so bad that all my sisters started crying.We shared the same room for many years and had great times with relatives and friends who stayed overnight. I, however, had better chemistry with my eldest brother since Aziz was very attached to his friends so our interactions were considerably reduced.With the introduction of TV into our lives in the 60s, we were entertained to all the great black and white programmes, including The Baron, Man In The Suitcase, Danger Man and the unforgettable westerns, with The High Chaparral topping the list. How we laughed till we cried during the hilarious The Jack Benny Show.When it came to music, Aziz listened to pop and what was on top of the charts, including Dr Hook & the Medicine Show, Kenny Rogers and the First Edition, and Olivia Newton-John.Aziz had no interest in physical fitness activities with his brothers. But, after he graduated, he was active in the Hash House Harriers with his friends.Things began to take a drastic turn in my brother's life in the late 1980s. He was hooked to a working social lifestyle that eventually began to take a toll on his health, work and relationships. His world started to crumble, from which he was never able to recover. He was unable to fight the demons within him and found no reason to move forward. We tried to help him and to give him hope. Mother's love, patience and tender loving care kept him going.He was not flexible, unable to change his ways and not able to make adjustments.When he hit rock bottom, his friends and those he loved abandoned him. Still he hung on to life, a shadow of his former self. His health deteriorated over the years. Finally, on April 23, during the blessed month of Ramadan and on a Friday, my beloved brother passed away.May Allah SWT have mercy on his soul and may he rest in peace. Ameen."

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",1:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,DR SII SIK LIONG,Don't forget to take care of your neck,"You have your daily skincare routine for your face down to a science, and you never leave your house without your sunscreen and moisturiser.But do you pay attention to your neck?In terms of looks, the neck often gives away your age, even before eye wrinkles appear.This is because the skin of the neck is much thinner than facial skin, but is exposed to the same wear and tear every day.Over time, the skin loses collagen and elastin.Combined with environmental factors such as sun damage and smoking, neck skin typically ages quicker than facial skin.Fortunately, there are ways to prevent neck skin ageing.> Protection from the sunIf you are too busy to care about performing skincare routines for your neck, then at least apply sunscreen on it.Ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun cause major damage to your skin and accelerates skin ageing significantly.It increases skin pigmentation, wrinkles and skin DNA damage, while reducing skin elasticity.The single best thing you can do to maintain a youthful neck is to wear sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30, regardless of whether you are spending the day indoors or outdoors.Avoid unnecessary prolonged or excessive exposure to the sun.> Quality skin careWhile there are dedicated neck creams on the market, they are not strictly necessary.Face moisturisers are usually as good as these neck creams, which do not offer any additional benefits unless they contain retinoids.A general rule of thumb is that whatever skincare products you apply on your face can often be applied on your neck as well.Take care of your neck skin just like how you would take care of your facial skin.Retinoids – an ingredient that includes retinol, retinyl palmitate and retinoic acid – can help repair skin damage caused by UV rays.Adding a retinoid to neck skincare helps reduce wrinkles and improves skin texture and skin tone.It helps accelerate skin cell turnover, improves collagen production in the skin and reduces skin pigmentation.> Healthy lifestyleA well-balanced diet and regular exercise will improve your overall health, as well as your skin quality, and delay skin ageing.Avoid consuming a diet high in carbohydrates and fats.Keep your body well-hydrated throughout the day.Regular exercise improves blood circulation, which provides essential nutrients to the skin effectively.Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol.Recreational drug use, which is illegal, is also known to accelerate skin ageing.> Dump bad habitsDid you know that constantly looking at your mobile phone can accelerate the formation of horizontal neck wrinkles and make your neck look older?We often hold our mobile phone lower than our eye level, thereby bending our neck downwards and creating neck wrinkles.Over time, these wrinkles may become deep permanent horizontal lines, just like a piece of paper can form permanent creases when it remains folded.Overuse of perfume on the neck can also age your neck skin.Perfume often contains alcohol and aromatisers that dry your skin quickly.Dry skin is more prone to ageing and wrinkle formation.Avoid daily usage of perfume on your neck and keep your neck skin moisturised at all times.> Embrace technologyThere is only so much we can do to delay neck skin ageing.Often, advanced skin ageing such as sagging skin, can only be treated with the help of medical technologies.There are many non-surgical medical treatments that can improve neck skin.Medical treatments such as ultrasound lifting and radio frequency tightening can help improve neck skin sagging and wrinkling.These treatments use controlled energy to heat up specific layers of the skin and boost the production of collagen and essential proteins.By doing so, they can produce skin lifting and tightening.Laser treatments such as skin resurfacing laser and pigmentation laser may be useful in improving neck skin texture, skin irregularities, fine lines and pigmentation.If you are comfortable with needles, skin hydration injection treatments such as hyaluronic acid injections, can effectively provide intense hydration to the skin to improve skin elasticity and fine lines.Do not neglect your neck. Take care of your neck skin just like you would with your facial skin, and allow it to age gracefully!Dr Sii Sik Liong is a physician practising aesthetic medicine in Singapore.

His boss transferred him to take on a new job position in Kota Kinabalu.I was shocked and surprised by the unexpected news. My parents began discussions that lasted till midnight. However, I only heard that my little sister would stay with my grandparents for some time until my parents could find a good child care centre for her.The days passed by quickly.

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",12:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Global warming blamed for 1 in 3 heat-related deaths,"More than a third of summer heat-related fatalities are due to climate change, researchers said recently, warning of even higher death tolls as global temperatures climb.Previous research on how climate change affects human health has mostly projected future risks from heatwaves, droughts, wild fires and other extreme events made worse by global warming.How much worse depends on how quickly humanity curbs carbon emissions, which hit record levels in 2019 but dipped sharply during the pandemic.But a new study by an international team of 70 experts is one of the first – and the largest – to look at health consequences that have already happened, the authors said.The findings, published in Nature Climate Change, were stark: data from 732 locations in 43 countries spread across every inhabited continent revealed that, on average, 37% of all heat-related deaths can be attributed directly to global warming.""Climate change is not something in the distant future,"" senior author Antonio Gasparrini, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told AFP.""We can already measure negative impacts on health, in addition to the known environmental and ecological effects.""The authors said their methods – if extended worldwide – would add up to more than 100,000 heat-related deaths per year laid squarely at the feet of manmade climate change.Differences across countriesThat number could be an underestimate because two of the regions for which data was largely missing – South Asia and Central Africa – are known to be especially vulnerable to extreme heat deaths.The 100,000 figure is consistent with a recent analysis from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluations (IHME), published in The Lancet.The IHME calculated just over 300,000 heat-related deaths worldwide from all causes in 2019. If just over a third of those deaths are due to climate change, as Gasparrini's team reported, the global total would indeed be more than 100,000.India accounted for more than a third of the total in the IHME tally, and four of the five worst-hit countries were in South Asia and Central Africa.The share of heat-related deaths attributable to global warming in the new study varied widely from country to country.In the United States, Australia, France, Britain and Spain, for example, that percentage was roughly in line with the average across all countries, between 35% and 39%.For Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, Vietnam and Chile, the figure rose above 40%.And for half-a-dozen countries – Brazil, Peru, Colombia, the Philippines, Kuwait and Guatemala – the percentage of heat-related mortality caused by climate change was 60% or more.A complex methodology combining health data and temperature records from 1991 to 2018, coupled with climate modelling, allowed researchers to contrast the actual number of heat-related deaths with how many fewer deaths there would have been without manmade warming.Adapt or dieThe researchers found that it is not the increase in average summer temperature – up 1.5°C since 1991 in the locations examined – that boosted death rates, but heatwaves: how long they last, night-time temperatures, and humidity levels.Also crucial is the ability of the population to adapt.If 95% of the population has air-conditioning, mortality will be lower. But if they don't, or if farmers must work outside in 45°C (113°F) heat to feed their families, the impacts can be catastrophic.Even wealthy nations remain vulnerable: in 2003, a relentless heatwave in western Europe claimed 70,000 lives.Deadly heatwaves that might have occurred once a century before climate change kicked in could, by mid-century, happen far more frequently, scientists warn.The burgeoning field of attribution climate science measures by how much, for example, a typhoon's intensity, a drought's duration, or a storm surge's destruction has been amplified by global warming.But little research has tried to do the same for human health, notes Dan Mitchell, a researcher at the Cabot Institute for the Environment at the University of Bristol.""This shift in thinking is essential... so that global leaders can understand the risks,"" he said in a comment in Nature Climate Change. – AFP Relaxnews"
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",11:20 AM MYT,Lifestyle,DINESH KUMAR MAGANATHAN,Malaysian actor shares timely climate change message in this virtual theatre show,"Veteran theatre actor Sukania Venugopal misses the performance stage and a live audience. But if this pandemic era has taught her anything, it’s to keep moving forward.In her latest work with Singapore theatre company The Necessary Stage (TNS) called The Year Of No Return, Sukania ""appears"" on stage virtually.“It was an interesting challenge to work online. I was guided through vocal instructions from Singapore through Zoom by Alvin Tan, Haresh Sharma and the Singapore team in shaping and offering my performance, ” says Sukania, referring to the play’s director and playwright respectively.“I welcomed and embraced the challenge just for the experience. It's just a matter of accepting the situation and going along with it, and it was curiously a pleasant experience, ” adds Sukania, who was last seen in the Kuala Lumpur Performing Arts Centre’s online show Unity (1918).The Year Of No Return, which is part of the Singapore International Festival Of Arts (SIFA), will stream on the festival’s On-Demand platform starting today (June 5), just in time for World Environment Day.For her part as Dr Maya Balan, a marine biologist, Sukania was filmed in a studio in KL and it was then pieced together by the TNS team.“Work as such is not affected. I just have to work along with the conditions that require me to adjust with the situation that we are facing at the moment, ” says the award-winning actor.This ticketed show, which runs for 90 minutes, was staged physically at the Victoria Theatre on May 21 and 22 as part of the annual arts festival. The On-Demand series, which will run until June 20, features 24 programmes.The Year Of No Return, which also features Chihiro Hirai, Tan Guo Lian Sutton, Siti Khalijah Zainal, Marco Viana and Rodolfo Vera (who’s also the playwright), will be performed in English, Japanese, Malay and Tagalog with English surtitles.This hybrid production, which seeks to unravel the complications and contradictions in humanity’s responses to climate change, incorporates live performance and video presentations.The Year Of No Return centres around a global climate forum that takes place in Singapore while a protest rages outside.The play asks pertinent questions in the face of a climate crisis: Can we as individuals, and collectively, affect change? Or will politics and profit dictate the fate of this planet—our only home?KL-based Sukania recalls the play’s two-phase creation process, which began in 2019, where the entire team met up at TNS.“We explored various narratives, characters and so on, as a way of grappling with the issue of the climate catastrophe, ” she says.It was this collaborative groundwork - pre-pandemic - that made the process of shifting parts of the show onto the virtual space easier.“These were really valuable as we had the opportunity to collaborate in person, and to discuss the issues to be explored.“Because we could work in person in these phases, I believe it helped us when we had to shift gears and do rehearsals online for the final phase, ” says Sukania, adding that she tries to remain positive during these lockdown days.She reminds herself that things will take a turn for the better at some point.""I do miss travelling to a new space and working physically with actors but am confident it will happen as this situation will pass.“I’m also very heartened by the response of the arts community to rise above the challenges of Covid-19. To me, it reflects our resilience and hope for the future.”Ultimately, Sukania feels that the performing arts community needs to rally together and help one another as much as everybody can during this period.“I also hope that audience members and donors empathise with our situation, and where possible, continue their support for the arts by donating to theatres and companies, to help keep us afloat until such time we can return to the live stage, ” says Sukania.More details: SIFA."

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,MING TEOH,Baby photographer makes healthy snacks to sell during pandemic,"When the pandemic first started last year, baby and family photographer Asther Lau did not expect things to get so bad.“I thought that if I was careful and had strict SOPs in place, I could still service my clients,” says Lau, a Sarawakian who lives in Petaling Jaya.“Even though it wasn’t possible to do my shoots outdoors, I could still do them in the comfort and safety of my studio,” she recounts.“But when the situation got worse and the number of cases increased, my studio’s building management disallowed visitors altogether,” she says.Lau reveals that she still had enquiries for maternity and newborn sessions throughout the recovery and conditional MCOs although the numbers had dropped drastically from pre-pandemic days.“But I had to be selective,” she says.Her family’s health and safety was a major concern and priority.“My mum has lupus, my husband has hypertension and irregular heartbeat episodes, and my daughter is just 12. I myself am a thyroid patient. So, we’re kind of in the high-risk category and can’t afford to succumb to what was then the unknown Covid disease,” she says.Lau, who has been in the photography business for 13 years, reveals that she was only able to earn a total of two months worth of her usual income last year.Her household income was also impacted since her husband, who runs a handyman business, couldn’t go to clients’ homes during the pandemic.Lau knew she had to pivot. She decided to start selling homemade food, including Sarawak specialities cooked by her mother, in their neighbourhood.“It was a huge hit with our neighbours and we could at least bear our daily expenses through the earnings. But it was a lot of hard work,” she says.Lau even started baking and selling buttermilk cookies and banana cake in her neighbourhood.But the profit margin was too low to survive on, she says.Because she was involved in helping to rescue and rehome stray animals in the neighbourhood, Lau got to know many pet owners. She decided to try making pet snacks and food – dehydrated pet treats, home baked pet cookies – to sell, and bought a dehydrator.But she discovered that there were already so many new players in the pet food business and realised it was not a feasible option, so she was stuck with the equipment she had bought and no business plan.Incidental discoveryLau says that what she sells was an “incidental discovery” and that she “underestimated” it at first, because it was “just something that she and her family consume personally”.“I decided to use the dehydrator to make dehydrated fruits for my family since I’ve always loved eating dried fruit and it’s difficult to find good quality ones with no preservatives,” she says.“I used to have to drive around a lot, fetching my daughter for classes and didn’t get to have my meals on time, and I kept a bottle of my dried fruit snacks in the car which I tried and realised they were so good, and healthy too!” she laughs.“They’re a great pick-me-up, especially during stressful days,” she says. “And I suddenly realised that it was a business idea worth exploring.”It was in November 2020 and she decided to make the most of the Christmas season and start selling dehydrated fruit treats in Christmas packaging as gifts.Since she was also very much into recycling at home, Lau decided to use glass jars because there aren’t many recycling centres that accept them, unlike paper, plastic or aluminum cans.She started by cleaning and sterilising her own huge collection of empty jars at home, decorated them with a Christmas theme and filled them with the dehydrated fruits and once again started selling them in her neighbourhood.The feedback from her neighbours was very encouraging.“Feeling motivated, I worked at making better treats, tweaking the size and shape for better production quality,” she says.From a self-designed logo, she decided to invest into her branding and hired a professional designer to produce her logo and labels.In January 2021, she officially launched Jari Treats. Her treats include cinnamon apples, gingery oranges, dehydrated mangoes and dehydrated pineapples, but there are seasonable fruits such as persimmons as well. She is currently doing R&D and hopes to have more products in the future, including vegetables and other seasonal fruits too.Lau says that her treats appeal to a wide target market – from energetic millennials who are constantly on-the-go and need snacks to keep their energy levels up, to homemakers looking for healthy snacks for their family, to those seeking thoughtful, healthy gifts for their loved ones whom they can’t see during the pandemic.Most of her customers are from the Klang Valley but some have ordered her treats to be sent out to as far as Penang and Johor, which she uses a delivery service for.A family affairWhile Lau does most of the production work personally, her mother and daughter help to prepare the fruits, slicing and washing them, and her husband helps with deliveries as well as purchasing the crates of fruit.She admits that there are many challenges starting a new business during the pandemic.“Food is a very fast-paced and trending industry. There needs to be consistent marketing in order to maintain the sales,” she says.She is also concerned about the current lockdown and how it will impact her family and business.“We’re worried and not sure if we can cover our overheads,” she says.“On one hand, more people tend to want to send gifts to their loved ones whom they can’t meet or visit. On the other hand, people spend more cautiously during uncertain times, while the cost of raw materials and operations are constantly increasing, so the product pricing has to be just right,” she says, adding that she’s gotten certification from the Health Ministry and a typhoid jab which is a requirement in the food-handling industry.Lau has also recently signed a lease to a bigger workspace in a commercial lot.“It’s not a shop but a bigger space with a larger kitchen and more packing and storage space. We hope to be able to increase our production and sales,” she says.“Eating healthy is now the trend, even more so during the pandemic.“Rather than having snacks that are processed with lots of sugar, salt, artificial flavouring and preservatives, I hope to encourage people to have healthy snacks with no artificial flavouring, preservatives, and no added salt or sugar,” she concludes."

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,World Environment Day: Pakistan and its 'tree tsunami' project in the spotlight,"The 2021 edition of the UN-organised World Environment Day will be held today (June 5). This year, Pakistan is in the spotlight. In 2019, the South Asian country launched one of the largest reforestation projects in the world.Ten billion trees planted by 2023. This is the ambitious project of the ""Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Programme"", launched in 2019 by the Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan. The first phase aims to plant 3.25 billion trees in the country, at an estimated cost of about Rs105bil (RM2.8bil). The programme also aims to preserve mangroves (an ecosystem of trees along the coastline), reforest cities and create more than 5,500 ""green"" jobs.This reforestation project is part of a similar approach to the ""Billion Tree Tsunami"" launched in 2014 by the previous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, which aimed to plant one billion trees across the country.Meanwhile another WWF Pakistan-supported project launched in 2018 has planted nearly 1.6 million trees, native species in the country, in different cities of Pakistan, along with about a billion native plants.A country at high risk of deforestationAccording to the Global Climate Risk Index 2021, Pakistan ranks eighth among countries most affected by climate change between 1999 and 2019, with economic losses equivalent to US$3.772bil (RM15.55bil).Extreme heat waves, high humidity, flooding... Pakistan is directly affected by the melting of Himalayan glaciers, which is responsible for severe water shortages in much of the country, as well as the gradual disappearance of riparian forests.In fact, its annual deforestation rate is considered one of the highest in the world. Between 2000 and 2010, the country lost an average of 43,000ha of forest per year, about half the area of its capital Islamabad.Its forest currently covers about 4.478 million hectares (5.1%), according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This is a very small share when you consider that the world's forest cover is 4.06 billion hectares (about 31% of the total land area).Today's World Environment Day will also mark the opening of the United Nations Decade on Ecosystems Restoration 2021-2030. The year 2030 as a deadline was not picked randomly: it corresponds to the deadline set by scientists to avoid the amplification of the effects of climate change.""2020 was a year of reckoning, facing multiple crises, including a global pandemic and the continued crises of climate, nature and pollution. In 2021, we must take deliberate steps to move from crisis to healing: and in so doing, we must recognise that the restoration of nature is imperative to the survival of our planet and the human race,"" outlined Inger Andersen, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme. – AFP Relaxnews"

She would be making her acting debut in a leading role.John Wick franchise started in 2014 as a low-budget action movie. It centres on a retired hitman who gets back to killing mode after a two-bit baddie steals his car and kills his dog.It became a huge hit and kickstarted a successful franchise – two hit sequels, this upcoming chapter four and a green-lit fifth movie.In the works too are a spin-off TV show, The Continental, which will be set in the 1970s, and a spin-off film about a female assassin titled Ballerina."
"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",8:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,MICHAEL CHEANG,"Tipsy-Turvy: What is a cocktail shaker, and other tools of the bartending trade?","Well, here we are, stuck at home again. I guess it’s back to making drinks at home again, huh?Well, since we’ve already covered what sorts of spirits, liqueurs, and syrups you should have in your home bar, let us now talk about the sort of tools you need to recreate your favourite cocktails at home.Now, before we get into the sorts of bar tools that are out there, it should be pointed out that you don’t HAVE to get these tools for your home, as there are plenty of utensils in your kitchen that can be used for the same purpose. For instance, a cookie jar can be used as a cocktail shaker, baking measuring spoons can replace jiggers, a chopstick can stir a drink just as well as a fancy bar spoon... well, you get the picture.However, while these replacements will get your drink made, they don’t offer the same experience as using some proper bar tools.“We feel that having the right tools will give you more joy and better results in what you are making, ” says Nathan Pinto, co-founder of The 4 Barmen, a Malaysian startup that specialises in making good quality and affordable bar tools.“Sure, you can mix cocktails using a water jug at home, however, with a proper cocktail shaker, you have better control when mixing and shaking drinks with finesse.“Working with ‘make-do’ tools will get the job done, but using proper tools, the whole experience will be exceptionally better and becomes more fun. The results also taste and look better, ” Pinto adds.The 4 Barmen was formed when the four founders – who are cocktail enthusiasts, but not professional bartenders – realised that the options for bar tools in the Malaysian market were limited. Hence, they decided to take matters into their own hands and set up a store offering high quality bar tools and glassware at a reasonable price, with more elegant finishes, in order to inspire Malaysians to create more cocktails at home. Their store includes three levels of Starter kits suitable for home bartenders, depending on the skill level of the user.With that in mind, let’s learn about the different sorts of bartools and what they are used for, with some help from bartender Shawn Chong of the Mizukami Collective and Bar Class Academy Asia.ShakerThe primary function of a shaker is to mix, chill, aerate, and dilute a cocktail. There are two main types of shakers that are commonly used in bars – the Cobbler and the Boston.The main difference between the two is obviously the shape and size. Also known as a three-piece shaker, the Cobbler is the one that looks like a little metal bottle, while the larger Boston shaker is commonly made up of two large vessels, usually made of metal, though some are a combination of metal and glass vessels.“A Cobbler shaker generally fits one or two drinks depending on volume, while a Boston can accommodate three to four, ” Chong says.“The Boston shaker is also more efficient in making drinks that have solid items like fruit, herbs and spices as well as well drinks that call for cream or dairy. The space in the shaker eases the frothing capability.”According to him, the Boston shaker is also more versatile as open vessels are easier and faster to clean, so a Boston Shaker wins on hygiene.The cobbler shaker, on the other hand, has an in-built strainer at the top and so is favourable for cocktails that don't call for any fresh herbs, purees or pulp.JiggerWith a distinctive hourglass shape, the jigger is a bartenders' measuring tool.“Just like baking, accuracy is required to create balanced cocktails by respecting the proportions a recipe calls for. It's far faster and more efficient than using a scale, though a scale would win at point accuracy, ” says Chong.Mixing GlassA mixing glass is used to stir a cocktail rather than shake it, as this allows you to maintain better control over the amount of dilution, and also maintain the texture and viscosity of the drink better.Sure, you can just use a normal glass or a jar to mix drinks, but many bartenders tend to use specially crafted mixing glasses. This is not just for the aesthetics – some professional mixing glasses, like the Yarai mixing glass (named after the Japanese diamond pattern etched on the outside) are made with a heavy base, uses thicker glass, has a spout at the top for easy pouring, and the pattern at the side makes it easier to hold while using.Bar spoonA spoon is just a spoon, right? Well, not when it’s a bar spoon. “While its primary function is for stirring cocktails, It can also be used to measure smaller quantities instead of using a jigger, as a bar spoon usually measures three to four millilitres of liquid, ” says Chong.A bar spoon can also be used for layering spirits on top of one another, either by pouring the spirit over the underside of the spoon, or by using the spiral stem.Some bar spoons also either come with a fork on the other end (which can be used for skewering garnishes or squeezing citrus directly from fruit wedges), or a muddler. Which brings us to...MuddlerThe muddler is used to crush fruits, herbs or spices to extract its flavour properties. The size of the muddler doesn't matter, though a larger one usually requires less effort.StrainerBartenders commonly use two types of strainers – Hawthorne strainers and conventional mesh strainers.A Hawthorne strainer is usually paired with a Boston shaker to hold muddled items and ice, as the ice shouldn't be reused once a drink is made. It commonly comes with prongs that sit at the lip of the shaker.""A Hawthorne Strainer with no prongs serves the same purpose but is very useful for bartenders to use the ‘throw’ technique,"" says Chong. ""The throw technique allows for a slower dilution rate than shaking and more aeration than stirring yielding a different end result to a cocktail.""According to Chong, most of the time, a normal mesh strainer would be sufficient for straining your drinks, but there are times when you need to ‘fine strain’ it as well.Fine straining means using both a Hawthorne Strainer AND a mesh strainer together in order to effectively remove any smaller particles that a Hawthorne can't hold back. It is also used to ensure a nice smooth froth/foam should the cocktail need it.Bar bladeA bar blade is a bottle opener that's meant for high volume bars where bottled drinks like beer are served a lot, according to Chong.“Its length usually causes the blade protrude from a bartender's pocket for easy access and with a long blade it creates a better fulcrum making it easier to open the caps. The long blade also allows bartenders to do tricks/flair in hopes to earn some tips!” he says.Michael Cheang used to shake cocktails using a plastic cookie jar. Now he has a proper shaker and is not afraid to use it. Follow him on Facebook (fb.com/mytipsyturvy), Instagram (@MyTipsyTurvy) or Twitter (@MichaelCheang)."
"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",8:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,S.H. LOKE,Heart and Soul: Malaysian schoolteacher recounts her experiences with epilepsy,"I grew up as a happy and healthy child. My parents gave me the best of everything. My nanny took care of me until I was 16.There were no signs of fits throughout my childhood. I enjoyed my life and my teaching career.How did I become epileptic? At 40, I had my first seizure. Every evening I climbed a slope, so I overstressed myself. One night at 4am, I had my first seizure. I was convulsing, my muscles stiffened and I bit my tongue. My husband who was terrified called for an ambulance and sent me to the nearest hospital.The next morning, the physician confirmed that I had had an attack of fits. When I woke up, I had a headache. This is a common symptom after a seizure. I was in a daze, and felt mentally disoriented. I could not recall what had happened to me the night before.There was a temporary loss of memory which is another normal sign. I had never seen my son looking so worried before.After one night, I was discharged.There were many questions hanging in my mind. All I was told was that there was a scar in my brain. It could emit electrical impulses.Whenever I had a seizure, there was a ""storm"" inside my brain caused by the firing of these electrical impulses.I was put on medication, and my seizures were well controlled.Subsequently, I had two other attacks in my sleep and one while I was cooking. Those were mild attacks because I recovered quickly.Then for eight years I was free from seizures, and I stopped my medication without consulting my physician. It was a mistake which I regretted because I went through one of the most traumatic experiences in my life.In 2011, I went to Germany for a holiday with my husband. On the night of my return, I had the worst attack of my life. Just before I slept, I shrieked and then fainted. According to my husband, I suffered a series of eight seizures. I was gasping for breath.I was admitted to hospital, and my physician put me under a neurologist. I was put in the High Dependency Unit. My physician explained that flying for 20 hours, and the low oxygen level, had triggered the multiple seizures. Again I lost my memory for a while, and I was confused. Feeling exhausted and weak, I just slept for two days. The MRI showed a scar in my brain.After this, I realised how important it was for me to take my medication in order to control my fits.During a seizure, you struggle to breathe because your muscles go into spasm. It is dangerous for an epileptic person to go swimming alone. If you have an attack, you will drown.My last attack in 2005 was caused by heat and stress. It was very hot when I went to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. This time I had two attacks in two days.My neurologist had me go for a CT scan and an MRI. I had to take a stronger drug together with my usual drug to control my seizures. Initially, it caused weakness and drowsiness.People have asked me whether I know when I am about to get a seizure. I normally shout and then lose consciousness. Some epileptics have an aura before an attack. They smell familiar things like food, or hear familiar sounds.How can we prevent seizures? We should avoid extreme heat and stress, and sleep well. Flashing lights and the changing of television channels quickly are to be avoided. Of course, we should not skip or stop our medication even if we feel well. We cannot take things for granted, especially when our health is concerned. The key to survival is adaptability.I have captured the details of a seizure in this poem titled Suddenness Of A Seizure:Suddenly I let out a distressing shout,Next I was engulfed in a blackout,I slumped forward, with my body convulsing,I could not feel or hear anything,Gasping for breath while I fell,Why I was stiff, I could not tell,I wanted to close my eyes and sleep,I was sinking into an abyss, dark and deep,Feeling so lifeless, exhausted and weak,It was like entering a tunnel, black and bleak,My fatigued mind was in a whirl,Baffling thoughts filled my mind in a swirl,I tried to remember what had happened,So much despair and overwhelming confusion,Then I recognised a voice gentle and kind,He asked me,""Are you feeling fine?"""
"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",7:35 PM MYT,Lifestyle,SHEILA SINGAM,Mother’s Day letter to my daughters,"Dear Stephanie and Joanna,Did you know that long ago, when I was still single, I told myself that I wasn’t going to have children? I thought that bringing up children would be the hardest thing in the world to do and I was right.The thought of having the fate of small human beings in my hand, of having to keep them alive until they could fend for themselves, terrified me. You may not know this from the times I have disciplined you and demanded you follow the rules, but I have always been something of a free spirit. I never liked to be tied down, and there’s nothing like having children to tie one down.Nevertheless, like gazillions of other people across the ages, I did get married and have children. The day I discovered I was expecting you, Stephanie, I almost exploded with a cocktail of emotions of which joy and terror were predominant.My life as I knew it, was over. Goodbye, dancing, partying and freedom; hello nausea, tiredness and responsibility.I had been a diligent student for the most part of secondary school and I had spent five years in university, graduating with a degree and diploma that prepared me to become a teacher.But nowhere in any of the textbooks I read or the research I did, was there anything that prepared me for becoming a mother. You were born after almost a day of labour, not quite kicking and screaming (that was me). I was depleted at the tough job of expelling you, but the minute I set eyes on you, everything I had said and thought about not having children flew out the window.You were the most beautiful, perfect thing I had produced in my life thus far and I felt an immense sense of accomplishment when I beheld you.Of course, in the pethidine- and achievement-induced euphoria, I had no clue of what was in store for me but my maternal instincts kicked in and I felt ready to face the world, influenced by the vision of ideal mothers and perfect babies that only existed in my head!Speaking of maternal instincts, I think that was built into the genetic makeup of women to make sure we stay and nurture the little beings we produce until they marry and go away. Seriously, it’s like an unseen force shield that holds us and our children together for life – mothers can never escape it. Ever.There was no handbook, no training, nothing that prepared me for a baby. When I think of those people who created the Home Science syllabus in school, I want to smack them. I learned how to clean a fish, make perfect pound cakes, sew a skirt, clean stains on clothes and a host of other Pinterest-worthy tasks, but no one thought to teach me how to care for a baby.Considering that the work of bathing, changing, feeding, burping and entertaining children is largely thrust upon mothers, I find our educators have been rather remiss to have omitted this.Anyway, I muddled along with the help of my mother and a host of aunties and cousins who offered advice that veered from being scientifically advanced to old wives’ tales. Often, one had to try many different things before one found the perfect answer – it was like mining for gold in a river bed of sand until you found a shiny nugget.As a trainer and coach today, I am a huge advocate of getting people to practise what they learn on the job. Sometimes, navigating the unknown and learning the hard way can be the best way. I know, because motherhood was my on-the-job training and I could not afford to fail, because the life of a small being lay in my hands.I managed it by the skin of my teeth. I worked as a teacher till two every day while you were at the babysitter’s, Stephanie, and then came home to do a full day’s work cleaning, cooking, washing and looking after you.The only part of that I loved with no complaint was the time spent with you. You became the centre of my life. To get a smile from you, to watch you take your first steps, see you in a beautiful dress became the source of my joy. Here’s a secret – your achievements and your sister’s are still a source of pride and joy to me today.By the time you came, Joanna, I was already an old hand at bringing up children. I could put you on my legs and bathe you the traditional Indian way, and I was lots more confident about how to handle you. Your growing up years were filled with hilarity because you were such a foil for your (then) sweet, well-behaved older sister. Again, I had to adopt a hands-on approach to learning how to handle your feisty little self, so different from your sister, yet just as beautiful.I had to wing it all the way, adopting unorthodox ways to keep you on the kiddies’ straight and narrow. I’m not sure if you remember one of them, which involved biting you to show that you should not bite and draw blood from other children, including your sister. Or sitting you down to explain patiently why you should not take the cane and beat your sister and her friends when they would not play with you, adding the postscript that if you ever did that again, you would be the one tasting the lick of the cane.When your father and I went our separate ways, you both became my purpose. To nurture you, educate you and provide for you, and to ensure you turned into strong women with sound values became the focus of my life – I wanted to be a mother you could be proud of. I think this is what keeps many single mothers going.I know in those years, I had to be more father than mother to you because I had to earn the means to give you a decent life. I am thus ever grateful to my own mother, who imparted values, faith and strength to me through the example of her own life, for taking on the mother role at home.During those years when we were alone, we became a family unit of four strong-minded females who comforted each other, entertained each other and fought together. Even at a young age, you both had compassion and the strength to defend me and fight on my behalf against naysayers and critics.And then came your dad, the man I subsequently married, who became the role model of what a husband and father should be and who added the yang to the overwhelming yin of four women (and a female dog) in the household. We had so many happy years together as he introduced us to a myriad of new experiences that we otherwise might never have had.He taught us to take risks, to be generous, to never worry about mundane things, to aspire to be exceptional women and to live life to the fullest. I suspect, if he hadn’t come into our lives, you and I would never have evolved into the women we are now. It is the greatest tragedy of our lives that he went before his time. I want you to know that you were the ones who kept me moving forward because of your compassion and love.I wish I had known early in life about what a mother should be like but I’d like to think I haven’t done too badly despite the lack of a handbook. We have been through so much that other families cannot even begin to imagine, and it has bound us together with even stronger cords of love.Joanna, whenever I doubt myself as a parent, you have told me that I am the best mother in the world, but then you are delightfully biased when it comes to me. So then I look to you, Stephanie to bring me back to earth by humbly telling me that although I am a bit overbearing at times, I have been a good mother and that you are the living testimony to that. You also told me that all a mother can do is give her best. That brought me a lot of comfort as I write this.As I evaluate my life today, I do think I have done my best as a mother while navigating career changes, divorce, death, betrayal, sustaining a business, dips in the economy, a pandemic of catastrophic proportions and other challenges.I think every mother does the best she can with the resources she has, in the midst of the trials and tests life has thrown at her. And that’s why whether she has been perfect or less than, too rigid or too relaxed, ever-present or not always, she deserves to be celebrated for the effort in the midst of trying to make sense of her own life.Happy Mother’s Day to all mums out there, whether you feel you have been a good one or not. Because believe me, you have been the best version of yourself that you can be.Sheila Singam is the founder of Human Equation, a development consultancy specialising in mindset change and innovation. She has held many different roles in her life and considers motherhood her most fulfilling as she considers its results. The views expressed here are entirely the writer’s own."

"Thursday, 27 May 2021",,Food,IAN LAU - RETRO RECIPE,Discovering ingredients behind Sarawak laksa,"LAKSA is a dish that has a different meaning depending on where you come from.Although by definition laksa is a spicy noodle soup, various states in Malaysia have their own spin on this dish, each offering a different culinary experience.Sarawak laksa became world famous when the late Anthony Bourdain claimed that this “breakfast of the gods” is “one of the foods served in heaven” and featured it twice in his shows --- for Travel Channel’s No Reservations and CNN’s Parts Unknown.I discovered when preparing it that Sarawak’s laksa is distinctive not so much for the combination of herbs and spices in the broth.The biggest difference is how it is thickened not just with coconut milk but with roasted ground sesame seeds and peanuts.This recipe, one of the simpler made-from-scratch Sarawak laksa recipes, was previously published in Flavours magazine, and is stored in the Kuali.com archives.However, even many true-blood Sarawakians are opting for ready-made spice paste because of the many components required before cooking the dish.Do not be intimidated by the number of ingredients though.Some of the roasting and toasting of ingredients can be done ahead of time, and even the broth can be prepared a day before if coconut milk is added just before serving.While laksa from other states are served with either laksa noodles (Penang, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang), wheat noodles with or without rice vermicelli (Perak, Selangor and Melaka), or spaghetti (Johor), Sarawak laksa uses only rice vermicelli.A Sarawak laksa stall at a Chinese coffeeshop in Petaling Jaya uses Sarawak mee kolo noodles and I learned from my colleague Tina Loh from Kuching that this is not the norm.She advised that laksa in Kuching is only served with chicken.Combined with prawns, these two meats provide proteins to enrich the broth and garnish the dish.Some recipes also include sliced fish cake as a topping, which you may add if desired.One topping missing from this recipe, though, is julienne omelette.Loh says the egg is a crucial ingredient and remembers from having helped her mum cook the dish at home.I decided to include it too.Although Loh also insisted on belacan in the sambal condiment, this recipe listed only dried shrimps.I felt that it was essentially the same basic ingredient but in different form, as everyone was wowed by its taste despite the absence of belacan.You may add belacan if you wish.I know that although it may not be viewed as authentic by many Sarawakians, I hope this recipe makes a good tribute to their state dish. Happy Gawai to all.Sarawak laksaSambal10 red chillies2 bulbs red onions1 clove garlic50g dried shrimps8 tbsp cooking oilSpice paste150g small onions125g garlic150g galangal30g red chillies4 stalks lemongrass, white part only10 dried chillies, soaked in hot water for 20 minutes30g candlenuts20g cumin seeds55g coriander seeds3 pods star anise, dry toasted and ground4 buds cloves, dry toasted and ground1 nutmeg kernel, pounded5 pods cardamoms, seeds onlyStock1kg fresh prawns500g chicken breast or pork2 litres cold waterIngredients12 tbsp palm oil75g sesame seeds, toasted and ground150g peanuts, toasted and ground1 tbsp curry powder2 tsp salt to taste2 tbsp sugar1½ litres chicken and prawn stock2 cups coconut milkGarnish00g rice vermicelli, scalded5-6 calamansi limes, halved1 bunch coriander200g beansprouts, scalded1 cucumber, shredded2 eggs, made into an omelette and julienne-cut shredded chicken meat or pork poached prawns sambalMethodTo make the stock, remove the prawn heads and shells.

Set aside.To make the spice paste, blend all the ingredients with a little oil into a fine paste.Heat the oil in a frying pan and saute the spice paste until fragrant, then add sesame seeds, peanuts, curry powder and seasonings.To make the laksa broth, place the spice paste in a large saucepan and add stock and coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat, adding more stock if necessary, to adjust its consistency.To serve, divide the vermicelli among bowls and ladle the broth over it, then garnish and serve piping hot with sambal."

"Tuesday, 25 May 2021",,Food,,Crispy goose for vegetarians,"VEGETARIAN goose got its name not because it tastes like goose meat but because of its crispy texture that resembles the skin of roast goose.It is made completely out of foo pei, or bean curd skin, and is seasoned with a mixture of red fermented bean curd and five spice powder.It is said to have been invented by Buddhist monks in Hangzhou, China, and is one of the first vegetarian dishes that, although having a meat moniker, doesn’t really mimic the real thing – unlike many other mock meats.It is not often prepared at home because not many people like to deep-fry, so it is usually bought ready-made.However, it is not really difficult to make because it only contains a few ingredients, and the oil can be reused for other dishes.The most important step is to keep your packages neat without the raw edges of the bean curd skin breaking into the oil.This is done by folding the edges of the bean curd skin towards the centre until you get a package that has all the raw edges tucked into a narrow rectangle.Then secure the packages with toothpicks so they do not open up when frying.Some recipes give instructions to poke holes into the packages before frying to release the air bubbles.I find this method allows too much oil to penetrate into the folds of the packages, making it crispy all the way inside but very greasy.I prefer to puncture the bubbles as they emerge so that it’s less greasy and still soft inside.Unless you can multitask, I recommend frying the packages one at a time so that the oil temperature doesn’t lower too much and it is easier to handle any erupting bubbles.The vegetarian goose should be consumed immediately although it can stay crispy for a few hours.If left out for too long, it can be made crispy again in a toaster oven at 150°C for 10 minutes, but it should not be fried again.You may serve it as an appetiser with a sweet Thai chilli sauce.Vegetarian gooseIngredients3 sheets bean curd skin3 cups cooking oilsweet chilli sauceMarinade3 cubes red fermented beancurd150ml cold water1½ tsp icing sugar½ tsp light soy sauce½ tsp five spice powderMethodIn a small bowl, break up bean curd cubes with a little water before adding in the remaining water. Add sugar, soy sauce and five spice powder and whisk together until combined.Spread open the bean curd skins and arrange on a countertop.Stack them neatly one on top of the other and cut into quarters with kitchen shears.Take one quarter sheet of bean curd skin and brush the marinade seasoning all over the surface.Place another sheet on top and brush lightly with a layer of marinade.Fold the long ends of the bean curd sheet to meet in the centre, then fold in the sides, making sure that the raw edges are tucked into the inside of the bean curd package.Use toothpicks to secure both ends and one in the centre to hold the piece in place. Then continue to brush and fold remaining sheets until you get six bean curd packages.The final packages should measure about 7x20cm, each consisting of about 16 layers of bean curd skin.Heat oil in a frying pan and deep-fry packages one at a time until golden brown.Use a bamboo skewer to puncture the packages as you fry so that the bubbles do not suddenly burst and splatter oil all over the place.Remove toothpicks after frying, cut into slices and serve immediately with sweet chilli sauce."

"Sunday, 23 May 2021",6:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Young people more likely than boomers to try lab-grown meat,"Steak, rare? Why not, as long as it's grown in-vitro. That's the conclusion of a study published last week regarding attitudes to consuming meat grown in a laboratory.Conducted collaboratively by two American universities and one British, the study, available in the Foods journal, aims to understand the state of mind of different generations facing the emergence of alternative meat production. These in-vitro proteins are made from animal cells and then grown in test tubes. This type of cultivation presents an alternative to traditional breeding whose consequences on the environment are disastrous.The younger the generation, the more in favour of in-vitro meatTo find out more about perceptions of what not long ago seemed like a meal out of a work of science fiction, the researchers interviewed adults of different age groups.The study was conducted on representative samples of the American and British populations. And appetites vary depending on the generation. About 89% of GenZers are inclined to consume it and have a positive view of the subject. A similar percentage is found among millennials (85%).Boomers, on the other hand, are less open, with just 77% ""at least somewhat open"" to trying lab-raised meat.In vitro meat vs farmed meatOn average, those who took part in the study said that this new type of protein could make up 37-42% of their diet's meat in the future.Generally, answers suggested that many expected farmed meat to remain on their plates and that this new form of protein would make up a ""partial, rather than full, replacement for meat"".In their study, the researchers found that ""despite growing evidence of the environmental and public health threats posed by today's intensive animal production, consumers in the west remain largely attached to meat.""It is therefore difficult to predict whether this type of meat will become widespread. It will be necessary above all to convince a public that has been fed on farmed meat, although it may become easier as younger generations become purchasers for their households. – AFP Relaxnews"

"Friday, 21 May 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,International Tea Day: Climate change may be changing the taste of tea,"Climate change is threatening our tea consumption. A recent report shows that extreme weather conditions are likely to alter the taste of the world's most widely consumed beverage. By 2050, a quarter of the tea plants in India and Kenya could have disappeared.Wine, rice, chocolate, coffee, etc. The list of foods threatened by global warming is long. And now we can add tea to it. Floods, heat waves, hurricanes... these meteorological events are becoming increasingly frequent due to climate change and threatening tea growing areas in the world.This is particularly the case in Kenya, the world's largest exporter of black tea. In this African country, the number of tea plants could decrease considerably in the coming decades, and even dwindle by a quarter by 2050, according to a new report by British charity Christian Aid.But the effects of the climate crisis could be felt long in another way before a possible tea shortage. Like some wines, the taste of tea could be altered and have less flavor than the tea we're used to drinking. Indeed, flooding and increased rainfall could alter the subtle flavors of the tea leaf and potentially reduce its health benefits, the report says.""""[W]hen tea plants get really wet they suffer a double whammy because the plants stop having the ecological cues to make these metabolites and the few that are there get diluted as the plant gets waterlogged,"" explain the study authors.A threat that also threatens other major tea-producing regions, including China, India and Sri Lanka. To prevent these adverse effects on tea, which remains the most consumed beverage in the world, the report suggests several courses of action, including strengthening international policies dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing climate financing to help countries and farmers adapt to climate change.The charity also stresses the need to cancel the debt of poor countries (already heavily burdened by the pandemic), in order to give them ""the fiscal space to better respond to the impacts of climate change. These recommendations are made in view of the COP26, which will be held in November in the city of Glasgow, Scotland. – AFP RelaxnewsQuench your thirst with tasty beverages.

"Wednesday, 19 May 2021",10:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,SUZANNE LAZAROO,From the archives: The many types of laksa in Malaysia,"A 'laksa war' has broken out amongst Malaysian netizens recently. But what are the different types of laksa in Malaysia? Here is a story from our archives where we explored the different interpretations in each state and region.This story originally appeared on StarLifestyle in two parts on 27 August and 3 September 2017, and has been edited for brevity and clarity.Flavour-drenched, hit-the-spot comfort food, a rush of spices or a hit of bracing tang, made with wheat noodles, rice noodles or even al dente spaghetti – laksa has many faces, and they’re all delicious.At its heart, it’s a dish of noodles in a spiced gravy, which can have a creamy coconut milk base or a sour asam base. A bowlful then brims with fish flakes, prawns, chicken and even blood cockles or roast pork, and shredded cucumber, pineapple, bean sprouts and herbs... and often, a spoonful of fiery sambal or pungent prawn paste, making the dish further customisable to each diner.In Malaysia, the different incarnations of laksa are bound by more than just a loose structure and character, of noodles in gravy – daun kesum is also called laksa leaf, because it’s used so extensively in the various versions of the dish. Most laksas are perfumed by it, along with other herbs and spices.Sound simple? It’s not. Here, almost every state has its own version of laksa, and broad interpretations of the one dish can also span hazy regional borders – such as laksam which is a white-on-white dish of thick, rustic rice noodle rolls in a pale, rich gravy of coconut milk and fish (or more rarely, eel), popular in the northern states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Kedah.“When you look at the styles in Peninsular Malaysia especially, it feels like there is a natural geographical progression from north to south, from the more sour, thin gravies to the creamy, rich ones, ” said celebrity chef Isadora Chai.“Malaysians are very familiar with and possessive of their own regional or state laksas – I think there’s an emotional connection for a lot of people, who have been eating a particular laksa all their lives, ” she said.You also find laksa in Thailand, where it’s called khanom jeen, made with rice noodles and also manifesting in various incarnations, and in Indonesia, where permutations of the dish are specific to towns and cities. In Singapore, the coconut milk-based Katong laksa is extremely popular, traceable to the Straits Chinese community based in the Katong precinct.There are various origin theories for laksa – in different countries, usually traceable to interactions between Chinese traders or settlers, who brought their own thin noodle soups with them, and locals, who then decked out those broths with local herbs and spices, and coconut milk.While it’s difficult to pinpoint its specific origins in Malaysia, in states like Melaka and Penang especially – both enclaves of the Peranakan community – the dish seems to have been born among the ranks of the Peranakans, the descendants of Chinese traders marrying local Malays.What is evident though, as you contemplate such a lush bowl of plenty, is that it is a fusion of sorts, in the best sense of the word – cultures, states and regions contributing various elements to come up with an extremely delicious whole.Currying flavourCurry laksa is thick and rich, with just a hint of sweetness from the addition of thick coconut milk.Possibly the best examples are the ones you find in the Klang Valley and Melaka, which are usually garnished with tofu pok (bean curd puffs), chicken, fish cake slices, prawns, blood cockles and long beans. The finishing touch? That spoonful of sambal and a scattering of mint.""Melaka laksa is quite straightforward to cook, because there’s no fish involved, you don’t have to flake the fish flesh, so it’s the fastest to cook, ” said recipe developer and cookbook author Debbie Teoh.In Penang, where curry laksa is also known as curry mee, there are two variants of the dish using yellow Hokkien noodles – one served doused in chicken curry the colour of a fiery sunrise, the other in a pale, thin coconut milk base (this has now come to be known as white curry mee).Aromatic chilli paste is then added according to one’s taste. In white curry mee, the Chinese side of laksa’s identity is manifested strongly – via cubes of congealed pork blood!“Curry mee is what I’d choose if I wanted something creamy yet light, ” said Teoh.Asam-based laksasThe thin, sour laksas spiked with asam are usually made with asam gelugor, dried slices of the Garcinia atroviridis fruit, with its slightly astringent, clean sour hit that makes your lips pucker, as opposed to the sweet-sour pulp of asam jawa or tamarind (Tamarindus indica). Some laksas use a combination of the two and in a pinch, you can sub one for the other – only the very discerning will notice the rounder, fuller mouthfeel of tamarind.Sour, spicy and laden with the intensely fishy appeal of flaked mackerel, then perked up with turmeric and freshened with pineapple, chilli, mint, laksa leaves and bunga kantan (torch ginger flower), Penang’s asam laksa is deservedly famous – and it’s still not asam laksa until a spoonful of pungent hae kor (fermented prawn paste) is stirred into the heady mix.“Ikan parang is the best fish to use – it’s sweet, with a melt-in-the-mouth texture – but it’s also the most work to get the flesh off the many small bones, ” said Teoh.In July 2011, CNN Travel ranked the dish at No. 7 for deliciousness, in a list of 50 foods in the world (later that year, a public poll saw it fall to the 26th rung though).Perlis and Kedah laksas are similar, but the former is often made with catfish or eel, while the latter sees hard-boiled egg slices added, as well as various ulam. Malay sellers tend to serve it with a spoonful of sambal nyiur, or coconut sambal.In this way, laksa also illustrates the differences in area, highlighting the produce farmed or produced in a state – such as the use of freshwater eels, fresh rice noodles in the rice-rich northern states, or the fact that Johor doesn’t really grow rice much – as well as cultural influences from the ethnic communities in an area.Hybrid offeringsAnd then there are laksas that defy convention like the laksa Siam found in Penang and Kedah that is a further fusion of both asam and curry laksa!This rich laksa is sour and fishy like asam laksa, and rich with spices and coconut cream at the same time – what you would call the best of both worlds.In Johor, the creamy laksa gravy – enriched with asam gelugor as well as lemongrass, galangal and dried prawns – is characteristically served with spaghetti, making its fusion roots stretch further beyond borders than most.According to Kalsom Taib and Hamidah Abdul Hamid in Johor Palate: Tanjung Puteri Recipes, Johor’s well-travelled Sultan Abu Bakar (who ruled the state from 1886 to 1895) loved pasta from his first visit to Italy; he instructed his chefs to switch out the traditional noodles for the pasta, and Johor laksa was born.Heading EastOn Malaysia’s East Coast, a tale of two laksas is told.Skirting the coasts of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang – and finding their way to Johor on occasion – these are the Rose Red and Snow White of a very different (and delicious) fairy tale.Siblings, they are laced with the fish and coconut milk that you would expect from their lands of origin, but manifest quite differently.The kuah putih, or white gravy, sees its noodles in a simpler, cleaner, milder gravy. It’s particularly popular in Kelantan, where it’s synonymous with the eponymous Laksa Kelantan.In the state, its purity of colour is maintained by the common use of tenggiri, with its marble-pale flesh, in homes. If you buy it from a street vendor though, you’re likely to find the cheaper ikan kembung instead.Laksa kuah putih gives the humble white pepper a dominant role in a way that few dishes do – it’s the predominant flavour in the thick coconut milk gravy, with a supporting cast of shallots, ginger and lemongrass. A squeeze of lime freshens the gravy after its slow cooking treatment.It’s a gravy that is similar to the one that bathes laksam; what differentiates them is the thick, rustic rice rolls that you’ll find in laksam.Both dishes are finished with a generous handful of vegetables and fragrant herbs – finely-sliced long beans, bean sprouts, cucumber, with Thai (daun selasih) or holy (daun kemangi) basil and the ubiquitous laksa leaf (daun kesum).“Terengganu is the only state where both laksa kuah putih and kuah merah – which we also call ‘kuah masak’ – are offered alongside for choice in the markets, ” To’ Puan Rosita Abdullah, author of Kayu Manis: A Tribute to Terengganu told Flavours magazine in a 2012 article.“The Terengganu kuah masak uses less fish, unlike in Pahang, where the gravy is thicker. The laksa paste can easily be bought in the market and fish used could be tenggiri, kembung or selayang.“The fresh green topping can include shredded brinjal and daun jambu golok (cashew nut shoots).”Because of its comparative mildness, you’ll find laksa kuah putih eaten for breakfast more often.Also based on coconut milk, kuah merah has extra fish power – in addition to the fresh ikan kembung or tenggiri it’s usually made with, the deeper, more layered flavour of salted fish is also often discernible.In addition to the other toppings, the intensely orange-yolked salted duck egg can also be a topping, as can daun kaduk (wild pepper leaf).“People usually make one or the other, ” said Datin Munira Salinger, in Red & White Laksas (Flavours, 2012).In the Pahang-born former teacher’s autobiography, My Story, you’ll find illustrations of her long-held enthusiasm for researching the history and culture of Malay food in particular, with some of her favourite recipes.She says that the kuah merah is a grander dish with more planning and prep involved, and so usually saved for more elaborate functions, rather than one-dish meals at home.“It is something that one gives to family members living nearby – often sent in a tiffin carrier as a gift, and one would provide enough to feed the whole family, ” she said.Sarawakian sensationHopping across the South China Sea, you’ll find Sarawak Laksa – a dish so fabulously rich that it sees foodies’ ears pricking up all over the country at the mere mention.While its home state boasts the most proliferation, you’ll also find it in Sabah, and in neighbouring Brunei.The fact that Sarawak laksa is made from a paste with a multitude of ingredients that also remains a jealously-guarded secret only adds to its mystery-wreathed allure.Often, when you find the dish on a menu in Peninsular Malaysia, it’s been made with the paste specially-ordered from Sarawak; a few adventurous chefs do attempt to replicate it solely by taste, but Sarawak laksa is unique in its common status as being more often made from a paste made and imported from its home state. This is so even when the dish is cooked at home.The fiery, crimson gravy is laced with spices like cumin, star anise, fennel, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, white pepper and coriander, and includes a chunk of belacan along with the ginger, chillies, lemongrass, galangal and shallots. Both chicken and prawn stocks are used, and there are also roasted, ground peanuts, sesame seeds and candlenuts in there.That explains its distinctive, delicious complexity and richness, but the key is in getting the ratio of every ingredient right.Its origins, like those of many local dishes, are anchored more in lore than stone.There’s a legend that in 1945, Goh Lik Teck, a Teochew migrant from Guangzhou, China, started selling a simpler version of the dish – with just six ingredients – in Kuching’s Carpenter Street.Another story has the laksa emerging from the Chinese and Malay cultural collusion, rather than just one noodle-seller.In the 1960s, Goh’s family started making and selling the paste to other vendors; around the same time, businessman Tan Yong Him started selling the paste commercially under the Swallow brand, and other bird-oriented brands soon followed suit.Laksa paste and intense gravy aside, the other building blocks of Sarawak laksa are rice vermicelli, shreds of chicken and omelette, prawns and fresh coriander leaves. A spoonful of piquant sambal and lime halves are always served on the side.And that’s the dish that Anthony Bourdain tweeted was the “breakfast of the gods” in 2015, when he revisited Kuching’s famous Choon Hui Cafe for CNN’s Parts Unknown; it was his second visit to the very same coffee shop, after his 2005 stop there for the Travel Channel’s No Reservations.Order popular Malaysian cuisine at discounted prices by using foodpanda Voucher"
"Tuesday, 18 May 2021",,Food,ABIRAMI DURAI,What makes plant-based meat an attractive option for pandemic-wary consumers?,"According to Mirte Gosker, the acting managing director of non-profit organisation The Good Food Institute Asia Pacific (which aims to accelerate the growth of alternative proteins), plant-based meats can help tackle a range of problems including zoonotic diseases, environmental degradation, global poverty and inhumane treatment of animals.Amidst the current Covid-19 global pandemic, it is the possibility of avoiding the next pandemic that is spurring the furious growth of the plant-based meat movement among pandemic-wary consumers across Asia and the world."
"Tuesday, 18 May 2021",,Food,ABIRAMI DURAI,The rise of plant-based meat in Asia,"Just over a decade ago, American plant-based meat producers like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods seemed like the archetypal outliers dreaming of big things that no one had ever heard about, much less thought was possible.The two were the earliest producers of plant-based meats and launched their products in an era fraught with skepticism and disbelief.Fast forward a decade later and both brands are behemoths in the plant-based alternative protein space which has become both crowded and lucrative.Global growth has been so positive that a recent report by Boston Consulting Group and Blue Horizon Corporation indicates that although alternative proteins accounted for 2% of the world protein market in 2020, this figure is likely to go up to 11% by 2035.This means that in under 20 years, nearly 1/10th of the protein consumed around the world will potentially take the form of an alternative protein.What is plant-based meat?‘Alternative protein’ is an umbrella term used to describe protein-rich products sourced from plants, insects, fungi or through muscle tissue grown in labs with cells harvested from real animals (cell-cultured meat).Of these available options, plant-based meat has been the most visible and successful since first hitting mainstream consciousness 10 years ago with the introduction of Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat’s realistic burger patties.Since then, the plant-based meat market has gained the bulk of investments – USD2.1bil (RM8.6 bil) in investments in 2020 (paired together with plant-based egg and dairy) compared to USD360mil (RM1.4bil) for cultivated meat and USD590mil (RM2.4bil) for fermentation companies, according to data released by The Good Food Institute Asia Pacific (GFI APAC), a non-profit organisation that aims to expedite growth of the alternative protein sector.This is buoyed by an increasingly global consumer base, introduced to these products via a growing number of fast-food chains, supermarkets and restaurants around the world.So what are plant-based meats? Plant-based meats, also known as meat analogues are essentially plant-derived products designed to closely resemble the physical appearance, taste, texture and structure of their original protein counterpart, whether that’s chicken, beef, lamb or other animal products.Plant-based meat primarily takes two forms – whole muscle meat and restructured meat. Whole muscle meat is meant to mimic whole animal muscle structures like chicken breasts and steaks while restructured meat (which seems to be more prevalent in the plant-based space) is essentially plant-based replicas of products like nuggets, meat strips, minced meat, burger patties, sausages and luncheon meat, to name a few.The products are usually fashioned out of a range of ingredients that can include grains and legumes including soy, wheat, rice, peas, chickpeas, lentils and mung beans which are converted into flours, isolates and concentrates. Flavours, colour components, minerals, carbohydrates and fats like coconut oil and canola oil are often also included in the overall formulation.The Beyond Meat burger patty for instance, features pea protein isolate as a hero ingredient alongside mung beans, brown rice, coconut oil and cocoa butter while Impossible Foods contain potato, soy, coconut oil and flavour from a molecule called heme.To concoct a believable product both in terms of taste and texture, plant-based meats typically go through either one of two processes – dry extrusion or wet extrusion, which basically enables plant proteins to combine with other ingredients to form a successful formulation while eliminating unwanted flavours, aromas and textures.“Ultimately, the choice of creating plant-based alternatives using dry or wet processes is a market decision. High-moisture products can provide better texture options such as meat-like fibres but will also require cold chains to be distributed. Dry products can travel, be stored more easily, and later be rehydrated, making it often more suitable for business-to-business distribution. Supply chains will decide which ones fit their needs best, ” says Adrien Beauvisage, head of region for South-East Asia and Oceania for Bühler, a Swiss multinational company which specialises in food technology.The corporation – alongside Swiss food flavour mavens Givaudan, recently set up Singapore’s ground-breaking Protein Innovation Centre.The Asian plant-based meat marketWhile the initial success of plant-based meats was centred in America and Europe, plant-based proteins have very quickly established a firm footing in the Asia Pacific region, an acceleration that has been fuelled in part by the Covid-19 global pandemic, which has driven changes in consumer perception, awareness and general enthusiasm for plant-based meats.This increased acceptance of plant-based meats was at first generated by a fear of eating animal products spurred by reports that the Covid-19 virus might have originated from the consumption of wild animals in a market in Wuhan, China.But on a larger scale the pandemic has caused a seismic shift in thinking, with many Asians now more informed and interested in issues like sustainability and health. This interest has also been enhanced by increased availability of plant-based meats and improvements in the taste and texture of these proteins.“There is compelling evidence that the global pandemic further accelerated a shift towards alternative proteins that was already gaining steam across Asia Pacific. During the first two months after the coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong-based plant-based meat company Green Monday reported that online sales more than doubled.“Similar surges were documented in Korea and other major Asian markets, which helps explain why investment in Asia Pacific-based alternative protein companies was 600% higher in 2020 than 2019, ” says Mirte Gosker, the acting managing director of GFI APAC.Research published by nutrition company Herbalife Nutrition in December 2020 backs these claims up. The study polled 8,000 people in the Asia Pacific region and found that 41% of respondents, especially in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines now display a greater openness to plant-based food options.Meanwhile, another study conducted by DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences found that 78% of Asians now believe plant-based meats are here to stay.This turn of events is interesting, because plant-based meats are not actually new in some parts of Asia, like China. In fact, old-school soy based mock meat and plant-based meat replacements like tofu and tempeh have been around for eons. The difference is, these products catered to niche, often domestic markets and never really gained an international audience.The 2.0 versions of plant-based meats on the other hand, seemed to have reeled in not only vegan and vegetarian fans but also meat-eaters who want to make meaningful changes to their diets, in line with the growing flexitarian and reducetarian global movements.According to plant-based egg producer Eat Just’s founder Josh Tetrick, “The demographics for Just Egg in South-East Asia are similar to those who enjoy the product in the United States and elsewhere in the world.“They’re 21-50-year-olds who care about eating a little bit better when they’re at home or on the go and realise their food choices not only make them healthier but contribute positively to the world around them. When the choice is delicious, convenient and accessible, switching to plant-based is easy.”While broadening the mass market appeal of new-fangled plant-based meats will be pivotal in expanding its reach in Asia, in many ways, many countries in the region already have an advantage, having been exposed to conventional plant-based meat replacements for ages now. It is this familiarity with plant-based meat substitutes that is likely to accelerate the movement in Asia a lot quicker than many other regions around the world.In fact, Zion Market Research’s 2020 report indicated that by 2025 (a mere four years away), the Asia Pacific region will hold the largest share of the global plant-based market due to familiarity with soy-based vegan proteins as well as growing environmental consciousness.“The demand and familiarity with meat alternatives already exists in Asia, which allows a new generation of meat alternatives, with better taste and nutrition profile, to grow even faster, ” affirms Beauvisage.Supply channelsThe increase in demand for plant-based meats among Asia Pacific consumers aligns with the growing number of start-ups and legacy brands developing their own range of plant-based meats.In Thailand for instance, plant-based meat firm Let’s Plant Meat put together its plant-based patty fashioned out of soy in just 12 months, and now sells it in Thailand for half the price of Beyond Meat.Other success stories include Malaysian-based Phuture Daging, which sells minced meat made out of soy, rice, peas and chickpea protein that is available in Singapore and Malaysia; Hong Kong start-up OmniMeat, which makes meat strips, mince and luncheon meat crafted out of shiitake mushrooms, pea, soy and rice and has a presence in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia; and South Korean brand Unlimeat’s plant-based beef, made from surplus grains that would otherwise be discarded. Unlimeat has successfully penetrated a few key markets like Hong Kong and even the United States.Conventional legacy brands like Nestle have also stepped up their game in Asia. Nestle’s Harvest Gourmet plant-based meat range in South-East Asia is processed in a new purpose-designed plant-based facility in Shah Alam, Selangor – the multinational giant’s first plant-focused space in the region.But perhaps nowhere has the growth and interest in plant-based proteins been more viscerally seen and felt than in Singapore, which has dashed ahead in the alternative protein game. The Singapore government has a $100bil (RM309 bil) plan to prepare for the effects of the climate crisis, and tangential to that is the goal of producing 30% of its own nutritional needs by 2030 (Singapore currently imports about 90% of its food).To facilitate this, the government has encouraged and nurtured a reputation as a food tech capital, which in turn has facilitated its rise to becoming the regional (and potentially global) epicentre of alternative proteins.This has translated into a slew of homegrown Singapore start-ups venturing into this lucrative field from Next Gen Food’s Tindle brand of plant-based chicken to Karana’s whole-plant jackfruit replacement meats.The country has also attracted numerous international brands and organisations looking to make their mark in Asia, with Singapore as their home turf.Innovative plant-based egg producer Eat Just for example, is building its first and largest plant protein production facility in Singapore and in December 2020, the company became the first in the world to get regulatory approval to sell lab-grown meat to Singaporean consumers.More recently, in April 2021, Swiss brands Buhler and Givaudan which respectively specialise in technology and food flavours, combined forces to launch the Protein Innovation Centre (PIC) – the first of its kind in Asia to accelerate plant-based foods.The centre is a one-stop space with all the equipment required to produce and test new products and the expertise to expedite product development. This technology and expertise is open to start-ups, researchers and manufacturers in Asia interested in producing plant-based alternatives and scaling production, ultimately allowing new players to make faster and more successful market entries.“By 2050, the global population will reach nearly 10 billion people and global food demand will soar by more than 50%. This will happen in challenging circumstances due the increasing impact of climate change. Finding all the protein needed to feed this ever-growing population will be a challenge, including in Asia, where roughly half of the world’s population is located.“A change in our protein diet – relying less on animal protein and more on plant-based protein – is seen as one of the most potent ways we can achieve food security. It would free up large amounts of arable land and water for human consumption.“To make it happen, it’s important that large population centres get access to plant-based products and consume larger numbers of plant-based proteins, including meat substitutes. Singapore, placed at the centre of South-East Asia and known for its cuisine derived from several ethnic groups, is a strategic location to make sure that new products developed in Asia find their audience, ” says Beauvisage."

Look for the coupon in StarLifestyle, page 4.Real Vietnamese Cooking: Everyday Favourites from the Street to the KitchenAuthors: Yumiko Adachi, Shinobu Ito & Masumi SuzukiPublisher: Tuttle PublishingPrice: RM69.29 (not available until June)This fascinating cookbook is written by three intrepid Japanese food explorers who have spent a considerable amount of time cooking and researching Vietnamese food and training with Vietnam’s best chefs to unlock the secrets to the cuisine.The three are such fans of the cuisine that co-authors Yumiko Adachi and Masumi Suzuki even have their own Vietnamese restaurants in Japan while Shinobu Ito has waxed lyrical about her love for the cuisine on many television shows.In this cookbook, you’ll discover a whole host of interesting information about Vietnamese cuisine, from the history of pho (which dates back 100 years) to the banh mi sandwich and the fact that the country is made up of 54 ethnic groups that have all contributed to the cuisine’s evolution.Recipes in the book include crispy stuffed rice paper snacks, chicken pho, lemongrass beef banh mi and steamed rice cakes with shrimp flakes, among a rich variety of traditional dishes.The great thing about this book is that aside from teaching eager neophytes how to make fascinating new Vietnamese dishes, it also imparts useful information about the origins of these meals, ensuring that readers get a two-in-one history and cooking lesson with each recipe.So if you’ve been hankering for the food of our neighbouring country, this handy cookbook offers everything you’ll need to get acquainted with Vietnamese cooking.The Pepper Thai CookbookAuthor: Pepper Teigen with Garrett SnyderPublisher: Clarkson PotterPrice: RM158.85If you’ve ever taken a peek at American supermodel and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen’s Instagram account, chances are very, very high that you would have seen her mother, Pepper, on there at some point. Teigen clearly inherited her formidable cooking skills from her mama, and in this book, the spotlight is finally cast on the Thailand-born Pepper who showcases a wide range of recipes inspired by her homeland and sprinkled with her indefatigable sense of humour.In this cookbook, you’ll discover a host of appealing recipes such as chilli-lime fried cashews, naked shrimp salad, garlic stuffed fish and pad Thai Brussels sprouts. The 80 recipes in the book aren’t all necessarily authentic – Pepper herself alludes to this as she has made modifications since moving to live in the United States (her papaya salad doesn’t always have papaya in it!) – but they are all heavily influenced by her Thai roots and certainly offer an interesting range.Also, if you’re a bit of a star-gazer, you’ll enjoy the fact that the book is literally peppered (pun intended!) with images of Teigen, her music mogul husband John Legend and their two children, Luna and Miles. The images were probably intentionally positioned to add to the allure of the book and it’s a marketing strategy that definitely pays off in leaps and bounds because you’ll spend as much time poring over the charming family photographs as you will staring at the gorgeous images of the food.So if you’re after a selection of Thai-centric meals to spice up your family meals – in much the same way Pepper has jazzed up the Legend household’s daily fare – you’ll love this cookbook.The Sourdough School Sweet BakingAuthor: Vanessa KimbellPublisher: Kyle BooksPrice: RM150This seminal book is written by celebrated sourdough advocate Vanessa Kimbell, an award-winning author who runs The Sourdough School in the British county of Northamptonshire.In this inspiring tome, Kimbell examines how sourdough baking can help enhance gut microbiome and consequently improve health and mental wellbeing.Although sourdough, gut health and mental health seem dubiously incapable of being interconnected, research has shown that switching to a healthy diet has about the same effect on our bodies as an antidepressant. Also, according to Kimbell, when our gut microbiome is out of balance, it can lead to chronic inflammation that can in turn cause food allergies, autoimmune disorders and, yes, mental health issues.The book contains fascinating nuggets of information about how the gut is indelibly linked to wellness. For example, did you know that 50% of the body’s feel-good neurotransmitter dopamine is located in the gut? Or that eating grains has been shown to modulate the microbes in the gut?Although the chunks of information that preface the recipes are lengthy and fairly technical, don’t skip them because this is what gives this cookbook an added edge and will help guide you on your journey to making successful sourdough that nourishes mind, body and soul.Recipes in the book include mulberry galette, wild blackberry tarts, brioche and live sourdough doughnuts.Ultimately, whether you’ve been trying to crack the sourdough bread code or simply wanting to eat food that makes you feel better, this book offers recipes to get you started as well as a whole lot of information on how to improve your gut health and overall wellbeing.Enjoy your comfort food at better prices with Lalamove Promo Code"
"Wednesday, 12 May 2021",,Food,ABIRAMI DURAI,This family makes heritage Johor kuih and a very rare Johor palace recipe for Hari Raya,"Idah Ayu Natalia Ibrahim is huddled around a small table in her colourful, quirky kitchen. Watching her movements with rapt attention are her three daughters – Alia Nurcinta, 18, Alicia Nurcinta, 16, and Ally Nurcinta, 11.Ayu deftly folds a piece of banana leaf into a nifty looking pocket, which she then begins filling with glutinous rice. Once this endeavour is complete, she folds the leaf again, shaping it into a triangle, before securing the finished parcel with string.While Ayu is evidently practised in the art of folding and moulding these little parcels – called lopes pulut, her children are having varying degrees of success putting their own parcels together.“Bocor!” yells daughter Alia, bemoaning a packet that has split open. Youngest daughter Ally is struggling and stops to stare in wonder at her mother’s perfect products. “Mummy buat elok sahaja (When mummy does it, it turns out so well), ” she says, as she attempts to recreate what her mother has done.Although her children haven’t quite figured out the knack behind lopes-making just yet, Ayu is determined that they persevere in making these heritage sweet treats, in the same way she grew up doing it too.“Every Raya since I was small, I had to do simple tasks given by my mother, like shaping and wrapping lopes.“And for my six siblings and I, Raya wasn’t just one day, it was one whole month, because my mum would have people over every day for a month. And each day, she would prepare different dishes for the guests who came to visit. It was tiring but so much fun, ” she says.Ayu is the daughter of acclaimed cookbook author Datin Hamidah Abdul Hamid whose cookbooks Johor Palate: Tanjung Puteri Recipes and Malaysia’s Culinary Heritage: The Best of Authentic Traditional Recipes – co-written with her cousin Datin Kalsom Taib – have bagged awards at the prestigious Gourmand World Cookbook Awards.As a result, Ayu is deeply aware of the need to preserve heritage food, like the kuih she grew up with. Consequenly, she has since taken over some of the cooking and baking roles previously occupied by her mother, who is now 71 and getting increasingly tired.“It’s part of our heritage, that’s why my sisters and I have taken over – we are the next generation that actually uses these recipes in our homes, ” explains Ayu.Chief among Ayu’s kuih-making endeavours is her famed lopes pulut, a Johor dessert that her mother used to make and which she has since become known in family circles for. The dish is essentially made up of glutinous rice (pulut) and grated coconut, drizzled with palm sugar. The technical aspect of the kuih is in the notoriously laborious (and labyrinthine) process of folding the glutinous rice into banana leaves.“It’s simple, but the tedious part is the wrapping, so everyone gets together for that. It can be torturous for my kids to do – they will try to do it, and then they will be like, ‘Oh mum, no!’Ayu’s version of lopes is delightful – plump glutinous rice coated in grated coconut, with palm sugar forming a delighful caramel-esque counterpoint to the concoction.Among her relatives, Ayu’s lopes is so revered that her aunts even buy kilos’ worth of the kuih from her for their own Hari Raya celebrations!“Most of my aunties will order 3kg or 4kg of lopes from me, because I’m the family lopes-maker. If I don’t make lopes for Hari Raya, everyone will be like, ‘Ayu, where’s your lopes?’” says Ayu, giggling.Another kuih that Ayu always makes for Hari Raya is kole kacang, a traditional coconut-rich indulgent dessert that has pride of place in Johor culinary history and is sadly quite hard to find these days.Kole kacang is made using green bean flour, palm sugar and coconut cream, but the truly unique thing about it is the topping scattered atop, which is fashioned out of coconut cream stirred on low heat until it reduces and forms oil crumbs (tahi minyak).“I didn’t like it when I was younger, because to me, this kind of kuih was reserved for the elderly. But I acquired a taste for it when I was in my late teens, so that’s why I started making it myself for Hari Raya, ” says Ayu.Her kole kacang is yummy – thick, almost pudding-ey slabs of kuih that have a melt-in-the-mouth texture. But the real star player here is the topping – crunchy little coconut-infused shards that crumble upon contact with your palate and elevate the kuih to a different dimension altogether.In recent years, Ayu has also added another rare Johor heritage kuih to her arsenal of Hari Raya desserts, and this is one is especially precious because the recipe was personally given to her by YAM Tunku Kamariah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah, the Tunku Puteri of Johor.“Bludall is a royal dessert that I got from the Johor princess. We have been family friends since I was small and she knows that I like to keep and preserve old recipes, so she gave this to me, ” says Ayu.The dessert is very similar to a cupcake and is moist and dense with a sticky top and underlying egg-laced nuances. It has a simple flavour profile but is also incredibly fulfilling and ultimately, really quite addictive.It is also a closely-guarded royal family recipe that you are unlikely to find anywhere, simply because it has never been shared before.“It’s never been revealed and not many people know to make it, except maybe people whose families have worked in the palace. Also there is some skill involved in making this, because the dough takes a long time to rise, so you have to be patient, ” says Ayu.While Ayu is scaling back her kuih-making this year, given the Covid-19 global pandemic and the fact that her full family gathering won’t be a possibility, she is determined to continue making small batches of her heritage treats.“We’re going to have a potluck Hari Raya with my siblings, so I will definitely be making all the kuih – I just don’t have to make so much this year!” she says, laughing.Ultimately, Ayu says the reason she is so determined to continue making these heritage kuih with her children is because she wants the tradition to continue.“It’s important because food makes everyone comes together and everybody looks forward to these things as they get older. And the culture of making kuih is slowly disappearing, it is very difficult now to find traditional kuih made the traditional way. A lot of people are modernising and modifying recipes.“So it is crucial to me that my girls and my son know the recipes and make and preserve them. So later when I’m older and I don’t have the energy to do it, at least I know I can go to their houses and eat it!” she says, laughing.LOPES PULUTFor the pulut1kg glutinous rice1 tsp edible slaked lime waterbanana leaves, cut into rectanglesWash the glutinous rice and soak in some water and the edible slaked lime water for about 30 minutes.

"Tuesday, 11 May 2021",,Food,ABIRAMI DURAI,This 65-year-old home cook makes 100-year-old heritage Javanese kuih for Hari Raya,"In his daughter’s sparkling kitchen, Rusli Kamaruddin, 65, is hard at work, his face a rictus of concentration as he bends over a parcel of cooked glutinous rice. Flattening it carefully, he places spoonfuls of serunding ayam in the centre of the rice before rolling it up in banana leaves and tying the ends with string.After completing one himself, he turns his attentions to his daughter Nurliyana Rusli’s concoction. Although Nurliyana is herself a trained chef who has worked in illustrious restaurants in Australia, it is her father who is clearly the boss in this kitchen.“Tekan kuat sikit (press a little harder)” he urges Nurliyana, as she works to craft a replica of the kuih her father has just painstakingly put together. She does as he says, and Rusli’s eyes light up with pride and affection, his face breaking into a wide, adorable smile.“I have four daughters but only Liyana is interested in making this traditional kuih, so I am teaching her, ” explains Rusli.Rusli has been making an arsenal of traditional Javanese kuih for over 50 years now, based on his own grandmother’s family recipes, which are well over 100 years old. In Rusli’s family, Javanese culture and traditions have been staunchly defended and maintained, even though his grandmother migrated from west Java to Malaysia nearly a century ago.Javanese migration to Malaysia dates back to as early as the sixth century and reached a climax in the pre-independence era. In the early days of settling in Malaysia, many people of Javanese descent worked hard to keep their identities intact, retaining their language, traditions and food. But over the decades, many have inter-married with local Malays and a large percentage of the cultural practices have consequently been discarded or forgotten in the assimilation process.Rusli himself stills speaks the Javanese language (Bahasa Jawa), as do his siblings, although he admits that many of the cultural practices like traditional kuih-making (which Javanese people put on a pedestal) are slowly disappearing with time.Worried that his community’s traditions will be lost altogether, Rusli is continuing to do his bit to preserve his roots, an appreciation he himself developed from a young age.Growing up in Kuala Kangsar, Perak, he revelled in the Javanese culture, specifically the cooking and baking that typically accompanied festive occasions like weddings, kenduri and Hari Raya.Which is why as a teenager, he began cooking and baking himself – first to feed his family’s needs and then to satiate his own burgeoning interest in Javanese culinary practices.“When I was younger, I always watched my mother cooking and baking. But I only started doing it myself when I was 14. I was in afternoon school and I was the only one at home in the mornings, as my siblings were at school and my parents were labourers who worked as rubber tappers in the mornings and paddy farmers in the afternoons. So I used to go to the market and buy all the ingredients to cook meals for the whole family – that’s how I started.“And even with these traditional Javanese kuih, I watched my mother making it for years before I started making it as a teenager. No one had ovens then, so she used to bake the old-fashioned way using a pot placed over charcoal fire, so that’s how I learnt to bake too. I would give my kuih to my parents to taste, and when they said it was okay, I knew I was on the right track, ” says Rusli.In many ways, Rusli’s Hari Raya kuih-making is heavily influenced by the nostalgia of his halcyon days in his kampung, when dining tables were often heaving with all kinds of kuih.“In the old days, for Hari Raya, each house that you went to, the table would be filled from end to end with 20 to 30 different kinds of traditional kuih Raya. It was so fun to see all the kuih laid out like that. I used to go to people’s homes and count the different kinds of kuih and compare to see who made the most kuih!” he says.In Rusli’s home, the tradition of making a multitude of Javanese kuih has persevered and every year, he consistently makes a few of his favourites. Like kuih sagun, a crisp, brittle biscuit-like concoction with rich tropical overtures that only calls for the use of three ingredients – grated coconut, glutinous rice flour and sugar.“In the old days, when I was young, we would make kuih sagun a week before Hari Raya, because it is quite long-lasting. Nowadays, it is hard to find people who make it and many people have also modified the original recipe and added ingredients like butter and eggs, so it is no longer the original version, ” says Rusli.Rusli also says that the interesting thing about kuih sagun is that it was devised in response to ingredients that were readily available. This availability also extended to the utensils on hand, which is why many old-fashioned recipes for this sweet treat often use the lids of jars or tins as moulds.Another Hari Raya kuih that is a must-have in Rusli’s home is bakpia Teflon, which is a little like fried bread dough filled with all sorts of fillings in the ilk of red beans, pineapples and peanut butter (Rusli’s personal favourite). The round parcels are typically fried in Teflon-coated pans (which likely gave rise to its name) or baked in the oven until golden brown.The resulting concoction is truly addictive – the soft, chewy texture of the bread gives way to an interior stuffed with peanut butter, in what proves to be a remarkable marriage of flavours and textures.“I rarely see this kuih nowadays, I think it is mainly old people who continue to make it. The thing about traditional kuih recipes is that they are simple, but you cannot make mistakes in the execution – that’s why I think younger people prefer modern dessert recipes, ” says Rusli.Rusli’s lemper pulut ayam is another kuih that makes a regular appearance every Hari Raya. This savoury treat is essentially glutinous rice (pulut) topped with serunding and rolled and sliced into discs. The dish is delightful – soft glutinous rice giving way to the addictive qualities of serunding, which in turns imparts so much flavour in each mouthful.“This is a Hari Raya staple, sometimes people use it in place of lemang. It’s a kind of Javanese savoury kuih that I grew up eating, but it is gradually being phased out and is difficult to find anywhere now, ” says Rusli.Although Rusli typically celebrates Hari Raya with his large extended family in Kuala Kangsar, this year, his will be celebrating with his daughters in Kuala Lumpur instead (he has been here for awhile already).Even though he doesn’t really need to exert himself – given the limited number of people, Rusli has already assured his children that all their favourite kuih will still be on the table come Hari Raya.“This year, I will make a small quantity of kuih, because that’s enough for everyone. But I have to do it, so that my children don’t forget their roots and the heritage meals inherited from my ancestors – even if we only make it once a year.“And now that Liyana has taken the initiative to learn how to make the kuih, I am so glad that this legacy will continue, ” he says, smiling.LEMPER PULUT AYAMFor the serunding ayam filling1/2 tsp fennel1/2 tsp cumin1/2 tsp coriander seeds10 small red onions5 cloves garlic3 candlenuts (buah keras)2 tbsp dried anchovies/shrimp, optional2 tbsp coconut oil2 bay leaves2.5cm galangal, thinly sliced2 stalks lemongrass, bruised1/2 chicken, boiled and shredded500ml coconut creamsalt and sugar to taste200g to 300g grated coconut, dry-fried until brownIn a blender, blend fennel, cumin, coriander, onions, garlic, candlenuts and dried shrimp.

"Tuesday, 11 May 2021",,Food,,Meaty goodness fit for the grill,"DAGING harimau menangis is a direct translation of the original Thai dish, sua rong hai, or in English, crying tiger beef.It is a barbecued dish of heavily seasoned beef served with a spicy dipping sauce, and usually eaten as a lettuce wrap or with steamed rice.Its name is derived from local anecdotes on cattle that had been mauled by tigers and the carcasses then recovered from the jungle.Villagers would collect the remains,usually the brisket or bottom sirloin – parts which the tiger was said to have left uneaten due to the bones obstructing the flesh.According to the folklore, since the tigers were deprived of the enjoyment of these parts of the beef, they were said to cry, hence the name of the dish.It is also said that the beef brisket, called tiger meat in Thailand, consists of layered meat and fat which resembles tiger skin.And as the meat is charbroiled, the dripping fat resembles teardrops, in addition to the stripes of the grill marks, all of which also allude to the tiger’s ‘presence’ in the dish.Daging harimau menangis made headlines recently when a businesswoman tried to patent the name.Even after she retracted her bid, the social media storm that followed not only brought greater awareness of this dish, it also entrenched its Thai origins.This dish is very popular in many Thai food courts and street stalls, with each vendor boasting their own unique recipe.The standard marinade consists of salt, sugar, pepper and fish sauce, with the addition of soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic or coriander in its many variants.The brisket cut of meat is one that contains a lot of connective tissues, so you either have to cook it very slowly over a long time, or briefly at very high heat, to no more than medium.Another way to tenderise it is to pound it with a mallet to break down some of the long and criss-crossed fibres.The recipe is so simple that anyone can prepare this dish at home.The meat just needs to be marinated for about half a day until it is almost cured.Then, briefly charbroil over an open fire or grill in a cast-iron skillet, keeping the meat medium-rare.It can also be grilled in the oven but it will be harder to control its doneness.It is served with a spicy dipping sauce, variants of which may include chilli flakes, tamarind and palm sugar instead of fresh chillies, lime and sugar.This is an excellent dish to grill at the table if you have a hibachi or electric grill at home.Served hot off the grill, these morsels of meat wrapped in lettuce are a great communal dish.Sua Rong Hai/ Daging Harimau Menangis/ Crying Tiger BeefMarinade500g beef brisket4 cloves garlic1 tsp black pepper2 tsp salt4 tbsp oyster sauce3 tbsp fish sauce3 tbsp kicap manis4 tbsp brown sugarThai-style dipping sauce6 cloves garlic10 pods green bird’s eye chilli3 tsp oyster sauce2 tsp fish sauce3 tsp brown sugarjuice from 1 lime1 shallot, finely sliced2 pods red bird’s eye chilli, finely sliced1 sprig coriander, mincedMethodSlice beef to half-centimetre-thick strips.

"Monday, 10 May 2021",,Food,CHRIS CHAN,Curious Cook: Diets before the pandemic,"There is now evidence that the Covid-19 pandemic is influencing the expected lifespans of people in several parts of the world. One would expect this effect to be greatest in under-developed nations in places like South America and South Asia, but in fact, it also significantly affects developed countries in North America and the European Union.And oddly, depending on how one measures life expectancy, this may have been a trend even before the pandemic. A productive lifespan is probably more affected by our lifestyles and diets than the pandemic, and the following explains why.Life expectancyFirstly, let us consider metrics for measuring life expectancy. Most people would know the main measure to be Period Life Expectancy at Birth (PLEB), which would be the expected period a person is statistically predicted to live from birth.A known problem with PLEB is that it is a static measure based on conditions prevailing at birth and are often relevant only to specific locations. And it is a generic measure which does not consider idiosyncrasies such as genetic diseases.So, when a serious turbulent pandemic hits, other metrics are required to measure the true impact rather than just a meaningless downward adjustment of PLEB (as the PLEB can include segments of the population not as affected by the pandemic, such as young children).One such measure is the Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL) which measures the difference between the PLEB and the average age at death of the same individuals in a pandemic-afflicted population. The MUL can also be recalibrated for shorter intervals (e.g., quarterly, monthly or even weekly periods) which can provide an independent assessment of the nature and progress of the pandemic.The MUL was applied to 159 national populations and 122 sub-national populations in Italy, Mexico, Spain and the US and the 2020 results raised some interesting statistics. Using a seven-day rolling window, the MUL peaked at 9.12 years in Madrid, 9.20 years in New York, 9.15 years in Baja California, and in Guayas (Ecuador) it even reached 12.6 years for the whole month of April 2020.In short, people in some parts of the world were suffering mortality rates on average around 10 years earlier than the PLEB. However, using selected short periods such a rolling 7-day window, can introduce bias so a longer period is required to provide a degree of smoothing. Using quarterly data, the highest MUL values in national populations were obtained for Ecuador (5.12 years, 2nd quarter 2020) and Peru (4.56 years, 3rd quarter 2020).In sub-national populations, the MUL for New York was 5.52 years (2nd quarter 2020), New Jersey was 5.56 years (2nd quarter 2020) and Baja California was 5.19 years (4th quarter 2020). The MUL showed that the pandemic was, in effect, even worse in parts of the USA than poorer countries in South America for certain periods.PLEB is increasing?The curious thing is that PLEB was increasing for much of the world until the pandemic hit last year. This should of course be seen as a huge success for modern healthcare and disease control, despite the limitations of using such a simple metric.Even so, the PLEB dropped 5 years in a row in the USA, between 2014 and 2018. A major effect on PLEB therefore was not the Covid-19 pandemic, but something worse and mostly self-inflicted.And this is the diets of people. In recent years bad diets had reached some inflection point when lifestyles started to impact the PLEB.There is always going to be an upper limit to average human longevity, perhaps roughly 85 years, currently achieved by Hong Kong and Japan, though many parts of the world are catching up. But this longevity increase in many countries is achieved despite a huge contradiction.Rates of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disorders, and other chronic diseases are also at all-time highs in many countries, mainly due to population lifestyles and diets. Yet, paradoxically, people are living longer. This contradiction can only be explained by the fact that people are living longer but in a less healthy state.One can therefore suggest medical and healthcare achievements are keeping people alive even as they are getting sicker each year. There is some evidence to support this. For example, if we adopt a measure called Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE for short), the estimate for men in the USA is a HALE of 11 years less than the PLEB, while women have a HALE of 13 years less than their PLEB. This means people in the USA spend on average over a decade of their lives in a sickened condition, requiring various degrees of healthcare and/or expensive medications.As an industry, the medical and pharmaceutical businesses should want the HALE age to be as far below as possible from the PLEB age as then there would be a larger time window available for medical services and pharmaceutical products. This is of course a cynical view often promoted by crank health websites.The more likely and fairer interpretation is that the medical and pharmaceutical businesses are simply adapting their services and products to suit the lifestyles and diets of their customers.A longer HALEThe obvious target therefore is for people to improve HALE ages to be as close to PLEB ages as possible. This usually mean lifestyle and diet changes, which although often small and of no great consequence, can make significant differences to the HALE age.Examples may be a higher intake of greens combined with a reduction of meat consumption, both dietary choices which are also good for the environment. Another case may be more cooking at home with organic ingredients, good oils, and less additives. Or taking more exercise.The current pandemic has offered everyone an opportunity to reset and re-evaluate their lives and dietary options. But judging from sales of fast foods such as burgers and fried chicken (via home deliveries), people appear to be eating as much unhealthy junk food as before.There was a hope most people would revise their junk diets during the lockdowns last year, but annual junk food sales figures proved this was probably not the case. Too many people are simply too addicted to junk food even in the middle of a dangerous pandemic.The outcome of this may already be a factor in the sobering MUL statistics mentioned above. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disproportionately targets people with various morbidities and co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and various chronic diseases.This could explain the higher MUL rates for several periods last year in the affluent USA compared to poorer countries. Over 35% of the US population are medically obese (BMI of 30 or higher), and a high percentage also have other morbidities, so the higher MUL rates were likely an indication of the poor overall health of much of the US population, which may not have been exposed so starkly before.So, the choices are, and have always been, available to everyone. It is a matter of juggling personal choices against lifespan metrics such as HALE, PLEB and MUL (during global health events)."
"Sunday, 09 May 2021",,Food,ABIRAMI DURAI,Modern working mums are finding that a little help in the kitchen goes a long way,"For centuries, mothers in Asia have played pivotal roles in home kitchens across the continent. From China to India to Malaysia, women have been the arteries pumping life into the heart of traditional home-cooked meals, which they dutifully churned out day after day to feed their hungry families. In many instances, this responsibility was fulfilled largely out of obligation and in response to what had become a clearly defined gender role.In Baba Nyonya communities for instance, recipes were often tightly guarded by family matriarchs who only passed them down the female line i.e. to their daughters or daughters-in-law.This gender-based hierarchical structure led to the development of old-fashioned platitudes like ‘The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach’ and ‘Cooking is how a mother expresses her love’ and more derogatory expressions like ‘A woman’s place is in the kitchen’ – all evidence that cooking was a predominantly female-led activity (whether a woman was interested in it or not).The oft-repeated trope that fathers were the breadwinners and heads of the household reinforced this belief that a woman’s role was to cook and clean and look after her children.But as with many things in life, the passage of time has changed this previously set-in-stone pattern somewhat. It began in the mid 20th century with an increasing number of women getting access to higher education, which in turn led to an influx of women joining the workforce. This has carved out different paths for many mothers who now straddle the responsibilities of child-rearing and housework with the travails of working life.For contrast, in 1970, female labour force participation in Malaysia was 30%. In 2020, it was nearly 56%. The increase in the number of full-time working mothers over the years (and mothers who work part-time, freelance or run their own home businesses) has had a trickle-down effect in terms of the structure and means in which feeding a family has changed.In 2021, many busy mothers have discovered that in order to provide nutritious meals for their families, a little help, some innovation and adaptation (and a few cheat days) go a long way towards satiating their children.Feeding the familyWhen business development manager Ong Leah Lee married her husband Kelvin Tan, the couple mostly ate out in restaurants or went to Ong’s mother’s house for home-cooked meals. But once they became parents, Ong and Tan decided that things had to change drastically if they wanted their children to grow up eating healthy, nutritious meals.Which is why Ong and her husband now take turns making the daily meals for their four-year-old daughter Helena Tan and nine-month-old son Ethan Tan. This way, they can split the cooking duties evenly so the onus isn’t always on one person and whoever isn’t cooking gets to spend quality time with the children.“I work from home at the moment and so does my husband and we both normally finish around 5pm. We have a live-in nanny who looks after the children and handles their daily lunch, but for dinner, my husband and I decide who will take over the cooking for the day.“We are quite fair about this division and split it according to the meal we feel like having for the day. He is good at cooking Western meals, so he is in charge of that and I am more influenced by the Chinese-style meals my mother taught me, so I often cook that. Kelvin also likes baking, so he makes a lot of desserts, kuih and even fresh bread for our breakfast daily.Ong says her daughter also enjoys helping out, which is why she fully intends to teach both her children how to cook when they are older.“My daughter is always saying, ‘Mum, can I help you do this?’ when I am cooking. So I plan to train her and her brother to cook from a young age, so this becomes a family activity, ” says Ong.Legal counsel Lynn Ann Johnson has also discovered that it takes two to get everyday meals going, especially when parents have equally busy jobs.Lynn and her husband Noel Anthony Raj used to eat out frequently at restaurants or order food in, as they both have demanding jobs.Everything changed once they had their daughter Nicole Alena Raj, 8, though. These days, Lynn and her husband run a tight ship and have a schedule mapped out between the two of them, so that the family gets healthy, home-cooked meals every single day.“How it works for us is if I’m making a big meal over the weekend, I freeze it and keep it so this lasts a couple of days over the week. But if that runs out, then my husband and I have this shift going. I wake up at 4am every morning and sort breakfast and lunch out for everyone and then take my daughter to school.“My husband comes back earlier than me in the evenings, so he gets dinner going, whether that’s making a fresh batch of pasta or a rice-based meal. And that’s how we work throughout the weekdays. On the weekends, we visit either his parents or my parents, and both our mums always make food for us to pack and take back, so that also lasts through part of the week sometimes, ” says Lynn.Lynn says without her husband pitching in, her family simply wouldn’t be able to enjoy home-cooked meals every day, as between the traffic jam and her long commute, she is simply too exhausted to cook every single meal every single day.“Oh, it definitely helps because I cannot get back home in time to make dinner. I finish work at about 6.30pm and I am stuck in traffic for at least two hours en route back home, so cooking at that time is a pointless exercise.“So we’ve done this for years, because we don’t have help. It’s just the three of us at home, so we’ve got a really good schedule where we take turns, because if not, we’d go mad, you know?” she says, laughing.For insurance agent Shamini Krishnan, cooking is a task that she has become extremely adept at, having cooked for her dad for years before her children Suvharn Raj, five, and Pavhaarn Raj, two, were born.As her husband Theeban Raj works long hours and often comes home late, Shamini and her domestic helper craft the family’s daily meals together.Still, she finds that it takes discipline to juggle work and cooking, which is why she plans the family meals at least a day in advance and makes sure her fridge is always stocked up with essential ingredients.“Every day from 9am to 1pm, I manage my insurance appointments. I also have a business as a reseller, so I try and do all my work within those hours. After that, if I have no appointments, I will cook lunch. If I cannot manage the cooking, I make sure that I prepare all the ingredients on alternate days, so my helper can do the cooking and I can continue working.“I normally also cook dinner and take charge of all the weekend meals, but if I’m not around, my husband takes over the cooking. But I actually enjoy cooking so it’s basically about managing my time well, ” she says.Khairun Nisa Mohamed Zabidi, a sustainability expert who is the head of the UK Partnerships for Accelerated Climate Transitions (PACT) programme at the British High Commission KL, has discovered that as a single mum, leaning on her extended family has helped immeasurably in ensuring that her children Aidan Salahuddin Conrad, 9, and Aria Khadija Conrad, 7, are fed.“I live 10 minutes away from my parents’ house so my kids spend a lot of time with them and have their daily lunches and dinners there. At the beginning of the pandemic, I did try making lunch for them but it was just too tiring to do that, clean up after and work as well – it was driving me up the wall, so I stopped, ” she says.Over the weekends, Khairun does sometimes cook, but more importantly, she has taught her kids how to cook so that they are self-sufficient and can whip up a meal if the need arises.“I taught my kids to cook a few years ago and they come grocery shopping with me too, so they always know what’s in the pantry. I have been doing this with them since they could read.“So like a couple of weeks ago, I got really sick and couldn’t cook, so my son made some pasta for the family meal, ” says Khairun, with pride.What’s cooking?All the mums I spoke to grew up eating mostly traditional Asian food – whether that was rice and curry, Chinese-style steamed fish and soups or Malay lauk.But since having children of their own, many have deviated somewhat from traditional recipes, given their workloads and the time constraints that they face in this busy modern world.“Oh I think people are definitely deviating from traditional recipes. Like I have my mum’s recipe for chicken curry and it’s all from scratch. She doesn’t use store-bought meat curry powder – she actually grinds everything on her own. If I were to follow the recipe to a tee, it would take forever! And it defeats the purpose to buy a pre-mix pack and make chicken curry, because it’s just not the same, ” explains Lynn.Which is why Lynn and her husband make a lot of quick, easy, healthy meals instead, like pastas, salads and wraps, which can be made fresh and fast. She also uses her oven and air-fryer a lot and avoids oily, fried food or fast food.“There are some days though when we are too tired or too lazy and we actually just have a sandwich and we are okay with that sandwich, because it’s a proper, full-on egg or tuna or roasted chicken sandwich and it only takes about 15 minutes to make, ” says Lynn.Ong and her husband meanwhile either make Chinese food or Western meals, depending on who is doing the cooking for the day.“Everything we cook is fresh and spontaneous, sometimes we have traditional Chinese food like stir-fried vegetables and steamed fish. And sometimes we make quick Western food like pasta. My daughter likes soup noodles, so I make that for her every day as it’s quite easy – I just need to make the soup and throw in vegetables, meat and noodles.“We want the kids to have a balanced diet, so all our meals have a lot of vegetables and protein, like fish. We eat a lot of fish, ” she says, laughing.Ong also adds that although she uses her mother’s traditional Chinese agak-agak style recipes, she has modernised it somewhat with the use of implements like pressure cookers.“I actually think cooking all these traditional dishes is much easier now, we can modernise the recipe and use tools like blenders and pressure cookers. Also there are better ingredient choices, so overall even though we have less time, we can do more efficient cooking, ” she says.For Khairun, her priority is simply ensuring that her kids are fed, although she does try and get them to eat healthy meals. While she often might make salads and roast a fish or chicken for her children, there are also days when she utilises cooking sauces to expedite the process of making traditional Asian meals.“I have a stack of premix cooking sauces and I just add some meat or vegetables to that, and typically these meals will be the same as what my mum used to make when I was growing up – rice, one or two meat dishes and a vegetable dish, ” she says.Shamini on the other hand, works hard to ensure her sons enjoy their meals, which is why she strives to make a varied range of Asian dishes to suit her kids’ preferences and tastes.“I think when we were young, we just ate whatever our mothers cooked – I mean, I ate rice and Indian dishes every day as a kid. But children now can be very picky. My five-year-old will ask me, “Amma, what have you cooked today?’ and go and see what is on the table. If he likes it, he will eat it, if he doesn’t, it is very hard to get him to eat it.“So I look up a lot of different recipes on YouTube and vary the meals accordingly. Like my youngest likes vegetables so I might make stir-fried vegetables with prawns for him while my eldest likes more robust dishes like ayam kicap, so I will make that for him.“I try and mix and match and make colourful meals because I want my kids to be happy and enjoy their meals, even though it takes more time and effort to do this. But when my five-year-old son comes up to me and says, ‘Amma, you are the best cook’, that just melts my heart, ” she says."
"Saturday, 08 May 2021",,Food,IAN LAU: RETRO RECIPE,Meaty tale fit for the grill,"DAGING harimau menangis is a direct translation of the original Thai dish, sua rong hai, or in English, crying tiger beef.It is a barbecued dish of heavily seasoned beef served with a spicy dipping sauce, and usually eaten as a lettuce wrap or with steamed rice.Its name is derived from local anecdotes on cattle that had been mauled by tigers and the carcasses then recovered from the jungle.Villagers would collect the remains, usually the brisket or bottom sirloin --- parts which the tiger was said to have left uneaten due to the bones obstructing the flesh.According to the folklore, since the tigers were deprived of the enjoyment of these parts of the beef, they were said to cry, hence the name of the dish.It is also said that the beef brisket, called tiger meat in Thailand, consists of layered meat and fat which resembles tiger skin.And as the meat is charbroiled, the dripping fat resembles teardrops, in addition to the stripes of the grill marks, all of which also allude to the tiger’s “presence” in the dish.Daging harimau menangis made headlines recently when a businesswoman tried to patent the name.Even after she retracted her bid, the social media storm that followed not only brought greater awareness of this dish, it also entrenched its Thai origins.This dish is very popular in many Thai food courts and street stalls, with each vendor boasting their own unique recipe.The standard marinade consists of salt, sugar, pepper and fish sauce, with the addition of soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic or coriander in its many variants.The brisket cut of meat is one that contains a lot of connective tissues, so you either have to cook it very slowly over a long time, or briefly at very high heat, to no more than medium.Another way to tenderise it is to pound it with a mallet to break down some of the long and criss-crossed fibres.The recipe is so simple that anyone can prepare this dish at home.The meat just needs to be marinated for about half a day until it is almost cured.Then, briefly charbroil over an open fire or grill in a cast-iron skillet, keeping the meat medium-rare.It can also be grilled in the oven, but it will be harder to control its doneness.It is served with a spicy dipping sauce, variants of which may include chilli flakes, tamarind and palm sugar instead of fresh chillies, lime and sugar.This is an excellent dish to grill at the table if you have a hibachi or electric grill at home.Served hot off the grill, these morsels of meat wrapped in lettuce are a great communal dish.Sua Rong Hai/ Daging Harimau Menangis/ Crying Tiger BeefMarinade500g beef brisket4 cloves garlic1 tsp black pepper2 tsp salt4 tbsp oyster sauce3 tbsp fish sauce3 tbsp kicap manis4 tbsp brown sugarThai-style dipping sauce6 cloves garlic10 pods green bird’s eye chilli3 tsp oyster sauce2 tsp fish sauce3 tsp brown sugarjuice from 1 lime1 shallot, finely sliced2 pods red bird’s eye chilli, finely sliced1 sprig coriander, mincedMethodSlice beef to half-centimetre-thick strips.

"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",3:25 PM MYT,Tech,ANGELIN YEOH,EPF: WhatsApp message about i-Sinar 2.0 application is fake,"PETALING JAYA: A viral message claiming that applications for i-Sinar 2.0 will open on June 15 is fake, according to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF).In an alert posted on its Facebook page, EPF explained that the i-Sinar programme – which was launched on Dec 21, 2020 – is still open to members until June 30.It urged members of the public not to share unverified information.The fake message which has been circulating on WhatsApp claimed that due to the implementation of MCO 3.0, EPF will open up applications for i-Sinar 2.0 after completing payments for i-Sinar 1.0 supposedly by the second week of this month.The message is most likely a prank on unsuspecting users as it includes a bit.ly link that leads to an image of a gorilla sticking its tongue out.i-Sinar is an initiative allowing those whose livelihoods have been affected during the Covid-19 pandemic to withdraw funds from their EPF accounts.There have been a number of fake online messages linked to i-Sinar. In April, EPF posted an alert reminding members not to be fooled by an SMS claiming that their i-Sinar application has been frozen. That SMS also include a fake contact number which EPF said is not the official i-Sinar hotline, adding that the message was created to steal user data.EPF has also reminded members not to respond to emails claiming that there is a tax refund payment in their i-Sinar accounts. It explained that no tax is imposed on EPF withdrawals and the email is likely a phishing attempt to obtain user data."
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Tech,,Here's why beefing up security for messaging apps is more critical than it is for others,"Cyber-security is often a game of cat and mouse with two most important research pertaining to two major directions in cryptology — breaking the available security and devising more efficient security.Among these, the security of messaging apps becomes more critical because the data that exchange hands over these apps are personal in nature with the users barely registering the after-effects in case the information gets leaked or the platform gets hacked. Hence while there is constant innovation being done on the security protocols of the software, the worry is ignorance of the users on how the leakage is happening.As famously stated by David Kennedy, Founder of TrustedSec, ""By some estimates, cybercrime is expected to globally cost up to US$6 trillion (RM24 trillion) annually. Losses of this scale put the incentives for innovation and investment at risk and will be more profitable than the global trade of all major illegal drugs combines.""This single statement shows both the vulnerability and the cost attached to cybersecurity including messaging apps. And as the world is this worried, obviously, only encryption is not working.With all of their security-minded features, like disappearing messages and identity-confirming safety numbers, secure chat apps can rightfully give one peace of mind. However, as the adage goes, though, there's no such thing as perfect security. And feeling invincible could get the users in trouble. They should definitely keep a track of what kind of video or bank information that people are sharing over any kind of platform.With end-to-end encryption transforms messages into unintelligible chunks of data as soon as a user presses send, the message isn't reconstituted into something understandable until it reaches the receiver's device. Along the way, the message is unreadable, protected from prying eyes. It essentially amounts to a bodyguard-like activity that will ride all the way and deliver exactly at the doorstep of the recipient. While the journey is generally safe during the transport, the vigilance shouldn't end there.Even when a service works perfectly factors like where messages are stored, who else has received them, and who else has access to devices that contain them play an important role in the users' security. If one is using encrypted chat apps as one tool in your privacy and security toolbox, he is relevantly safer than the user relying on it as a panacea.Global studies like The Cyber 2025 Model predicts that there will be 4.7 billion Internet users in 2025, with half of them emerging out of emerging economies like India. Thus, it is easier to say, rather than protect the security of so many users—the only option remaining is to increase knowledge. In the Covid-19 era, when every smallest economic act is government by interface over the Internet, it needs to become a policy prescription from authorities to train the people on sustainable net usage.As the newer, emerging messaging apps have started boasting about encryption features like preventing others from sharing and forwarding your messages, it is important that policy prescriptions become clearer in a country with a billion users.With the number of smartphone users in India estimated to reach over 760 million in 2021 and most of the influx coming from rural India, without proactive and pre-emptive cyber laws it will become difficult to address the most expected crime- Cybercrimes. Chatting, social networking, gaming, and video streaming are some of the preferred activities on smartphones, and consumers give access to multiple data while downloading and using these platforms.Vulnerability can only be reduced in two ways:1) Education and awareness building2) Strong policyThe balancing act between the two options will be possible only when every stakeholder — the government, the software developers, the users, the tech giants, and every platform using these platforms work hand in hand to bring the users up to date with the fallacies of the Internet. Like everything good, there is always a dark side of most useful things and responsible usage and service providers are the only answer to avoid getting busted by a hacker. – Hindustan Times/Tribune News Service"

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",11:00 AM MYT,Tech,ANDREAS LANDWEHR,"China joins race for satellite internet, but is there enough space?","In the global race for a satellite-based internet, China now also wants to establish itself as a major player.So far, this emerging scene has mainly been driven by the SpaceX company of Tesla founder Elon Musk with its Starlink project, as well as the London-based company OneWeb and similar projects from the Amazon.But now China is muscling in with the construction of its own mega-network of satellites.In April, the China Satellite Network Group was founded under state leadership and according to the plans known so far, more than 20,000 Chinese satellites are to be put into orbit.These means thousands more satellites entering earth's orbit, which is already getting crowded with the tens of thousands of satellites SpaceX, OneWeb and Amazon are planning for their internet services.First come, first served appears to be the law of the final frontier, prompting critics to condemn what they see as a Wild West-style land grab.""That is certainly the apparent situation right now,"" warns space expert Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge in the US state of Massachusetts.He sees emerging dangers for space travel from Earth, which is already full of space debris — and now even more so.""I think a major collision at some point is inevitable,"" the astrophysicist says.He suggests creating a supervisory body to control international traffic in space to mitigate the risks. The number of satellites at certain altitudes also needs to be limited to prevent overcrowding.Another problem is light pollution caused by the reflection of sunlight on the satellites' solar panels, which creates bright spots in the night sky - a major nuisance for astronomers and stargazers.The satellites of OneWeb, in a higher orbit of about 1,200 kilometres, are likely to change the natural night sky. ""The lower 500 km orbits used by Starlink are not as bad, but could still give us some issues.""A Russian Soyuz rocket launched 36 more satellites into space late in April for OneWeb, which cooperates with Airbus, expanding its fleet to 218 celestial bodies.The Starlink network operated by Musk's SpaceX already has more than 1,600 satellites in Earth orbit, putting it ahead of the pack.Behind that is Amazon with its Kuiper project and now the Chinese Satellite Network Group, which, like SpaceX, has the great advantage of being able to make the necessary rocket launches possible itself.China's plans are supported by the government's financially powerful State Assets Control and Administration Commission. Although only founded in April, the Network Group is already ranked 26th on the list of top state-owned enterprises, just behind China's three telecom giants.Previously, there were already two competing programmes, Hongyun and Xingyun, which have now been merged. ""The country wants to pool its resources and push for rapid progress,"" the Chinese business magazine Caixin comments.The mega-network has been elevated to the list of ""new infrastructure developments"" that will be promoted with the help of the government.In September, China notified the United Nations' International Telecommunication Union (ITU) of its internet service's scale — 12,992 satellites planned for the time being.""China has been slow in satellite internet,"" Caixin quotes a researcher as saying. ""Others have started to run, so we can’t wait. After all, orbit and spectrum resources are limited.""So what are the advantages of space-based internet?For one, connectivity will reach remote areas and ocean regions that could not otherwise be connected. Besides global coverage, satellite internet also offers high broadband speed and faster installation.But there are also some lingering disadvantages: high delay times, data volume limits, disruptions due to weather and high costs.Another drawback is its incompatibility with tunnel connections, ie. VPNs, which many rely on for anonymity and to view banned content in countries with high levels of censorship. However China's government, whose ""Great Firewall"" of censorship is routinely bypassed using VPNs, would likely see this as an advantage.Ultimately, the technology's pioneers see it as the internet of the future, a means to control over the future network and - from the Chinese point of view - to control of content.""At present, the business model of satellite internet is not yet mature, but from the strategic value, it has to be done,"" says Mi Lei, founder of CAS Star, a Chinese investment incubator for tech companies, in the Caixin article. ""We'll consider the commercial value after we build it."" – dpa"

"Thursday, 03 Jun 2021",5:45 PM MYT,Tech,KENNY CHEE,SG police: Beware of scam using WhatsApp accounts hacked through voicemail,"SINGAPORE: Scammers have come up with a new way to cheat people with a gold bar scheme using compromised WhatsApp accounts, Singapore police warned on June 2.They added that the accounts had been hacked using a voicemail method.In this new scam variant, the crooks pretend to be a friend of a victim by using a hacked WhatsApp account belonging to the friend and then communicating with the victim through the messaging service.Posing as the friend, the scammers tempt the victim into buying gold bars they claim are being sold at 30% below the market rate.The crooks explain that the gold bars are being sold cheaply because they were seized by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority or Singapore Customs, and were being auctioned off.A fake invoice supposedly issued by Singapore Customs is provided and the scammers instruct the victims to transfer payment for the gold bars to a list of bank accounts.Sometimes, the victims are told to meet the scammers to collect the gold bars.The victims realise they have been duped only when they do not receive the gold bars, or when they find out that their friend’s WhatsApp account had been hacked.The police said a scammer can hack into a WhatsApp account by using a voicemail method.The scammer tries to log into a victim’s WhatsApp account on his own device, and then deliberately fails the verification process by keying in the wrong six-digit verification codes repeatedly.When the verification fails repeatedly, WhatsApp will prompt the victim to perform a voice verification.It will do this by calling the victim’s phone number to provide the verification code in an audio message.If the victim ignores the call or if his or her phone is not switched on, the audio message is directed to the victim’s voicemail account, if he or she has voicemail enabled.The scammer will then seize this opportunity to access the victim’s voicemail account remotely by using the default PIN used by telecoms service providers.This works only if the victim has enabled voicemail and has not changed the default PIN for the voicemail account.After accessing the voicemail account, the scammer can get the six-digit verification code from the audio message in the voicemail and use that to take over the victim’s WhatsApp account.Once in control of the account, the scammer can enable a two-step verification process to prevent the victim from regaining control of his WhatsApp account.This new scam variant comes amid a rise in scams in Singapore.A total of 15,756 scams were reported in 2020 – a 65.1% jump in cases from the 9,545 reported in 2019.E-commerce scams, which rose by 19.1% last year, were the most commonly reported type of scam last year.The police advised the public to be wary of unusual requests they get over WhatsApp, even if sent by people in their WhatsApp contacts list.Always call friends who presumably sent the requests to verify their authenticity, but do not do so through WhatsApp, as their accounts might be under the control of scammers, said the police.And if prices are too good to be true, they probably are, so buy only from authorised sellers or reputable sources, especially for high-value items.To prevent their WhatsApp accounts from being hacked, the police said that people can enable two-step verification under “account” in their WhatsApp settings.Members of the public should also contact their telecoms service providers to change their voicemail account’s default PIN or to deactivate the voicemail feature. – The Straits Times (Singapore)/Asia News Network"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Tech,LUCAS SHAW,Logan Paul got cancelled. Now he’s making more money than ever,"On June 6, Floyd Mayweather, once regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter in boxing, will step into the ring at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, for a much-anticipated exhibition showdown that will air live on Showtime pay-per-view for US$49.99 (RM206). Mayweather’s opponent will be someone who spent his formative years training for combat in what is perhaps the bloodiest, dirtiest and most-harrowing realm of contemporary, gladiatorial life - namely, the alligator pits of social media.Mayweather will be fighting Logan Paul, former champion of the YouTube world.Paul, 26, is a boxing newbie. And yet seemingly overnight, in the wake of several bruising, social-media scandals that left his reputation in tatters, the scrappy, blond brawler has emerged as one of the top attractions in boxing, selling out arenas, racking up millions in pay-per-view sales and igniting a passion for the sweet science among a young demographic of fans who until recently couldn’t care less. ""It will be one of the most viewed events of the year, if not boxing history,” said Jeff Levin, his manager.At a time when the alchemy of cultural cancellation is under intense study, Paul’s sudden transformation from reviled Internet dude to must-see athlete is shaping up to be a draw of its own. Levin suggested his client’s metamorphosis is more reasonable than one might think. ""Logan is all about entertainment,” said Levin. ""He’s wanted to be the biggest entertainer. Sports is another form of entertainment for him. It’s very calculated.”Not to mention, very lucrative. Social media made Paul famous. Boxing is making him rich.Paul is now making more money from boxing than he ever made from hawking brands as a social-media influencer. The same goes for his younger brother Jake Paul, who has followed a similar career path from social-media provocateur to crowd-pleasing boxer and recently signed a deal for a future fight on Showtime. If the numbers they tout publicly are even remotely accurate – there is a long history of exaggeration in boxing – they are raking in millions of dollars per fight. Their time in the ring is also fuelling other parts of their business. Logan’s merchandise line generated US$40mil (RM165mil) in sales during its first nine months.""I make way more from boxing, and that’s been the case for a while now,” Jake said during an interview from Puerto Rico, where he and his brother now live.Before his descent into social-media infamy, Logan first rose to fame on Vine, a short-form video app where he posted goofy scenes of himself jumping over oncoming traffic, stripping into his wrestling uniform in a supermarket and breaking through a wall in his home to open Christmas presents. In 2015, Logan was named one of its most influential figures.When Vine imploded, Logan branched out to other platforms. Over time, he ascended to global stardom on YouTube thanks to his frequently posted videos, which tended to be short, sophomoric and wildly popular. Eventually, traditional media took note and came calling. Logan appeared on TV shows such as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and landed several major endorsement deals.Around the same time that YouTube began to focus on courting top advertisers, his antics started to become a problem. On New Year’s Eve in 2017, Logan uploaded a video to his YouTube channel showing a corpse hanging from a tree in Aokigahara, a forest in Japan that’s notorious for frequent suicides. None of which stopped Logan, then 22, from cracking some jokes at the victim’s expense.Celebrities, politicians and fellow YouTubers lambasted him for his insensitivity, and several petitions on Change.org called for YouTube to punish the star. YouTube gave Logan a slap on the wrist, removing his 15-million-plus-subscriber channel from Google Preferred, its program for premium advertising, and cancelling plans for a movie that would have cast Logan in a starring role.In the months that followed, he made matters worse by posting a video in which he tased two dead rats. YouTube suspended all advertising from his channel. Once billed as the next big thing, Logan suddenly appeared to be the latest Internet celebrity to burn brightly only to fizzle out fast.""We did have the down years after the Japan incident,” said his manager, who chalked up the events to Logan’s youth, naivete and fame. ""Everybody has issues. His just were front and centre to the whole world. And recorded.”Not long after the Internet deemed Logan to be the ultimate YouTube villain, he turned his attention to boxing, a sport that, not coincidentally, has always embraced villainous characters (see Tyson, Mike). Before long, he accepted a challenge to fight a British YouTuber named KSI. Logan had never boxed before, but he had wrestled in high school.In the end, about 21,000 people bought tickets to the fight in Manchester Arena, which was billed as the ""the biggest Internet event in history.” While the quality of the boxing didn’t bring back memories of Muhammad Ali versus Joe Frazier, people ate it up anyway. More than 1 million people paid to watch the fight live on YouTube, and many more pirated it online.Initially, some boxing fans dismissed Logan as a sideshow, an amateur narcissist giving the sport a bad name. When he approached Showtime about airing his rematch with KSI, the network turned him down. ""There is a backlash among the purists and traditional boxing fans,” said Stephen Espinoza, the head of Showtime Sports. ""I’d say there probably was a least some initial feeling of that in myself and perhaps some of my colleagues.”One of the first mainstream sports companies to grasp the potential was DAZN, which signed on to stream the rematch in November 2019 at Staples Center in Los Angeles. Unlike the first fight, which was an amateur event, this one marked Logan’s debut - and first loss - as a professional fighter. The bout turned out to be one of DAZN’s most popular events of the year.When it came time for Logan’s next appearance in the ring, DAZN somehow lost out to Triller, a short-form video app. Triller looked to Logan and his brother as the cornerstones of a new pay-per-view fight package and the key to luring more social-media influencers to join the platform. Again and again, the brothers’ fights turned into major successes.The duo’s sophomoric on-screen personas belie their strong work ethic. They have trained for months before every fight, combining jogging, shadow boxing, sprinting, yoga, high-intensity workouts and ice baths. Last year, they moved to Puerto Rico where they have set up a boxing training camp and sparred with some of the island’s top fighters.When it comes to showmanship, the Pauls evoke World Wrestling Entertainment more than contemporary boxing. They will only fight people with large social-media followings, and they treat each event as an entertainment spectacle - not just a boxing match. Pop star Justin Bieber walked Logan to the ring for his bout against KSI and later performed at Jake’s fight against mixed martial artist Ben Askren. During Jake’s most recent fight, rapper Snoop Dogg provided commentary.Along the way, the Pauls have used the tools they developed as entertainers on Vine, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook to bring attention to the events and to cater to their most ardent fans: the 14-to-28-year-old guys who love fighting and trolling. These boys, young men and man-children will buy their T-shirts and pay to watch their boxing matches. They might even pay to watch a Paul sumo wrestle or eat Jell-O.""The star-making machinery and apparatus has been taken out of the hands of corporations and put in the hands of self-made entrepreneurs,” said Showtime’s Espinoza.The more that right-minded social critics disapprove of the Paul brothers, the move their stock rises in the ring. Such is the life of an Internet heel. Saying irritating things or acting like a buffoon is simply smart business, good for the bottom line. ""It’s all a game, ” Jake said. ""It’s show business. There’s a way to play it.” – Bloomberg"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",11:00 AM MYT,Tech,FRANK BAJAK,Explainer: Why ransomware is so dangerous and hard to stop,"Recent high-profile ""ransomware” attacks on the world’s largest meat-packing company and the biggest US fuel pipeline have underscored how gangs of extortionist hackers can disrupt the economy and put lives and livelihoods at risk.Last year alone in the US, ransomware gangs hit more than 100 federal, state and municipal agencies, upwards of 500 health care centres, 1,680 educational institutions and untold thousands of businesses, according to the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. Dollar losses are in the tens of billions. Accurate numbers are elusive. Many victims shun reporting, fearing the reputational blight.More recent known targets include a Massachusetts ferry operator, the Irish health system and the Washington, DC, police department. But the broadly disruptive hacks on Colonial Pipeline in the US in May and Brazilian meat processor JBS SA this week have drawn close attention from the White House and other world leaders, along with heightened scrutiny of the foreign safe havens where cybercriminal mafias operate.WHAT IS RANSOMWARE? HOW DOES IT WORK?Ransomware scrambles the target organisation’s data with encryption. The criminals leave instructions on infected computers for negotiating ransom payments. Once paid, they provide decryption keys for unlocking those files.Ransomware crooks have also expanded into data-theft blackmail. Before triggering encryption, they quietly copy sensitive files and threaten to post them publicly unless they get their ransom payments. That can present problems even for companies that diligently back up their networks as a hedge against ransomware, since refusing to pay can incur costs far greater than the ransoms they might have negotiated.HOW DO RANSOMWARE GANGS OPERATE?The criminal syndicates that dominate the ransomware business are mostly Russian-speaking and operate with near impunity out of Russia and allied countries. Though barely a blip three years ago, the syndicates have grown in sophistication and skill. They leverage dark web forums to organise and recruit while hiding their identities and movements with sophisticated tools and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that make payments – and their laundering – harder to track.Some top ransomware criminals fancy themselves software service professionals. They take pride in their ""customer service, ” providing ""help desks” that assist paying victims in file decryption. And they tend to keep their word. They have brands to protect, after all.The business is now highly specialised. An affiliate will identify, map out and infect targets using ransomware that is typically ""rented” from a ransomware-as-a-service provider. The provider gets a cut of the payout; the affiliate normally takes more than three-quarters.Other subcontractors may also get a slice. Those can include the authors of the malware used to break into victim networks and the people running so-called ""bulletproof domains” behind which the ransomware gangs hide their ""command-and-control” servers. Those servers manage the remote sowing of malware and data extraction ahead of activation, a stealthy process that can take weeks.WHY DO RANSOMS KEEP CLIMBING? HOW CAN THEY BE STOPPED?Colonial Pipeline confirmed that it paid US$4.4mil (RM18mil) to the gang of hackers who broke into its computer systems last month.The FBI discourages paying ransoms, but a public-private task force including tech companies and US, British and Canadian crime agencies says it would be wrong to try to ban ransom payments altogether. That's largely because ""ransomware attackers continue to find sectors and elements of society that are woefully underprepared for this style of attack.”The task force recognises that paying up can be the only way for an afflicted business to avoid bankruptcy. Worse, the sophisticated cybercriminals often have done their research and know a victim’s cybersecurity insurance coverage limit. They’ve been known to mention it in negotiations.That degree of criminal savvy helped drive average ransom payments to more than US$310,000 (RM1.2mil) last year, up 171% from 2019, according to Palo Alto Networks, a task force member.WHAT'S BEING DONE ABOUT IT?President Joe Biden signed an executive order in May meant to strengthen US cybersecurity defences, mostly in response to Russia’s hacking of federal agencies and interference in US politics. But headline-grabbing ransomware attacks on private companies have started to dominate the cybersecurity conversation as Biden prepares for a June 16 summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week that the ransom demand of JBS meat came from a ""criminal organisation likely based in Russia.” She said the White House ""is engaging directly with the Russian government"" and ""delivering the message that responsible states do not harbour ransomware criminals.”The new industry task force set up to combat ransomware says it's important to have concerted diplomatic, legal and law enforcement cooperation with key allies.Ransomware developers and their affiliates should be named and shamed – though they're not always easy to identify – and regimes that enable them punished with sanctions, its report urges.It calls for mandatory disclosure of ransom payments and a federal ""response fund” to provide financial assistance to victims in hopes that, in many cases, it will prevent them from paying ransoms. And it wants stricter regulation of cryptocurrency markets to make it more difficult for criminals to launder ransomware proceeds.The task force also calls for something potentially controversial: amending the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to let private industry actively block or limit online criminal activity, including of botnets, the networks of hijacked zombie computers that ransomware criminals use to sow infections. – AP"

Most riders use either motorcycles, bicycles or electric bicycles.It said that the programme is structured to align with the requirements of the mandatory online theory test for riders of electric bicycles.Grab managing director of deliveries, Xinwei Ngiam, said its pool of food delivery riders has been growing in line with the growing demand for food delivery services, as more consumers stay home.She said the programme will help to ensure consistent and quality service from all Grab delivery riders.Meanwhile, CDC chief executive Lim Tien Hock said it is pleased to be able to conduct training on defensive riding for food delivery riders.""We have tailored the training to help the riders hone their riding skills and improve the handling of road situations, and we look forward to enhancing the safety of the riders, road users and the community,"" he said.SkillsFuture will fund between 70% and 90% of the training fees, and Grab will pay the remaining amount for its riders.Non-GrabFood delivery riders who are interested can also sign up for the programme and pay for it using their SkillsFuture credits.The move to improve delivery riders' safety awareness comes amid growing safety concerns about cyclists on the roads.Senior Minister of State for Transport Chee Hong Tat had said in April that a panel will review regulations for cyclists on the roads, and study whether theory tests and licences should be required.Denis Koh, chairman of personal mobility device enthusiast group BWSS, said the new training programme will be especially helpful for food delivery riders who switched from e-scooters to either e-bikes or bicycles.""This will provide occupational riders with the necessary skills and also knowledge of the latest rules, thus making paths and roads safer for all users,"" he said.""Most importantly, it will help e-bike riders pass the new mandatory theory test."" – The Straits Times (Singapore)/Asia News Network"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,Tech,,Android 12 will let users make ads dumb,"Android 12 is expected to bring a host of new privacy-friendly features to smartphones. The list includes the ability to disable app access to camera and microphone, clipboard access notification and a new Settings dashboard. Now, a new report says that the Android 11 successor will do a lot more than that. It will make ads on Android dumb.Google Play services give developers access to an advertising ID, which they can use to monetise their apps. It also gives users better control over their data while letting third-party developers monetise their apps using a standard system. It also enables users to reset their identifier or opt-out of personalised ads within Google Play apps.With Android 12, Google is planning to change that. Google, via an update on its support page, said that it will remove the advertising ID when a user opts out of personalisation using advertising ID in Android Settings.""Any attempts to access the identifier will receive a string of zeros instead of the identifier. To help developers and ad/analytics service providers with compliance efforts and respect user choice, they will be able to receive notifications for opt-out preferences,"" Google wrote on its support page.The company also said that the apps targeting Android 12 will need to declare a Google Play services normal permission in the manifest file.What all of this means is when Android 12 is rolled out, users who opt-out of having an advertising ID will stop getting personalised ads that are based on their preferences. While users will not be able to shun all ads for good, they will certainly be able to make them less intrusive and hence dumb.As far as the availability is concerned, Google has said that this feature will be rolled out in phases, which means that not all Android users will get it at once. It will first arrive on Android running on Android 12 devices later this year and expand to apps that support Google Play next year.""This Google Play services phased rollout will affect apps running on Android 12 devices starting late 2021 and will expand to affect apps running on devices that support Google Play in early 2022. In July, we will provide an alternate solution to support essential use cases such as analytics and fraud prevention,"" the company added in its post. – Hindustan Times/Tribune News Service"

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Tech,BAILEY ALDRIDGE,"Cyberattacks have hit pipelines, meat industry and more. Is the pandemic to blame?","In May, Colonial Pipeline — which supplies nearly half of the East Coast's fuel — learned it was hit by a cyberattack.The attack, which feds say was carried about by the ransomware group DarkSide, forced the company to shut down its 5,500-mile pipeline system that stretches from Texas to New Jersey. In response, drivers in the Southeast rushed to fill their cars with gas — drying up gas stations across the region and sparking a fuel shortage.In the same month, a cyberattack on meat processor JBS forced the company to shut down operations at facilities across the US. Most recently, a ransomware attack halted the online services of the Steamship Authority of Massachusetts, which ferries passengers between Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and the state's outer banks.Cybercrimes similar to these attacks and attacks on individuals have recently been on the rise, data show. And while experts say a number of factors could be contributing to the jump, some say the Covid-19 pandemic may be partially to blame.An increase in cybercrimesIn 2020, the FBI collected data for 791,790 suspected internet crimes, an increase of more than 300,000 compared to 2019, according to a report released in March. The top three crimes were ""phishing scams, non-payment/non-delivery scams and extortion.""The FBI says losses related to those crimes totalled more than US$4.2bil (RM17bil).Between March 12,2020, and May 15,2021, the number of Internet crime complaints jumped from seven million to six million total since 2000, the FBI says. Previously, it took from October 2017 to March 2020 for total complaints to increase by one million.In April 2020, FBI officials said they were receiving between 3,000 and 4,000 cybercrime complaints each day — up from 1,000 daily complaints before the Covid-19 pandemic, The Hill reported.Industry experts estimate that, in 2021,""almost six ransomware attacks will occur every minute"" — an increase from ""one attack every 40 seconds in 2016 and one every 14 seconds in 2019,""consumer information site Safeatlast says.In 2021, ransomware recovery costs are expected to surpass US$20bil (RM82bil), the group says.What's causing the increase?Today ransomware attacks are more advanced than in the past, Safeatlast says.""According to cybersecurity experts, hackers have learned they shouldn't target thousands of victims at once and expect a few of them to succumb to their demands,"" the group says. ""Instead, cybercriminals now focus on specific organisations that are more likely to pay the ransom to have their data restored as soon as possible.""Additionally, hacking groups are increasingly using cryptocurrency, which is harder to trace, to demand ransom, according to Safeatlast.But some say the pandemic could also have played a role in the increase in cyberattacks.Digital communications company Investisdigital wrote in May that ransomware attacks are becoming more common in part because ""malicious parties are capitalising on companies being distracted by the massive disruption caused by the Ccovid-19 pandemic.""Cybercriminals took advantage of companies adjusting to the ""unique challenges"" of remote work by carrying out hacks, data breaches, video hijacks and fraud, the Cincinnati Business Courier reported in June 2020.Microsoft also said in 2020 cybercriminals did ""adapt their tactics to match what was going on in the world.""""It wasn't until Feb. 11, when the World Health Organisation named the global health emergency as 'COVID-19', that attackers started to actively deploy opportunistic campaigns,"" Microsoft says. ""The week following that declaration saw these attacks increase eleven-fold.""The FBI noted there was a surge in Internet crimes ""exploiting the Covid-19 pandemic"" in 2020. It says it received ""over 28,500 complaints related to Covid-19, with fraudsters targeting both businesses and individuals.""Microsoft says its data shows the surge in coronavirus-related attacks was ""really a repurposing from known attackers using existing infrastructure and malware with new lures"" and that cybercriminals targeted key players working to address the pandemic.""These shifts were typical of the global threat landscape, but what was peculiar in this case was how the global nature and universal impact of the crisis made the cybercriminal's work easier,"" Microsoft says.

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",8:18 PM MYT,Tech,SANKALP PHARTIYAL,India to Twitter: Comply with IT rules or face 'unintended consequences',"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has told Twitter Inc it has one last chance to comply with new IT rules, or face ""unintended consequences"" according to a copy of an official letter seen by Reuters.The new rules - which were announced in February and which became effective at the end of last month - are aimed at regulating content on social media and making firms such as Facebook, its WhatsApp messenger and Twitter more accountable to legal requests.They also require big social media companies to set up grievance redressal mechanisms and appoint new executives to coordinate with law enforcement.India's technology ministry wrote to Twitter on May 26 and May 28 on the new rules, but the company's responses ""neither address the clarifications sought by this ministry nor indicate full compliance with the Rules,"" said the June 5 letter from the technology ministry to Twitter deputy general counsel Jim Baker.The letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, said that among other things, Twitter had yet to inform the ministry about its chief compliance officer, and its grievance officer and nodal contact person were not employees as mandated by rules.It said such non-compliance would lead to ""unintended consequences"" including the possibility that Twitter could be held accountable for content posted on it, an exemption it currently largely enjoys.It added, ""However, as gesture of goodwill, Twitter Inc is hereby given one last notice to immediately comply with the Rules.""The technology ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter declined to comment.The new IT rules have spurred legal battles, including a lawsuit filed by Facebook-owned WhatsApp that accuses the government of exceeding its legal powers by enacting rules that will force the messaging app to break end-to-end encryption.(Reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Frances Kerry)"

According to a March 9 memo, DMV officials asked CJ Moore, a director of Autopilot software, about Musk’s claims that Teslas would be capable of fully autonomous driving this year.""Elon’s tweet does not match engineering reality per CJ,” Miguel Acosta, chief of the California DMV’s autonomous vehicles branch, wrote in the memo. Musk tweeted and spoke during an earnings call in January about his confidence that Tesla could achieve full autonomy as soon as this year.While Musk has said for several years he believes Tesla is on the verge of delivering Level 5 autonomy — meaning its cars won’t require human intervention — drivers have needed to keep their hands on the wheel when using Autopilot.Tesla raised more than US$2bil (RM8.24bil) two years ago after Musk made several predictions about robotaxis that didn’t materialise.Tesla shares rose 0.9% as of 9:40am, Friday in New York. The stock has dropped about 6% this year.""Tesla is at Level 2 currently,” Acosta wrote in the memo in March. ""Tesla indicated that Elon is extrapolating on the rates of improvement when speaking about L5 capabilities. Tesla couldn’t say if the rate of improvement would make it to L5 by end of calendar year.”The memo is a rare window into how Autopilot engineers have had to square the high expectations set by their hard-driving boss with regulators’ concerns.Last month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board said they would investigate a fatal crash in Texas involving a Tesla that crashed into a tree. No one was in the driver’s seat, according to police and a fire marshal report.Four days after that incident, the California DMV sent a letter to Eric Williams, Tesla’s associate general counsel, encouraging the company to ""provide clear and effective communication to customers, buyers and the general public” about its Autopilot features, their capabilities and how they should be used.""As Tesla is aware, the public’s misunderstanding about the limits of the technology and its misuse can have tragic consequences,” Acosta wrote. – Bloomberg"

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,Tech,ROD MINCHIN,Twitter study finds correcting misinformation may make problem worse,"Correcting misinformation on Twitter may only make the problem worse, according to a study. Researchers offered polite corrections complete with links to solid evidence, in replies to flagrantly false tweets about politics.But they found this had negative consequences, leading to even less accurate tweets and greater toxicity from those being corrected. Lead author Dr Mohsen Mosleh, from the University of Exeter, said the findings were ""not encouraging.""""After a user was corrected they retweeted news that was significantly lower in quality and higher in partisan slant, and their retweets contained more toxic language,"" he said.To conduct the experiment, the researchers identified 2,000 Twitter users, with a mix of political persuasions, who had tweeted out any one of 11 frequently repeated false news articles.All of those articles had been debunked by the fact-checking website snopes.com. Examples included the incorrect assertion that Ukraine donated more money than any other nation to the Clinton Foundation, and the false claim that Donald Trump, as a landlord, once evicted a disabled combat veteran for owning a therapy dog.The research team then created a series of Twitter bot accounts, all of which existed for at least three months and gained at least 1,000 followers and appeared to be genuine human accounts.Upon finding any of the 11 false claims being tweeted out, the bots would then send a reply along the lines of: ""I'm uncertain about this article — it might not be true. I found a link on Snopes that says this headline is false."" The reply would also link to the correct information.The researchers observed that the accuracy of news sources the Twitter users retweeted promptly declined by roughly 1% in the 24 hours after being corrected.Similarly, evaluating more than 7,000 retweets with links to political content made by the Twitter accounts in the same 24 hours, the researchers found an upturn in the partisan lean of content and the ""toxicity"" of the language being used.However, in all these areas — accuracy, partisan lean, and the language being used — there was a distinction between retweets and the primary tweets being written by the Twitter users. Retweets, specifically, degraded in quality, while tweets original to the accounts being studied did not.""Our observation that the effect only happens to retweets suggests that the effect is operating through the channel of attention,"" said co-author Professor David Rand, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.""We might have expected that being corrected would shift one's attention to accuracy.""But instead, it seems that getting publicly corrected by another user shifted people's attention away from accuracy — perhaps to other social factors such as embarrassment.""The effects were slightly larger when being corrected by an account that identified with the same political party as the user, suggesting that the negative response was not driven by animosity towards counter-partisans. – dpa"

"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",12:47 AM MYT,Tech,ELIZABETH CULLIFORD,"Facebook suspends Trump until 2023, shifts rules for world leaders","(Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Friday suspended former U.S. President Donald Trump until at least January 2023 and announced changes to how it will treat world leaders who break the rules on its site.Facebook had suspended Trump's account the day after the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol Hill riot, determining he had incited violence. That suspension will last at least two years from the date of the initial block and would only be lifted if the risk to public safety has receded, Facebook said on Friday.Trump criticized the decision as a form of censorship and an insult to his voters.This new timeline denies Republican Trump a major social media megaphone ahead of the November 2022 congressional elections. However, it means he may be able to return to Facebook well before the next presidential election in late 2024.Trump has been permanently banned by Twitter and remains suspended by Alphabet's YouTube after the riot. Trump, who this week shut down his recently-launched blog, has teased plans to start his own platform.""Given the gravity of the circumstances that led to Mr. Trump's suspension, we believe his actions constituted a severe violation of our rules which merit the highest penalty available under the new enforcement protocols,"" Facebook's head of global affairs Nick Clegg said in the post.Facebook's oversight board, an independent group funded by the company who rule on a small slice of controversial content decisions, in May upheld the company's unprecedented block on Trump. However, the board ruled it was wrong to make the ban indefinite and called for a ""proportionate response.""In a statement on Friday, Trump slammed the decision and repeated false claims of voter fraud: ""Facebook's ruling is an insult to the record-setting 75M people, plus many others, who voted for us in the 2020 Rigged Presidential Election. They shouldn’t be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing, and ultimately, we will win. Our Country can’t take this abuse anymore!"" Several investigations have not found evidence of election fraud.Trump added, ""Next time I'm in the White House there will be no more dinners, at his request, with Mark Zuckerberg and his wife. It will be all business!""Facebook said it would work with experts to decide when the public safety risk had subsided for Trump to be restored to its platforms. It said it would evaluate factors including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest.It also said there would be a set of escalating sanctions that would be triggered if Trump broke further rules that could lead to his permanent removal.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki, speaking to reporters, said of Facebook's decision on Trump that it felt ""pretty unlikely that the zebra is going to change his stripes over the next two years, we'll see.""POLICY CHANGESSocial media companies have grappled in recent years with how to handle world leaders and politicians who violate their guidelines.On Friday, the Nigerian government said it had indefinitely suspended Twitter's activities in the country, two days after the company removed a post from President Muhammadu Buhari that threatened to punish regional secessionists.In a major reversal that also came as part of Facebook's Friday responses to its oversight board, Facebook said it was ""removing the presumption we announced in 2019 that speech from politicians is inherently of public interest.""The company said it now would weigh violative content from politicians against the potential risk of harm in the same way it does for all users. It will also disclose when it does use its ""newsworthiness"" exemption.However, a Facebook spokesman confirmed politicians' posts will remain exempt from third-party fact-checking.Facebook has come under fire from those who think it should abandon its hands-off approach to political speech, but has also been criticized by those, including Republican lawmakers and some free-expression advocates, who saw the Trump ban as a disturbing act of censorship.Its decision on Trump and new policy changes could have major ramifications for how Facebook handles rule-breaking world leaders and officials on its services. It said that public figures who violate its rules by inciting or celebrating ongoing violence or civil unrest could be restricted for periods ranging from one month to two years.Social media companies have faced calls from some rights groups and activists to be more consistent in their approach to other leaders who have violated or pushed their rules. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and lawmakers in India's ruling party have drawn scrutiny.Facebook also gave some transparency into its standard system on how many ""strikes"" users can receive before suspensions, which normally last up to 30 days.The Trump case has been seen as a test for how the company responded to the ruling and recommendations of its recently-established oversight board.The board also recommended Facebook review its role in the election fraud conspiracy that led to the Jan. 6 siege, which Facebook said it would partially implement through its partnership with academics studying the role it played in the 2020 U.S. elections. Facebook said it was implementing 15 of the 19 board recommendations.(This story was refiled to remove extraneous word ""Leader"" in paragraph 20.)(Reporting by Elizabeth Culliford and Akanksha Rana; Additional reporting by Steve Holland, Susan Heavey, Paresh Dave, and Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Arun Koyyur, Nick Zieminski and Grant McCool)"

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,,‘A-Level’ above,"ELEVEN A-Level students from Sunway College received a total of 15 prestigious Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE) awards for their outstanding performance in the recent Cambridge examination series.Sunway is the recipient of the highest number of Outstanding Cambridge Learner Awards in Malaysia for the sixth consecutive year, the college said in a press release on May 18.The Outstanding Cambridge Learner Awards celebrate the success of students taking Cambridge examinations in over 40 countries around the world.As a testament to the institution’s consistent quality and result, the college was also named the number one provider in the country by the CAIE office of Malaysia.Of the 11 students, six were awarded the highest distinction, which is ‘Top in the World’. The ‘Top in the World’ awards recognise those who achieved the highest standard mark in the world for a single subject.One of the students, Chai Zi Yang, was awarded first place and given the title ‘Best Across Four’ by CAIE for his exceptional performance in the subjects of Mathematics and Physics. The ‘Best Across’ awards are issued to learners who achieved an A grade and attained the first highest cumulative total standard marks over a set number of subjects.“My experience in the past one-and-a-half years here has been wonderful and a delight thanks to the competent and dedicated teachers and staff members. I am truly grateful to my teachers and Sunway College for providing this learning experience.“My future is still hidden behind the mist of uncertainty which I hope will clear up as I go along.

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,SANDHYA MENON,We’re taking on the world,"THE more we evolve, the more demands roll in on the kind of students our education system should produce.There is a growing need for youths to be well informed on world events and current topics.To produce a generation of students with a global mindset, the Global Citizenship Education (GCED) module was rolled out in schools across the country, beginning with lower secondary students on April 5.The module, which is on the Education Ministry’s Digital Educational Learning Initiative Malaysia (Delima) online platform, is embedded into subjects like Mathematics, Science, History and Geography.The aim behind the GCED module, which is part of the existing curriculum, is three-fold, United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) Malaysia education specialist Azlina Kamal told StarEdu.“It acts as a tool for forging peace. Young people are their own best advocates and the GCED module provides them with the understanding, skills and values needed to cooperate in resolving the interconnected challenges of the 21st century.“It can help them to express, innovate, exercise agency, and take an active role in understanding and changing themselves, their communities, and ultimately the world.“Secondly, we want to raise globally-knowledgeable learners.“We know global citizens have a broader understanding of global events and they are able to form well-rounded opinions based on a wide breadth of knowledge. We all want this for our children.“Finally, the module helps to develop empathetic individuals as we want to cultivate empathy, understanding in our children, and teach them respect for other cultures and perspectives,” explained Azlina.Unicef partnered with social enterprise Arus Academy to collaborate with the Education Ministry on the module – an effort which began in 2017.The experts who worked on the GCED framework, she added, were careful to ensure that the module would complement the curriculum and not be an added burden or an extra component to the work teachers are already doing.Module structureIt is crucial to educate students on global events while laying hold of solutions, Azlina stressed.While some parts of the world have pressed ahead in technological advancements, human rights violations continue to persist.Educating students on these topics is where the GCED module comes in, she added.“It provides project-based lessons and lesson plan examples for students and teachers to explore.“Teachers can run through the lessons with their students or the students can go through the lessons in their own time.“Each project is mapped to the national curriculum, the global citizenship education and sustainable development learning objectives based on the three domains of learning – cognitive, socio-emotional and behavioural.“On the Delima platform, students learn through videos, discussions and interactive activities with different themes such as climate change and gender equality.“Building sustainable cities is also addressed,” she said, adding that the lessons are designed to inspire students to solve pressing global problems.These projects, she said, contextualise learning through real world events and examples, and provide opportunities for students to gain global citizenship competencies which include knowledge and skills in social justice, sustainable development, human rights, identity and diversity.“The module supports target 4.7 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 4, Quality Education) – which is to ensure that all learners acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development,” she said, adding that Malaysia is committed to achieving this goal by 2030.Student-centred learningGCED, said Azlina, is another way of delivering the curriculum through student-centred methods.“It puts more focus on the learning process and its assessment is interwoven throughout the process.“The idea of GCED is also present in a subject like Civics Education because it teaches us how to live together with those from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds.“Instead of merely creating a separate subject, GCED is embedded into subjects which allows students to see that what they are learning is relevant to the real world.”The information and knowledge that students learn in the curriculum, Azlina said, must be practised so that they can develop values and attitudes that promote peace.“We live in an increasingly interconnected world and while it poses many opportunities, it also comes with challenges where our youth need to make sense of the division, conflict, environmental change and inequalities that are happening.“This requires skills in empathy, self awareness, reflection, conflict resolution, and managing complexities and uncertainties,” she said, adding that making the module a part of everyday education increases that awareness, and allows students to engage and explore the complexities of global and local issues through multiple perspectives.GCED pilot and programmesA pilot programme for the module was held throughout the 2019 school year until February last year involving Form One students in four secondary schools across the country.Teachers tested out the various projects in the module with their students, Azlina said, adding that a workshop was also held with school leaders to ensure schools are adopting GCED in developing a more positive and global school culture.Key GCED elements were integrated into the pilot student programmes such as “30 for 30” and “Guardians of the Children” where students explored current issues to come up with solutions through discussions, debates and negotiations, she said.Current projects available in the module include “Jejak Covid” (Tracking Covid) which is embedded into Geography and “Quality Education for All” which is a Mathematics project.“Iklim Dunia” (World Weather) is taught during History and “Save Tasik Chini” is incorporated into Science lessons.These modules can be accessed on Delima via https://sites.google.com/moe-dl.edu.my/gcedmalaysia/projects.“We’re collecting lesson plans and best practices from classrooms to be featured on the platform so that moving forward, we can create a repository of GCED resources by Malaysian teachers and students,” she said.Former Education director-general Datuk Dr Habibah Abdul Rahim said the approach to implementing the module has to be different from how subjects are taught.Habibah, who is also an Adjunct Professor at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, had led the development of the module before her recent retirement.“What was piloted was more of the changes and how to approach the content and pedagogy.“It has to be more thematic and dynamic to reflect what’s happening in the world – today’s information will be different tomorrow.“It’s not just about providing facts and figures because that will become obsolete, so how we approach global citizenship has to be different,” said."

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,,Pharmacy: Post-pandemic,"HIGHER education has undergone rapid and adaptive changes in its teaching and learning methods since the emergence of Covid-19.It would not be a stretch to say that most pharmacy schools globally, particularly Malaysia, were equipped to a certain extent in tackling the online learning environment once the world declared a health emergency.Student-centred learning techniques, or more commonly known as blended learning, was already a staple in pharmacy education.A mixture of face-to-face classes and practicals were normally supplemented with online learning management systems and various virtual learning tools.However, since the pandemic, pharmacy education has seen a paradigm shift from existing student-centred blended learning to complete online teaching and assessments.Institutions that appeared to be in the fiscal position pre-Covid-19 started to invest in remote learning technologies, software and hardware, and information technology (IT) teams.This support was able to give pharmacy academics more options to adapt to their teaching and assessments.Pharmacy academics around the globe had to respond quickly and efficiently by determining appropriate video conferencing tools that served both the lecturers and students. These included accessibility, user-acceptability and the subject’s learning outcomes.Of course, all the challenges could not be overcome without the necessary pain of trial and error.The main challenge was the fall in the motivation of both students and educators because students were not physically present in class and there was a loss of educational settings and contexts adversely affecting both.Didactics in virtual learning need longer structuring times, and new ways are needed to reach students, which must consist of more than being in front of a computer.Another major challenge for pharmacy education was in laboratory classes and experiential placements in healthcare attachments. How could you replace a hands-on learning experience when students could not leave their homes?The Malaysian National Medicines Policy emphasises public access to medicines and reliable health systems, and these needs are amplified in times of crisis. To address these needs, pharmacists in community and hospital settings are critical.In the Professional Pharmacy Oath, pharmacists are called to place the needs of others above their interests. Our students are pharmacists in training who, now more than ever, are a critical part of our health care delivery.In response to the pandemic, pharmacy faculties removed all students from practice sites to reduce transmission risk and allow practising pharmacists to focus on essential services.Patient care scenarios depicting real health care issues in the Malaysian population were used in virtual problem-based and case-based learning to mimic experiential learning as much as possible.Virtual role-play simulations were a vital part of pharmacy practice education. Videos and simulation of practical sessions were filmed, and in silico modelling or docking software was used to facilitate practical classes in engaging and innovative ways.Additionally, interactive modules, assessments based on real-world scenarios, forums designed to discuss and solve problems, and synchronous learning sessions that involve discussions were used.Pharmacy educators and students noted that not all virtual activities could replace face-to-face learning in wet laboratory sessions and experiential placements in healthcare environments.There were difficulties in developing hands-on skills and behaviours, as these activities were often designed to apply and practise the knowledge delivered in lectures.Students missed having face-to-face interactions as they were unable to focus on online classes. They also missed the socialisation process in the university environment.As such, the hybrid learning model seems to be the best option for moving forward post-pandemic.It integrates virtual and face-to-face learning into a cohesive experience. Advanced teaching and learning methods are related to the future of pharmacy education in the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0). Certain factors such as the intended learning outcomes, student needs, access to technology and digital literacy need to be assessed and balanced to determine if this approach fits the pharmacy educational goals best.Higher education is changing and disruption is inevitable.The Covid-19 pandemic has taught pharmacy academics that tailored education with technological impact is possible. The existence of four generations of educators and students in 2020, namely, baby boomers, Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z, propelled the government and higher education providers to tackle the generational shifts.Moving forward, the government needs to relook at the implementation of such learning and equity in the access to digital learning platforms at all economic levels.ASSOC PROF DR MOGANA SUNDARI RAJAGOPALDeanFaculty of Pharmaceutical SciencesUCSI University"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,,Young Malaysians to become citizens of the world,"WE are globally interconnected – now more than ever in human history.News of events taking place halfway across the world reaches our mobile phones faster than we can say “Jack Robinson”!The Covid-19 pandemic, too, has pushed educational institutions around the world to fully embrace online learning.These changes require us to produce students with a global perspective and mindset.Taking cognisance of this and the speed at which globalisation is happening, institutions have increasingly moved towards inculcating 21st century learning in classrooms to allow cross border education to take place and to produce more informed citizens.Understanding how crucial this is, the Global Citizenship Education (GCED) module has been embedded into the local curriculum.Launched on the Education Ministry’s online learning platform Digital Educational Learning Initiative Malaysia (Delima) on April 5, the module seeks to educate students on the values, attitudes and behaviours that support responsible global citizenship.United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) Malaysia education specialist Azlina Kamal told StarEdu that the module helps young people to understand these issues and how to find sustainable solutions.The module aims to produce learners with global knowledge, she said.“The goal of GCED is to empower learners to engage and assume active roles, locally and globally, to face and resolve global challenges, and to become proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure and sustainable world,” she said.The experts involved in putting the module together were teachers, subject matter experts and ministry officials from various divisions, under the leadership of former Education director-general Datuk Dr Habibah Abdul Rahim, who after 35 years in the civil service, retired the same day the module was launched.Habibah’s first exposure to what global citizenship meant was when she was helping her son pack to go abroad.“I was packing stuff like his kain pelikat to remind him of Malaysia but he said: ‘I am a global citizen. I don’t need all these material things to remind me of home because Malaysia is in my heart and in my mind’.“That was a long time ago but it was my first exposure to the term global citizen,” she recalled laughingly.She said working with Unicef on the module brings Malaysia on board with what’s happening around the world.“It links our teachers and schools to others — it puts us on the map and changes how we look at things.“We need the younger generation to be open and understanding so that they can accept other people’s values and the different approaches to doing things — that’s part and parcel of being a global citizen.“It’s not about changing your principals but you cannot simply be on your own and not accept others,” she said. – By SANDHYA MENON> MORE STORIES ON PAGE 5"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,SANDHYA MENON,Moulding students into global citizens,"PETALING JAYA: Malaysian students are being moulded into global citizens to increase their competitiveness with the introduction of a new module in schools.Global Citizenship Education (GCED), said United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) Malaysia education specialist Azlina Kamal (pic), would be taught in all schools at the primary and secondary level next January.The module, which is embedded in the existing curriculum, was recently rolled out in secondary schools nationwide.“We started with the lower secondary students first but the module will be extended to primary schools soon, ” said Azlina.She said the module, incorporated into Mathematics, Science, History and Geography lessons, would train students to find solutions to pressing global issues.“The aim is to equip students with knowledge of global events so that they are able to form well-rounded opinions, ” she said, adding that students will also develop empathetic skills and respect for other cultures and perspectives.Those involved in developing the module were teachers themselves, subject matter experts and ministry officials from various divisions, under the leadership of former Education director-general Datuk Dr Habibah Abdul Rahim who retired on April 5 – the day the module was launched.Habibah, who is also an adjunct professor at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, said GCED was in line with helping Malaysia become a global player.“We are no longer living in our own communities; we are all affected by what is happening beyond our communities.“This comes naturally due to the advancement of digital technology and if we cannot relate and react to what’s happening around us on a larger scale, or if our attitudes and values are not in tune with the world at large, we cannot become a global player, ” she said.Describing the module as progressive, Parent Action Group for Education president Datin Noor Azimah Abdul Rahim lauded the inclusion of topics such as gender equality."
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,,EQ IS WHAT MAKES THE CLASSROOM WORK,"MIKE Choong Wai Keng is a lecturer at The Design School at Taylor’s University. When asked about how students should apply their knowledge in forming solutions to an existing problem in society or in the industry, his answer is simple: empathy.“Empathy is the most neglected aspect when designing solutions for society or industry, ” he says.He adds that the School embraces ‘”design thinking”, whereby students are “trained to empathise with the target market or audience to discover the real insights that are often difficult to be explained or communicated.”However, empathy and design thinking are usually not what comes to mind with regard to tertiary education. Many lecturers and students also do not make mastering soft skills a priority.Taylor’s decided to walk the talk when it came to embedding life skills into all of their academic programmes, while giving every student an opportunity to be a creator. The idea is to intentionally nurture the three intelligences of “intellect”, “practical wisdom” and “craft” among its graduates through Taylor’sphere.“Students learn theory from their lecturer or textbooks, but knowledge needs to be applied in real life situations for learning to be effective, ” says Taylor’s School of Psychology lecturer Pang Chia Yee.Pang says there are several ways these are applied in Taylor’s degree programmes, such as through group project work as well as work-based learning and internships.“Many students are so used to structured academic life that when things become unpredictable, such as in real-life situations, they go into panic mode, ” she says.“Society has conditioned them for many years to achieve subject scores, which are individual achievements. However, in college and university, we have group work, which they find challenging because many are weak in communication and leadership skills.”She says that these life skills are crucial to tackle life challenges, noting the importance of other emotional quotient (EQ) aspects such as resilience and emotional management.These are part of the Taylor’s Graduate Capabilities (TGC) that students would be assessed on in every module, she says, and Taylor’s students receive a second transcript describing their competency in these areas.Raja Imran Raja Azhar, a lecturer for the Diploma in Design programme at Taylor’s College, says that first of all, soft skills need to be modelled by academics in order for intellectual aspects to be absorbed successfully.“There were some rare occasions when my communication with my students did not synch, but I would find other approaches to hit that ‘jump-start’ button with them, with regard to their assignments.“Sometimes it’s not about the lack in our academic approach, but more about their personality and traits, and I try to encourage them to be more open in discussions, ” says Raja Imran.Having recently won the RISE Educator Award: Taylorian Edition for his pastoral care and engaging manner of teaching, Raja Imran goes out of his way to ensure his students grasp concepts well.He says that with lockdowns and prolonged periods of online learning, he had to be flexible and creative in his approach to teaching and assessment, returning to some old school methods of using paper and recyclable items, as well as making use of students’ own body measurements and spatial awareness.“Students realised that it’s not the expensive materials that boost their model-making appearance. What designers look for at the end of the day are design ideas and constructability, even with just the use of basic materials such as glue, papers and cutter.“As a result, some first semester students achieved jaw-dropping output, ” he says.And while online learning has not stopped academics from nurturing the intellect, it also did not hinder students from engaging in the craft aspect, as Choong reveals.“Students are exposed to multidisciplinary collaborative projects as early as year one via a university-wide social innovation module which makes it compulsory for students to solve real-world problems with students from other programmes, schools or faculties.“Students are inculcated with the ‘fail fast, learn faster’ growth mindset by embracing the practices of making, tinkering and creating, ” says Choong, who is one of two co-directors at Taylor’s Me.reka Makerspace, who directs the university’s academic integration with industry and community impact.Instilling this “maker” mindset throughout the university has reaped benefits for students, Choong says.“Not only is this an effective way of learning, it drives students to create products instead of only consuming them. This mindset spurs innovation by connecting the students with the right tools, inspiration, opportunity and community of makers.”Choong believes that a suitable atmosphere that allows students to experiment, fail and grow and attain the right set of soft skills is a defining experience that prepares students to adapt to an increasingly volatile and complex world.This is, after all, what makes university worthwhile."

Dr April Camilla hopes the award will open up more opportunities for collaboration that will take the fraternity to greater heights.Speaking to StarEdu, she shared that academic surgery has not been an easy path as it demands many sacrifices, mentally, physically and socioeconomically.“In a personal capacity, I feel that my career choice, which has at times been questioned by others, has been vindicated.“Professionally, I am proud that colorectal surgery in Malaysia has gained international recognition.“It is a relatively young specialty here, with a very small number of specialists, particularly in the public sector, ” she said.Despite limited capacity within the field, she added that they are still able to deliver quality care, conduct research and train the next generation.“Imagine what we could do with more resources!”Malaysia has come a long way in establishing structured surgical training, she said, adding that there is, however, much to do. Engagement needs to happen much earlier rather than at the pre-university level, as most of the groundwork for developing cognitive, motor and affective skills need to happen in schools.“With regard to formal surgical training programmes, training of trainers needs to be professionalised, workplace-based assessments strengthened, the effectiveness and efficiency of training increased, and the delivery of quality assured examinations improved.“While virtual learning opportunities cannot completely replace hands-on training, we need to integrate its beneficial elements to reduce the gaps that decentralised training can be subjected to.“The research component in training needs to be recognised as a valuable skill, and not a burden, ” she said.It is also imperative to focus more attention on the well-being of trainees and their trainers in order to mitigate the constant attrition in numbers she said,Dr April Camilla hopes students will spend some time understanding themselves – their strengths and weaknesses, what brings them joy, and what they want out of life.“Then, go for it – whatever ‘it’ is. Be ambitious, but be prepared. Start early, be humble, get help. Embrace hard work, but don’t forget to have joy.”She reminded students to not forget to give back and be the mentor they would have liked to have.“Support your colleagues, your alma mater, your country – there are so many ways to do so, be it contributing your time, expertise or financial support, and it will go a long way to relieving their burdens.”A University of Wales graduate, Dr April Camilla has produced about 80 academic research publications.

"Sunday, 25 Nov 2018",12:00 AM MYT,News,,Words in the news to inspire,"School uses the newspaper to engage students in HIPAT a recent Highly Immersive Programme (HIP) Carnival organised by the Selangor State Education Department in SMK Raja Muda Musa, Selangor, eight schools from six districts – SK Kampung Idaman, SK Binjal, SAM Sg Haji Dorani, SMK Seksyen 4 Kota Damansara, SMK Ampang Pecah, SMK TTDI Jaya and SMK Kuala Selangor – discussed strategies taken by the school administration to achieve its goal of improving English proficiency among students.HIP, which was introduced under the Upholding Bahasa Malaysia and Strengthening English policy, aims to provide a language-rich environment for students to be exposed to the language through various activities within and beyond the classroom.Besides improving English proficiency, it also focuses on inculcating positive behaviour towards learning and using the language.SMK Kuala Selangor English panel head Faridah Kassim shares her experiences in incorporating The Star newspaper and its Newspaper-in-Education (NiE) pullout as part of the school’s Highly Immersive Programme.IN SMK Kuala Selangor, the English language department has carried out many activities under HIP. One of the programmes include our use of the newspaper known as The Star’s NiE pullout.In a quote from her book Quotes with Soul to Make You Feel Whole, Lucille Dass, Star-NiE freelance consultant trainer, states: “Your paper qualifications do not just your credentials make. You are valued mostly according to how you inter-relate and communicate.”In this quote, I believe that the key word here is “communicate”.If “on paper” a student is excellent and shows outstanding grades but is unable to communicate well, the result is not valuable because he will not be able to show for it in life. For example, should this student attend an interview, he will be unable to express his ideas well and hence miss opportunities to better himself.This is a common occurrence because most students these days cannot communicate well. This, in my opinion, is due to the lack of vocabulary in speaking English. This is why the NiE programme is so closely connected to HIP.The newspaper directs students to word exposure. If teachers use the NiE programme in their lessons, students would uncover more words and by doing so, would increase their vocabulary.As a teacher who has used the NiE pullouts in the classroom since 2016, I can vouch that The Star’s NiE programme inspires teachers to be creative in planning their activities.We have used NiE activities suggested in the pullouts and tweaked them to support all types of language-rich activities to create a highly immersive environment in the classroom.We have been fortunate because of a newspaper sponsorship from glove-making company, Hartalega.From this sponsorship, we carried out 21st century teaching and learning lessons. Here, students are divided into teams for group work. To complete tasks, they use materials from the newspaper. The final product is an opportunity to present their outcome in groups.The students in our school are quite familiar with this type of learning methodology because the activities in the Star-NiE pullouts encourage group learning and outcomes. Hence, we have students who are ready to get involved in competitions, especially like the ones organised in the annual Star-NiE contests.Our students are already familiar with the concept of shared learning experiences. This type of learning encourages creativity among students. I am proud to say that through such learning experiences, students from SMK Kuala Selangor clinched the Merit Awards in 2016 and 2018 at the NiE contests, namely, Game 4 Life and Star Flicks.Besides using NiE in the classroom, we use this methodology at our Speaker’s Corner where students carry out one-minute speeches during recess. Each student selects a topic taken from the newspaper and speaks on the issue.The teachers, too, play an active role in the school. They take turns to give one-minute speeches during the assemblies. Even the ustaz and ustazah use the English language during this programme.At co-curriculum activities, NiE is a regular feature during English Camps. Students enjoy expressing their ideas from newspaper articles that pique their interests. They use their creativity to present their findings in groups. These outcomes are displayed at the English Corner at the library which are often referred to by the teachers and students.We would like to thank Hartalega, our newspaper sponsors and The Star for their great support. If you are looking for ideas to spruce up your Highly Immersive Programme in school, Star-NiE is a great tool and resource to turn to!— Faridah Kassim, teacher, SMK Kuala Selangor, Selangor"
"Sunday, 17 Mar 2019",12:00 AM MYT,News,EMILY CHAN,Sharing tips for success,"SK SUBANG Bestari 2 recently opened its doors to SK Sungai Buloh English panel head Nurhafizah Yaacob who shared her experience on using the Step Up education pullout by The Star.The sharing session not only gave teachers new ideas to take home but also forged a good relationship between the two schools located in Selangor.The colourful 24-page workbook-cum-activity English pullout is designed to help pupils in Years Four, Five and Six prepare for the Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) examination.Step Up also features Chinese and Bahasa Malaysia translations of difficult English words.Nurhafizah recounted the days when her school began their subscription of Step Up, which comes with a copy of The Star newspaper.“Pupils brought the newspaper home and their family felt a subtle change. All this while, they’ve never had an English newspaper in the house.“The parents then contacted the school and suggested that teachers help pupils go through Step Up and incorporate it into lessons,” she said.SK Subang Bestari 2 English panel head Nor Shahbinar Kamil, who teaches Year Six pupils, said that the sharing session was informative.“The students in SK Sungai Buloh and SK Subang Bestari 2 more or less share the the same proficiency levels, so Nurhafizah’s ideas are workable.“This enhances our usage of the pullout.“The session has given me new ideas and the teachers here can expand the usage of Step Up. Apart from using it in class, we can also use it outside of the classroom,” she said.Fellow colleague Siti Farah Azuah Nasir said: “It was a very good sharing session! I’m so glad that she came to our school.”“This is a golden opportunity for teachers in this school to get insights to using Step Up efficiently.“Aside from how to use the pullout, we also learned how to fully utilise the copy of The Star newspaper that comes with the pullout. There are so many activities we can do with the newspaper and the pullout,” she said.“It was also a good gathering for English primary school teachers. It helped us expand knowledge in our line of teaching,” she added.SK Subang Bestari 2 headmaster Md Hishamuddin Md Yaacob said he hopes to have more sharing sessions like this.“It benefits both sides. In the future, we can also share our story with other schools. This is a start of a good relationship between our school and SK Sungai Buloh.”He added that he is thankful that The Star facilitated in helping the school improve English Language teaching.“This helped spark more ideas and showed the many ways teachers can use the pullout and newspaper.”For more information about this English language resource for Primary schools, call The Star’s Customer Care Unit at 1-300-88-7827 from Monday to Friday (9am-5pm). Subscription is through schools only.The pullout is endorsed by the Education Ministry."
"Sunday, 08 Mar 2020",,News,,In touch with literature,"LITERATURE provides an avenue for students to derive many lessons, which include looking at things from different perspectives and practising empathy.That is what readers get to do through Trevor Millum’s Sad I Ams poem – a text which is part of the English Language literature component for Form One students. In the poem, one is reminded of discarded items, told through the first-person narration.Activities based on the poem, as well as other literary texts, are available for subscribers of The Star’s Newspaper-in-Education (NiE) pullout, which has an English Literature segment centred on the school syllabus.In the pullout, readers will also find teen writers from our BRATs Young Journalist Programme responding to the literary topics and themes.To obtain the activities and read the students’ response, grab a copy of the NiE pullout on Wednesday, March 11.Published bi-monthly, the NiE pullout offers English language activities, and a writing platform for teens. It is available only through school subscriptions of The Star.To subscribe, call the toll free number 1-300-88-7827 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). For more information on Star-NiE’s BRATs programme, go to facebook.com/niebrats.Read on to get a sampling of our teen writers’ response to the Sad I Ams poem. In their response, they wrote fictional autobiographies as they put themselves in the shoes of inanimate objects.Broken into piecesYOU used to stare so deeply into my eyes. Your hands, soft and gentle, used to stroke me so tenderly. “My love, my everything” was your affectionate murmurs as you fixed your fond gaze upon me.I was your pride, the first thing you showed everyone whenever they came; your joy, the last thing you reached for before you fell asleep. I was your protector of the night, standing on the table with a bouquet of roses beside me, both of us keeping watch over you.One evening, the roses went first. As you threw her into the bin, I could only close my eyes to block out the cries of heartache from the roses. (Or was it from you?)The sobs lasted throughout the night, and for the first time, you didn’t take a single glance at me.“This is only temporary, ” I reassured myself, “how would you ever bear to neglect me, whom you call ‘your love, your everything’?”Still, I was filled with a sense of foreboding. At dawn, the sun cast its scorching rays over the room, creating a reflection of light from my glass frame. I felt your gaze upon me, and beamed with delight as you lifted me up slowly.Suddenly, droplets of water came trickling down across my picture of a handsome man. You no longer wailed like you did last night; now, tears flowed silently down your face.Slowly but certainly, a hint of rage started to creep into your eyes. It struck me then that I would never feel your warm look or kind touch again. The same eyes now glared at me in anger, and the same pair of hands hurled me against the wall.Shattered images of love spilled all over the cold marble floor. There I lay, broken and in pieces.Still, I waited. Day after day, I lay there, waiting to be glued back together by your renewed love. But when you swept me away, I realised I didn’t deserve your love anymore. — Ooi Shinz Jo, 16, Chung Ling Private High School, PenangWorn outALLOW me to introduce myself – I am a blouse, born in a factory in Bangladesh. The seamstresses were very efficient, fashioning my friends and me out of plain cloth without any respite in between.Afterwards, I was packed in a box with a dozen of my friends and loaded onto a lorry, which took us to the airport, where we were delivered to Malaysia.In Malaysia, we were taken to a famous international clothing store in Pavilion Kuala Lumpur, where I was hung on a display rack along with my friends.Lots of people came to this store to check out my friends and me as we were affordable and trendy. After a week at the store, I was finally taken off the rack and landed in the arms of a fashionable teenager. Her name was Clara.Clara was proud of me and wore me whenever she could. She took good care of me, always making sure I wasn’t dirtied or damaged, while she stowed her other clothing deep inside her closet. I never had to wait long to be lifted into her arms. I felt so loved and wanted.One day, while I was on one of my rare breaks, Clara entered her room. In her arms was a new blouse. She hung it next to me. I was glad to make a new friend. Little did I know this new friend would be my curse. From then on, Clara started wearing the new blouse, instead of me.I couldn’t believe the turn of events; I thought I would always be Clara’s favourite. What’s worse, I was eventually tossed to the back of her closet, along with others, to make way for newer, trendier clothes.By and by, we overheard Clara’s mother telling her to do something about us as her closet started to overflow. The next day, Clara took us downstairs and dumped us in the trash can, without so much as a backward glance.We ended up in a landfill, far away from Kuala Lumpur. Her actions broke our hearts, but all we could do was to suffer silently. Unfortunately, it would take me – a polyester blouse – hundreds of years to disappear. This is the consequence of fast fashion. — Dennis Lai Yong Jia, 14, SMK Seri Hartamas, Kuala LumpurCannedI REMEMBER being produced in a shabby, old beverage factory where I was later placed in a box and shipped away. We were delivered to a local gas station and got placed in an arctic-like machine. I got the window seat, together with a few others, who shared my curiosity for the future.Three days later, a teenager came walking in. His name was Dennis Fitch. He observed us from behind the transparent wall for a few seconds. Soon after, he reached out for me.It was an exhilarating moment being held in his hand. Though it made me weaker with his every sip, I was thankful I was the one he chose to quench his thirst. Once we reached his car, I was placed in my very own seat. What a thoughtful person, I thought as we drove off.I envisioned the great life we were going to have. It was going to be like everything I had dreamed of. Fifteen minutes later, I was three-quarters gone. My vessel became fragile and I felt lighter than before.Shortly after, we arrived at our destination. Dennis picked me from my seat as he exited the vehicle and made for the beach. Everything around me was enchanting. The sky was a pastel pink as the sunset hit the water and the sand.Dennis took off his sandals and let the cool water sweep over his feet while he glanced at the distance. I felt blissful in that moment.Out of nowhere, a young girl’s voice broke my reverie. She was calling Dennis’ name. Without hesitation, he dropped me and walked away. As I drifted away from the shore, I stared at Dennis’ receding figure. I received no goodbye, not a backward glance, nor a final sip. — Tasshyea P.K. Sivakumaran, 18, Sunway College, Subang Jaya, SelangorA life of serviceSOMETIME in December 2010, two young girls waltzed into a uniform store with their parents. The mother asked the worker at the store to bring out some samples of white baju kurung.It was back-to-school season. I was a highly sought-after product. The lady asked for two pairs of baju kurung for each of her daughters, both in small sizes because of her children’s petite physiques.I was placed in a bag alongside other articles that looked identical to me. The amount of excitement I felt was indescribable.The girl I served turned out to be the younger daughter, who was only six. Her mother placed me on the ironing board to rid me of any creases, ensuring her child would look fresh and clean on her first day in school.The young girl seemed nervous while getting dressed, staring at herself in the mirror, afraid of the challenges ahead. She grabbed her backpack and put on her white slip-on shoes.Right before she headed out the door, she took one last look in the mirror. This time, her nervousness had dissolved, replaced by a look of determination on her face. This was a new beginning, a new chapter that she couldn’t wait to start, and she knew that I’d be there with her every step of the way.I served my owner for three full years, until the day her mother put me into a plastic bag along with other pieces to be donated. My young owner went through the bag and took one last look at me, reminiscing about all the memories we had lived through together.Like the time she got a sticker from her teacher for having the best drawing in class, or the time she fell down in the school’s parking lot while chasing her friend, and tore a small part of me which had to be sewn up.It was a bittersweet journey to say the least, but I was ready to serve another young one. I was ready for my new life. — Firza Azureen Ridzuan, 16, SMK Puteri Titiwangsa, Kuala Lumpur"

It’s how you acclimatise to different environments and manage yourself.“Do mix around as it is the only time to experience other people’s culture.”Star Media Group’s Ng receiving the mock sponsorship cheque from Raiha and Satiful (right).The awards were presented to the recipients by Terengganu state executive council member in charge of education Satiful Bahri Mamat.The 40 Terengganu students were among 400 selected from a total of over 7,355 applicants nationwide.This year, a total of RM156mil was allocated for the sponsorship.Petronas is also adopting 10 trust schools in Terengganu – five each in Kijal and Marang – from 2017 to 2021.The trust school programme by Petronas is a tie-up between Yaya­san Amir and the Education Ministry.Introduced in 2015, the Trenglish (Transforming English in Tereng­ganu) programme, involving 50 schools in the state, is a collaborative effort between the oil and gas company with the state education department and Yayasan Tereng­ganu.Trenglish aims to increase Eng­lish language proficiency among the students.As an added boost, Petronas is sponsoring RM150,000 worth of The Star’s Newspaper-in-Education (NiE) pullout to supplement the programme for the third year.Star Media Group chief content officer Esther Ng received the mock cheque at the event.Written by a team of experienced English language specialists, the NiE pullout is packed with engaging hands-on newspaper activities for the classroom.As supplements to the Petronas’ sponsorship, four NiE workshops are included – two for teachers and two for students – for a more effective use of newspapers in the classroom.One of the recipients, Muhammad Adib Rusydi Mohd Zawawi from Imtiaz Kuala Berang, said that NiE and Trenglish had helped him tremendously as the interview with Petronas was held in English."

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,Opinion,WONG CHUN WAI,Shot in the foot,"It’s so easy to pull the trigger on despatching ‘news’, but what if fact meets fiction?A POPULAR piece of fake news making the rounds is the one involving two top business personalities and a valuer.Their names need no mentioning to add more credence to the rumour but suffice to say, I know all three personally.Two of them succumbed to Covid-19 or complications arising from their infection.If you want to believe these spreaders, who are more infectious than Covid-19, all three were seated together at an annual dinner.Facts tell us that companies have not held dinner events in the past 12 months.The three of them were never together and attended no such event. When it was well refuted, the rumour took a new twist, like a variant, saying the three turned up at a Chinese organisation gathering. A new name even emerged!The incredible part is that a lot of people believed the rumours, including those who are well-connected and could have easily verified it themselves.But it would be fair to say that they also forwarded the message with little thought.A few who checked with me even dismissed my explanation with cynicism, despite me stressing that one was a school mate and that I have professional relationships with the other two Tan Sri.Last week, tuition teacher Mohd Nazaruddin Yusoff, 50, pleaded not guilty to posting fake news on Facebook at the Sessions Court in Johor Baru. His alleged offence is understood to be the first case since the Emergency Ordinance came into effect in March.He allegedly claimed a traffic policeman died after receiving his second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.In Kangar, Perlis, Norjannah Rusli, 28, was fined RM5,000, in default of five months’ jail, by the Kangar Sessions Court after she pleaded guilty to spreading fake news about the pandemic via WhatsApp, with the intention of striking fear and concern among the public.The offence was allegedly committed at a house in Jalan Pauh, Kampung Belukar, Arau, at 10.31am on April 18.The charge was framed under Section 4(1) of the Emergency Ordinance (Essential Powers) (No.2) 2021, which carries a maximum fine of RM100,000 or a jail term of up to three years, or both.These peddlers of false news care little for the consequences of their actions, especially the emotional scars they leave. While public figures are immune to fake news, especially on social media, not everyone can handle it.Another recent fake news involved a man running amok at a vaccination centre in an East Coast state. But it’s, in fact, an old video of an angry man with mental illness, and nothing concerning vaccination.Even seasoned politicians have become victims of false claims, including certain political leaders who seem to take great joy in attacking the government, only to slip and fall on their own rhetoric.I must confess that even I, as a reporter, have believed some of the fake news, including one about a list to approve essential services from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).I’m fortunate that I can verify it with my colleagues and government officials, but most Malaysian don’t have that privilege.It’s also unfair for government officials to spend their time rebutting fake news, which seems to have gone into overdrive.There are also politicians who use their positions to make allegations and cause untold damage, especially if they speak at the Dewan Rakyat, where they are exempt from defamation.And if they’re popular opposition leaders, many tend to believe what they say because they seem to be more trustworthy than government Members of Parliament.Their victims choose not to file legal action against these politicians because court cases take up too much time and are costly affairs.One university official was accused of money laundering by a politician without evidence, and the poor woman had no chance to even explain herself.It has taken an emotional toll on her, but those who hurl accusations don’t seem to care. If there was any evidence, the best way would be to file a complaint with the relevant authorities.Social media has been a boon as well as bane. It’s become the fastest way to disseminate information, but it’s also a platform to spread fake news which can create discord.Anyone and everyone can be a reporter now, but the only difference is that the recognised media is trained to check and verify news. In terms of speed, we lose out sometimes, but our principle has always been that in case of doubt, leave it out.Knowing my background as a reporter engaged in print, online and social media, clients sometimes tell me that they only swear by advertising in social media.But when they run into trouble, they quickly run to the old school journalists for help. The pimply key influencers, with their legion of followers, become completely inept at crisis management.The point is this – don’t be too quick to forward your so-called news. Check with reputable and credible news organisations, and not half-baked news sites and paid bloggers.Or worse, the neighbourhood rumour mongers who claim to know everything. So, forward at your own peril."
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,Opinion,PHILIP GOLINGAI,Remembering a key moment in Sabah’s history,"FORTY-FIVE years ago today, a Nomad N-22B aircraft that had entered Kota Kinabalu airport airspace began a one-and-a-half-turn spiral plummet that ended in disaster. The plane, which had departed from Labuan, crashed into shallow waters off the coast of Kampung Sembulan Baru, Kota Kinabalu.Killed in the tragedy on June 6,1976, was the crème de la crème of Berjaya, which had been led by its president, Tun Fuad Stephens, to victory over Usno just two months before in the Sabah state election. The dead were Tun Fuad (Sabah Chief Minister), Datuk Peter Mojun-tin (Local Government and Housing Minister), Datuk Salleh Sulong (Finance Minister), Chong Thain Vun (Communications and Works Minister) and Darius Binion (assistant to the Chief Minister).Others who also perished were Datuk Wahid Peter Andu (permanent secretary to the Finance Ministry), Syed Hussein Wafa (director of the Economic Planning Unit), Johari (Fuad’s son), Captain Gandhi Nathan (pilot), Corporal Said Mohammad (bodyguard) and Ishak Atan (Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah’s executive assistant).Two Australian-made Nomad N-22B aircraft had flown out of Labuan where federal and state leaders had met to discuss oil royalties. The other plane carried noted politicians like Finance Minister Tengku Razaleigh, Sarawak Chief Minister Tun Abdul Rahman Ya’kub and Sabah deputy chief minister Tun Harris Salleh, who would later replace Tun Fuad as chief minister.Today, it will be a quiet memorial for the “double six” tragedy, which remains a mystery among Sabahans who have many conspiracy theories about it.Sabah NGO Sunduvan has been organising a commemoration ceremony on June 6 every year since the tragedy; it will be a virtual one this year because of the current movement control order phase.According to Sunduvan chairman Aloysius Danim Siap, the tragedy is significant because it is linked to the petroleum agreement between the Sabah government and Kuala Lumpur.“The agreement was signed a week after the plane crash that killed Tun Fuad and three other state Cabinet ministers as well as key state government officials at the time, ” he said.The double six crash is also significant because among the dead was Peter Mojuntin, 37, who came to be immortalised in a 1978 book titled Peter J. Mojuntin: The Golden Son of the Kadazan by Bernard Sta Maria. However, the Malaysian government banned the book on the Moyog assemblyman who held the state seat in the Penampang parliamentary constituency.Peter’s nephew, Petrus Conrad, wants the ban to be lifted: “It’s high time our younger generation got to know the political history of Sabah during that period, ” he said.As a Kadazan from Penampang, I have my own memories of the legend. I remember an anecdote that illustrates why Peter was often called the people’s politician – supposedly Peter ate a dish of nonsom (a Kadazan preserved delicacy) a villager had served him even though it had giuk (worms) in it. Somehow this story that I heard three or four decades ago has stuck in my mind.I asked Petrus whether the story was true.“This is a story related to me by my mother, Theresa Bajerai. On my uncle’s campaign trail in remote Kudat, during lunchtime he was served nonsom bakas (preserved wild boar with rice and salt). He saw there were some giuk. He said the people there ate it, so he ate it too, as giuk is full of protein, ” Petrus related.Petrus also said his uncle was a gifted orator: “When he gave a speech, he spoke boldly and fierily, and everybody would listen closely.”To get an insight into Peter and the double six tragedy, I sent some questions to his brother, Datuk Conrad Mojuntin, Petrus’ father.Conrad believes the crash was connected to the oil royalties negotiation. He related one of the famous conspiracy theories many Sabahans believe, that an officer in Kota Kinabalu airport’s control tower did not now allow the plane to land, instructing it to circle a few times.Conspiracy theorists also love to share a video supposedly of Tengku Razaleigh explaining what happened minutes before the aircraft flew out of Labuan airport.In the video titled Oil for Who? uploaded in 2010 to the now defunct website razaleigh.com, Razaleigh is heard telling audience in a community hall in Penampang near Kota Kinabalu: “When talking about oil and Sabah I cannot help but remember a sad incident which happened to Sabah and Sabahans.“I myself had boarded the plane. We were all strapped in – wearing seat belts – on the plane. I sat behind Tun Fuad Stephens, and on my right was (Sarawak’s Chief Minister) Rahman, and behind me was the Tengku Bendahara Pahang, ” said the then Finance Minister.“Suddenly, Harris Salleh, who was Sabah deputy chief minister, asked me to exit the plane as he said it is better that we go [in the second aircraft] to Pulau Banggi to see a cattle ranch.”I asked Conrad, who was 28 years old in 1976, why he thinks Peter became a legend. He replied that it’s because his brother was willing to die for his people.“He was fighting for freedom of religion and basic human rights, specifically that the Kadazan people should be treated equally, ” he said.For me, the double six tragedy represents the what-ifs of Sabah history. The air crash killed Sabah leaders who had been seen as a new hope for the state.How different would Sabah have been if Peter or the other Berjaya leaders like Tun Fuad, Darius Binion, and Salleh Sulong hadn’t died? Would Sabah have agreed to receive only 5% royalties for its oil? Would Sabah have given away Labuan as a federal territory?“Sabah would never have agreed to 5%. Labuan would not have been given away, ” said Conrad, who replaced his brother as the Moyog assemblyman in a by-election in 1976, eventually becoming Sabah minister for Culture, Youth and Sport.If Sabah had got 20% oil rights, would its political and economic history be different?"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,Opinion,THE STAR SAYS,Malaysians must do their part,"ALMOST one week has gone by since a full lockdown was imposed but the number of new Covid-19 cases and deaths are still significantly high.By next Monday, with the end of two weeks of full movement control order phase, these numbers are unlikely to change by much, say experts.To date Malaysia has breached the 600,000 mark of Covid-19 cases, since March 18 last year, when the pandemic was declared. There have been more than 3,000 deaths related to this disease reported in hospitals nationwide throughout this period.A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in the United States recently revealed the Covid-19 death toll in this country may reach a staggering 26,000 by September, based on the current trajectory, if Malaysia doesn’t bring the number of infections down significantly.If not, this means in the next three months another 23,000 Malaysians could die – an average of 250 deaths a day.Despite these grim figures, many Malaysians still had a lackadaisical attitude towards the SOP designed to fight the virus.For instance, we hear daily of people being caught for not wearing masks in public.And our roads are still busy despite most shops and shopping complexes being closed for business nationwide. Where are all these people going?Malaysians need to ask themselves how much longer we can endure this situation that is bringing the economy to its knees.The country’s financial health is also not in the best state, with statutory debt expected to hit 58.5% of GDP this year, coming in at RM975bil.While the government does its best, pouring billions into aid for those who have lost jobs and preventing more businesses from folding, Malaysians must also do their part to reduce the infection rate.This is every individual’s responsibility as we are running out of time with the country’s reserves depleting and our healthcare system stretched to breaking point.Other than staying home and strictly following the SOP when in public, we have to achieve herd immunity against this disease by getting 80% of the population vaccinated by the end of this year.While health authorities are boosting vaccination rate from 100,000 doses daily now to 200,000 shots by next month, Malaysians must do their part by registering for vaccination and more importantly, turning up for their appointments.We must not just flash the trendy #KitaJagaKita hashtag on social media but also play our part to get ourselves out of this pandemic.Stay safe, stay home, and get vaccinated!"
"Wednesday, 02 Jun 2021",,Opinion,JUNE H.L. WONG,Lessons from a derailed chairman,"WELCOME to my month. Can you believe half the year has gone, seemingly at lightning speed?Talking of lightning speed, that’s how fast the Finance Ministry removed Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman as Prasarana Malaysia Bhd chairman. It was simply unprecedented.Undoubtedly, it was public outrage at its best and most effective in getting the ministry to give the boorish Pasir Salak MP the sack.Yes, we are angry. But Malaysians have been angry and frustrated long before the pandemic struck. And those feelings stemmed from how many politicians, especially those in power, act and speak.The disdain for the common folk, the sense of entitlement and privilege they seem to think they have a right to, the arrogance and belief in their invincibility that makes corruption almost endemic and acceptable, playing to their gallery with racist rants – the list is endless.Tajuddin ticked almost every box, and the last straw was his now infamous press conference in the aftermath of the May 24 LRT train crash.Everyone who watched it was shocked and revulsed by his obvious incompetence, lack of knowledge of the situation, and zero sympathy for the victims. One came away feeling that he thought paying RM1,000 in compensation and taking care of the victims’ medical bills were all that mattered and would settle everything.It was plain that this man, elected to represent the people, had no idea how to do that.And Malaysians, already tired and stressed out by the resurgence of Covid-19 infections, were in no mood to be nice, even about something unrelated to the pandemic. Everyone wanted him gone. And he was, the very next day.It was laughable that former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak thought it was up to Umnoto decide when Tajuddin should resign. The Perikatan Nasional coalition government, aware of the strong public sentiment, obviously thought otherwise.Well, good for them.Tajuddin serves as a classic example of a political appointee who absolutely did not deserve, nor was qualified for, the position he was given. It’s no secret that there are many more like him who gotplum jobs heading government-linked companies (GLCs) based on political expediency.Tajuddin’s self-inflicted implosion pulled the lid off such appointments, prompting Umno’s Datuk Seri Mohamed Nazri Abdul Aziz to ask the Perikatan government to remove other “problematic” political appointees.Nazri, the Padang Rengas MP and a former minister, is no stranger to controversy himself. But he is also known for his bluntness.He was quoted as saying: “He [Tajuddin] is not the only one. There are many others and I think there is no need for me to mention names.” (Oh Nazri, do name names, please!)He added: “The same action must be taken [against] them, too. Don’t be selective. I mean, really. We are talking about wanting to be a clean government and we must do our level best to comply with what the rakyat wants.”Yes, indeed. How many more such leeches can this country bear? Ours is a nation blessed with natural beauty, resources and a strategic location, safe from natural disasters like typhoons and volcanic eruptions. We also have lots of talented and intelligent people, but why does it feel that it isn’t properly reflected in many of our institutions and the corridors of power?But like I said, we the people are in no mood to play nice when we are suffering from a crisis of epic proportions. That’s why badly- behaving ministers, MPs and GLC appointees are not getting away with anything anymore. The same goes for anyone who thinks he or she is above the law, including so-called VIPs and celebrities.Popular as they are, actress Neelofa and singer Siti Nurhaliza could not escape being shamed and punished when they violated the pandemic standard operating procedure.Ironically, their transgressions were openly posted on social media. It was as if they thought their fans would be thrilled to see how privileged they are and the authorities would indulge them.Currently, the police are investigating allegations on social media that an unnamed minister was stopped at a roadblock in Perasing, Kemaman, Terengganu, on May 16 without a valid interstate travel document.Let’s see how that unfolds.With that in mind, everyone had better behave. We are all linked together in this pandemic that has sickened and killed many and wreaked havoc on people’s livelihoods and the economy.This time last year, we were coming out of a conditional movement control order and moving into recovery. We thought we had succeeded in taming the virus. But like many other countries, our hopes were premature. Many governments wanting to appease their citizens eased restrictions too quickly and SARS-CoV-2 went on to mutate into variants that were more infectious and deadly.We made the same mistake in April by allowing Ramadan bazaars to operate.According to online portal FMT, Bersatu party insiders admitted “We were giving in to everyone without really thinking of the consequences. We caved in to pressure, not wanting to upset the traders, hoping for their support in return.”The result was that bazaars became one of the main reasons for the huge surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, added FMT. We have paid a terrible price for our impatience and lack of political will.And so the total lockdown that we dreaded began yesterday.This time around, if we have any hope of quelling the virus and its infection rates, we must once again strictly abide by the SOP.There will be the inevitable violators, whether by design or accident. But let’s not see ministers or celebrities or other VIPs among them. They should use their elevatedstatus to be role models for their admirers and supporters to follow and not be figures of disappointment and ridicule.From last year’s experience, two weeks was too short and the MCO was extended.Hopefully this time, it’s enough because we have the additional weapon of mass vaccinations which are finally shaping up well. I had my first jab this afternoon.If our leaders keep a steady hand on the tiller and steer enough of us to collectively do the right thing – adhere to the SOP, stay home, and vaccinate – over the next few months, then we have a good chance of saving Deepavali and Christmas 2021 and being able to safely balik kampung for Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Gawai Dayak and Kaamatan 2022.The views expressed here are entirely the writer’s own."

"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",8:41 AM MYT,StarPicks,,An icon of innovative rejuvenation,"HISTORY was made at London’s Battersea Power Station (BPS) recently after the much-loved landmark – which is at the heart of a £9bil (RM52.8bil) regeneration project – opened the doors to its first-ever residents.Homeowners received their keys following the completion of Switch House West, the Power Station’s first major element. The rest of the building will follow in stages, with the Boiler House and Switch House East set to welcome new residents in the coming months.The Grade II* listed former coal-fired power station had laid dormant and derelict for decades after decommissioning in the 1980s, but is undergoing a major transformation to restore and repurpose it for modern use.It will be the crown jewel and focal point of a 42-acre (17ha) mixed-used development located on a former industrial brownfield site on the southern banks of the River Thames – which is regarded as one of the best urban regeneration projects not just in England, but all of Europe.It is jointly developed by Malaysia’s S P Setia Bhd, the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Sime Darby Property Bhd, under a consortium known as Battersea Power Station Development Co Ltd.Besides adaptive reuse of the Power Station, the masterplan also sees the creation of new residential, cultural and event spaces interspersed with community facilities and serviced by a Zone 1 extension to the London Underground’s Northern Line.There will be over 3mil sq ft of commercial spaces, including several hundred shops, cafes and restaurants, a theatre, hotel and medical centre. 19 acres of the site will be dedicated to public space, including a six-acre (2.4ha) park and 450m of river frontage.Once complete, it will be one of London’s most vibrant neighbourhoods and business quarters. An estimated 25,000 people will live and work here, serving as the anchor for the Vauxhall, Nine Elms and Battersea Opportunity Area.This exciting premise makes BPS a worthy Gold Award winner under the Masterplan Category of the FIABCI World Prix d’Excellence Awards 2021.A transformative journeyWhile the overall BPS masterplan was designed by Rafael Viñoly, each phase of the development was also shaped by the innovative ideas and visions of a range of specialist architects.Circus West Village has drawn millions of visitors since it opened its doors in 2017. The first phase is now home to more than 1,500 residents and includes facilities such as an entertainment room, cafe, spa and a gym.The Power Station is now nearing completion, and its 253 new homes are among the finest in the city. A truly modern, mixed-used building that belies its utilitarian past, it is also house Apple’s new UK Campus.The public facilities will open next year and include a 2,000-capacity event space, cinemas, office spaces and open piazzas. There will also be over 100 shops and F&B offerings, including an 18,500sq ft food hall, housed in the historic turbine halls.Also notable is the Chimney Lift Experience, to be operated by global events and entertainment leader IMG.A glass elevator transporting visitors 109m up inside one of the Power Station’s chimneys, it tops off with 360° views of the English capital’s skyline.“Naturally, transforming a Grade II* listed brick building that was never originally designed to be inhabited comes with its own challenges. We worked closely with all parties involved, including the architects and Historic England, to ensure it is brought back to life most sensitively and respectfully.“The building was on the UK’s ‘Risk Register’ before development started, which meant it was so badly decayed that it was at risk of further deterioration potentially beyond the point of return.“We had to source over 1.7 million new bricks from the original quarries and rebuild all four iconic chimneys using the exact same building methods used to construct them in the past.“Though challenging, it had always been our top priority to restore the Power Station to its original glory whilst retaining as much of its original essence as possible. Its heritage and history are deeply important and significant, ” said Simon Murphy, CEO of Battersea Power Station Development Company.The primary design goal was to reinforce the Power Station as the site’s main architectural feature by setting it in a formal space defined by a reflecting pool and open views to and from the Thames and its north bank.The development will also evolve with London’s new focus on sustainability. The mass of all new buildings were iteratively adjusted based on sun studies to ensure that all spaces will benefit from maximum daylight and views.Simultaneously, the forms of each new structure were also developed to support both passive cooling and user-controlled enclosures.This – together with a Combined Cooling, Heating and Power (CCHP) system on-site that links to a series of small plants feeding into surrounding residential buildings – makes BPS one of the largest, low-carbon developments in Europe.“Given its history and iconic status, BPS has all the makings to become a top cultural destination in London. It has gained significant interest, especially among arts and culture-fond Londoners, in the past few years following several successful pop-ups and events.“Both Circus West Village and the Power Station have a carefully curated list of retailers and operators to keep it entirely new, experiential and distinct from other retail destinations in London. The following phases will also see a good mix of upscale and high-street brands, ” added Murphy.An exciting futureDatuk Ahmad Pardas Senin, chairman of Battersea Project Holding Company, said, “As custodians of this globally significant building, this is indeed a proud day for Malaysia and the consortium of shareholders.“A new lease of life has been given to this historic building as restoration of its landmark features and transformation into a sustainable development will make it a highly sought-after address.”On the horizon is Phase 3A that includes Battersea Prospect Place, which will be renowned Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry’s first residential space in the UK. Its buildings will all have access to a private garden, and each home comes with its own winter terrace.There is also Battersea Roof Gardens, designed by prominent British architecture firm Foster + Partners. It comprises a mix of apartments and a new hotel with a rooftop swimming pool, bar and restaurant.Finally, there is Electric Boulevard. Conceptualised as London’s most exciting new high street, it will be home to world-class bars and restaurants, as well as flagship stores for some of the finest British and international brands.Battersea Power Station Development Company chairman Datuk Wong Tuck Wai added, “Strong progress continues to be made across the entire project, and we are delighted to see the Malaysian Vision for this thriving new London neighbourhood now becoming a reality. Congratulations to the team who had worked relentlessly to see this through, especially during this challenging Covid-19 pandemic period.”Visit batterseapowerstation.co.uk for details about the development, or follow @BatterseaPwrStn on social media for updates."

"Wednesday, 02 Jun 2021",9:42 AM MYT,StarPicks,,Making smarter saving and spending choices,"Since the start of the pandemic and with various measures to restrict movements, consumers have been going online to shop for their daily needs and wants. Many studies have also indicated that this behaviour shift (to online shopping) is likely to continue even post pandemic.Coupled with the economic impact Malaysia is facing, we have seen a growing interest in Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) as a payment option which offers consumers another way to manage their expenditure.Adopting BNPL as a payment option is an increasing trend globally, the option is widely offered by retailers worldwide and online sites.In Malaysia, BNPL options are also appearing across different retail industries such as fashion, travel, electronics and gadgets – as an alternative payment method with zero-interest fee.But the availability of BNPL services has raised concerns that many consumers may be caught in this new debt trap in the long term.Therefore, when paying with a BNPL service, consumers should plan their shopping and evaluate if the item they intend to buy is a “need” or a “want, ” and spend wisely according to their preferences and budget.They should also find out more about the different BNPL options available and decide what would work best for their respective financial situations.What is PayLater?PayLater by Grab is the latest payment option that allows eligible consumers to purchase and spread their payments to manage their cash flow.Under this latest feature, consumers have a more flexible payment option:This means consumers can shop online now and choose to pay next month or in four monthly instalments. For instance, instead of paying RM2,000 for an electronic device, shoppers can split the bill into four monthly-instalments with no interest charged.Why PayLater?Completely interest-free and with no extra fees when you pay on time.A whole range of features, like auto deduct bills, to help you stay on top of all your spending.Can be used for your Grab spending too, to consolidate monthly Grab spends into one bill and pay next month.No upfront costs.Therefore, through PayLater, consumers can shop for things they need and want like electronic gadgets, clothes, baby milk powder and kitchen appliances in a more transparent manner, while prioritising privacy and security to avoid any risk of fraudulent transactions.Some of the ways Grab helps to protect consumer’s wallets is through a 6-digit pin code, partnerships with globally recognised security systems with award winning fraud detection tools which is complemented with a strong in-house fraud and security team that adopts robust processes and customised algorithms to prevent and detect fraud. Grab has also set up a safety centre in the app to educate and keep consumers updated on how their personal information and wallets are protected.Is BNPL for everyone?It depends. While BNPL is a convenient option for consumers, it is important to exercise discretion on when to utilise it. Some key things to consider before any purchase:Do I need this, or want it?Can I afford this even with an instalment plan?Have I bought anything else in installments?BNPL can help you get that sofa you really want, but deciding if it is within the monthly budget even with BNPL, is essential. In short, BNPL services like PayLater can be considered as a budget management tool to reduce total liabilities!Conclusion, BNPL services aren’t all that bad, especially when we understand what the options are, and how it fits into our lifestyles.For more information on PayLater by Grab, visit https://www.grab.com/my/finance/pay-later/"
"Tuesday, 01 Jun 2021",8:15 AM MYT,StarPicks,,Making sense of the complexities of media and communications,"IN increasingly convoluted times and a perpetually evolving world, communication has become – more than ever – an important part of society.Monash University Malaysia’s Master of Communications and Media Studies (MCMS) co-ordinator Dr Tan Meng Yoe (pic) provides insights into the programme and relevance of communications and media studies in an increasingly complex world:“Communications is more than what is presented to us. We are inundated with media content from various sources, both solicited and unsolicited.“Looking beyond the noise, we must find out what’s really going on. It is in this process of inquiry where important critical thinking skills are developed. In news, we have to ask: whose agenda is prioritised, how stories are framed, what version of reality is laid out for us, who’s behind it, and whether it is useful or dangerous.“These are not easy questions, but with some training, they’re not impossible to answer either.“This can be applied to all avenues of communication. The key is to look beyond the obvious, and identify the contexts, structures and processes that make communication effective – or ineffective.”Thinking beyond ourselves“An important aspect of honing communication skills is broadening our knowledge and appreciation of a world beyond the familiar. This is more crucial than we think it is.“For example, whenever an advertisement receives backlash for insensitivity towards particular cultures or people groups, it is important to realise it is a result of collective ignorance indicating a lack of broader understanding of other cultures.“To be fair, it is impossible to know everything there is to know about everyone, and mistakes do happen. As such, the solution is to develop an ‘others-centered’ approach to making decisions.“Students enrolled in the MCMS programme are exposed to cultural issues within Malaysia and abroad. Due to the diverse demographic of students in the university, students also get to learn and work with people of various backgrounds and nationalities, adapting to different styles.”Learning and producing knowledge“Accumulating knowledge and widening one’s perspective is important, but taking it to the next level, MCMS students conduct original research and contribute to the knowledge pool.“Enrolling in the MCMS degree helps you develop an in-depth, nuanced understanding of the changing global contexts of media and communication practices, and guides you through key issues affecting the communications industry today.“The programme trains you in research methods and theories, besides exploring the challenges that digital technologies, geopolitics and cross-cultural interactions pose in the Asian region.“You may also choose to put your classroom learning into practice through an internship as an elective. In the final semester, you can choose to work on an industry research project.“Alternatively, you can choose to write a dissertation, which represents an opportunity to pursue research that contributes significantly to your chosen field of study and can potentially lead to future doctoral research.”What MCMS offersThe MCMS is specifically crafted to cater to the needs of working professionals, especially in the media and communications industries.A key strength of the programme is the flexibility and support it provides to working students. Running in both full-time and part-time options, the course allows you to pick up a postgraduate qualification without compromising on career progression or work experience.In dialogue with your accomplished peers and lecturers, you will be encouraged to actively reflect and draw on your own work experiences to inform classroom discussions, and also strengthen your professional network.The MCMS degree offers you the opportunity to finely hone the critical thinking and collaborative skills indispensable to success in the industry, and broadens your understanding of cultural contexts. The specialised training will leave you well placed to lead in diverse fields. The career-focused programme uniquely blends an internationally recognised curriculum, collaborative learning from leading experts, independent research, and cutting-edge cultural insight to help you advance both personally and professionally.To learn more about postgraduate coursework and research programmes at Monash, join its Virtual Postgraduate Day on June 26 (2pm).

I believe great photographs, and the stories behind them, have the power to save species and the habitats they need to survive.“I’m doing all I can to bring awareness to the beauty and wonder right here on Planet Earth. Now, how about you?” he said.To this end, OPPO would like to invite you to capture the one thing you would like to preserve until 2121 and participate in its Malaysia Future Photography Contest from which ends June 25. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.Here are some photography know-how using the OPPO Find X3 Pro to get you started:1. Capturing detailsTaking close-ups is a wonderful way of showcasing the incredible details of nature – be it our national flower the hibiscus or interestingly shaped foliage like the venus flytrap – the microlens on the FindX3 Pro can magnify the object up to 60 times, capturing the intricacy not visible to the naked eye.2. Shoot in the best lightMost nature photography would be outside in natural light, and a specific time of day could make the photos more captivating. When the sun is low in the sky, the golden hour can create a magical moment, like dappled light through trees.3. Perfect exposure with AI Highlight videoGood photos require the right amount of exposure. Although one can prevent overexposure when taking the photo by tapping the screen to lock in the focus or swipe up or down to adjust the exposure, opting for an advanced phone could prevent post-production difficulties.The AI Highlight Video feature of the FindX3 Pro automatically switches between Ultra-Night Video and Live HDR – adapting to real-life light conditions, and allowing for worry-free videography.4. Ultra-wide angle lensHow to make your main subject stand out when photographing a cluttered or dark background? Lying on the ground or shooting from a very low angle is always worth trying!However, with the 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera of FindX3 Pro, the free-form surface lens adds complexity to the design and allows light directions to be controlled more precisely – producing zero distortion and correct temperature consistency images.5. Edit carefully with AI PaletteNow it's time for the most important part – the editing. It requires skill to find the right feel while using the right adjustments will enhance the image. The AI Palettes on the FindX3 Pro can learn the colour profile of any picture on your phone and turn it into a custom filter without the need of downloading third party apps – creating professionally edited images in just a few taps.6. Composition is importantGreat photographs always tell a story. Beautiful landscapes, animals or bodies of water all require great composition and a great one draws attention to your main subject. Try using empty space to emphasise your subject.When taking the smartphone for a spin, it's 30W AirVOOC wireless charging – that can fully charge the phone in just 80 minutes – coupled with 65W SuperVOOC 2.0 wired flash charging, would come in handy during breaks.Furthermore, its 0.35mm ultra-thin vapour chamber runs across the motherboard and battery areas, ensuring energy-efficient through encouraging heat dissipation.One of the first to be powered by Qualcomms – a new flagship Snapdragon 888 processor that supports 5G connectivity – the smartphone’s most exciting feature is the collaboration between OPPO and award-winning composer Hans Zimmer that made its ringtones, notifications and alarms specifically for the FindX3 Pro.Want to be in the running to win attractive prizes? Be sure to only use the hashtag #TheStarXOPPO to enter the competition.Interested to learn more about FindX3 Pro?

"Monday, 31 May 2021",8:15 AM MYT,Business,,Facilitating borderless business growth,"MORE than ever, companies must heed the pressing call to go beyond borders to seek opportunities within markets that possess strong potential for growth.Despite uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated economic repercussions, overseas markets such as Asia remain key to growth.As trade tensions between the United States (US) and China continue, companies are eyeing countries in Southeast Asia to establish or expand their sourcing, selling or operations within the next six to 12 months.In addition, positive progress for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will eliminate tariffs on 91% of goods and introduce rules on investment and intellectual property to promote free trade, enable wider market access and in turn, fuel an increase in trade volumes within the Asian trade corridor.According to Standard Chartered’s Borderless Business study, Malaysia is ranked as the second most favourable country in the region for European and US companies, having attracted RM81.9bil in foreign direct investment for 2021 thus far, as compared to RM64.2bil in 2020.That said, Standard Chartered Malaysia’s corporate, commercial and institutional banking client coverage head Mak Joon Nien highlights a shift in the key priorities and concerns of corporations when entering new markets.He shared, “In the past, sourcing funding and managing liquidity, as well as managing foreign exchange risks, would be key concerns. What’s interesting is that we’re now seeing understanding regulations and building relationships with suppliers and supply chain logistics as emerging priorities.The survey revealed that 35% of all the survey’s respondents cite understanding regulations as the number one challenge, while also listing working capital optimisation as a key concern.“A lot of businesses are challenged by market regulations, so you do get a lot of situations where they have an under-optimised balance sheet and there’s a lot of trapped cash in their export markets. Also, a real risk of liquidity impact from the failure of supply chains, which the pandemic has really amplified,” he added.To succeed internationally thus requires expert navigation of both local and international cross-border challenges that have been further complicated by the pandemic.In this regard, financial institutions (FIs) with a global presence can play a facilitating role in easing access to unfamiliar markets and alleviating such challenges their clients face.It is crucial for businesses to have a banking partner that understands global regulations and challenges, not just what’s happening domestically. FIs can help to fund international growth amid market volatility and liquidity constraints,As the only international bank present in all 10 Asean countries with presence in two-thirds of the Belt and Road markets, Standard Chartered is able to appreciate the nuances and diversity of the local markets that it plays in and is thus able to provide its clients with a ‘one bank’ experience through ease of access to expertise, products and services worldwide.This is invaluable for companies looking to expand across geographical borders, as they can take advantage of its global network, while leveraging the bank’s lending products and other innovative finance solutions to execute complex international operations.In doing so, Standard Chartered helps local companies - or those interested to expand into Malaysia - grow their footprint and engage in trade in new markets they have set their sights on, by providing end-to-end solutions for efficient capital transmission and reducing the cost of managing funds.The bank also helps connect clients with the relevant local government bodies to navigate the regulatory landscape in new markets, leveraging its expertise to help clients unlock trapped cash in new markets and working with them on solutions to digitalise their supply chains.As for advice to businesses keen to build resilience, Mak stressed the importance of digitalisation, particularly the use of blockchain, big data and analytics in boosting efficiency, creating wealth, as well as increasing security of trade and overcoming fraud.The pandemic has also strengthened focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) elements, as companies that have adopted good ESG practices have proven to be resilient in times of crisis.“The corporate landscape as we know it has changed dramatically.

It has the ability to capture the image of a QR code, then translates that image into necessary information such as the location and time of the image capture.“It then transfers that information to a centralised database where it gets processed, stored and hopefully then, be used to track and trace those who have been in close contact with infected people.“So, that’s one of the few very exciting and readily available examples of where computer engineers are contributing their expertise,” he adds.Computer engineers, he explains, are in high demand.“They can work in any industry from manufacturing, electronics and computer systems to IT fields because they understand how hardware works. They have one foot in the electrical and electronics field where it’s primarily circuits, schematics, hardware, and the other foot in programming languages.Patrick elaborated that these engineers have the synthesis of two worlds, both of hardware and software, and that they understand the underlying electronics that happen along with it.“They understand the underlying firmware and how to connect hardware to software to make things run a little bit better.”Computer engineering, he continues, would be an attractive career proposition for students with an interest in programming, apps development, and those with an inclination to building circuits or IoT devices.UTP introduced its computer engineering in 2016 as there is a need for this field in the near future in developing countries like Malaysia.The priority is to ensure that the undergraduates are equipped with strong foundational skills that can be applied to emerging technological trends.“We take a different approach from other computer engineering programmes in that we approach it from the ground up,” Patrick mentions.“So, students learn from the very small to the large server-based systems. When we started the programme five years ago, our approach was to instill in them a maker culture so that they could build circuits and systems from scratch.“To do that, they need knowledge in basic computer systems, basic embedded systems or microcontroller systems, and we started to expose students to emerging trends such as big data analytics as well as data visualisation.“We are now in the midst of enhancing the curriculum to prepare for the next five years. With the next iteration of the programme, we are slowly changing the focus to incorporate artificial intelligence into embedded systems, and explore its connection to large and small systems,” he affirms.Basic skills and industry exposureStudents at UTP are also equipped with skills in various programming languages. These open-source programming languages include C, C++, Java, Python and R, which is the programming language for big data analytics.“We expose students to microcontrollers, like Raspberry Pi (good for software applications), Arduino (that make hardware projects simple), as well as the chips and architecture of ARM,” describes Patrick.“We do this because ARM is becoming a worldwide standard - many devices run on ARM, for example mobile devices like the iPhone. So, we give them that kind of exposure.”Undergraduates also benefit from the Computer Engineering programme’s collaborations with UTP’s Centre for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research (CISIR), which is focused on medical imaging and video surveillance among others.“So, we try to link the programme with some of the research undertaken at CISIR research.”Patrick relates that undergraduates also benefit from projects relevant to the needs of industry and community.Students hone their skills in systems integration through IoT-based projects such as for smart farming, for instance, he adds.“We want our students to also be able to handle an entire infrastructure, from the capturing of data to its transfer to a larger system,” he says, adding that one of the projects currently being undertaken is an improvement to the MySejahtera app.Students are integrating sensor information and sensor technology with the hand phone, and developing their own dashboards to display the data for tracking, so that close contacts of a Covid-19 positive case can be tracked and traced quickly.UTP’s seven-month Student Industrial Internship Programme, its state-of-the-art labs, a multinational campus, and internationally recognised academic staff also set the university apart from other institutions of higher learning.The university is ranked 70th in the QS Asia University Rankings 2021 and also has a high ratio of international community among its staff and students.This offers students a unique global intellectual and cultural experience.For more information on UTP’s computer engineering programme, visit www.utp.edu.my"

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,News,RENA LIM,UK doc impressed with virus handling,"GEORGE TOWN: Before Malaysians rant about how the country is dealing with Covid-19, try viewing it through the eyes of a Penang-born doctor who spent over a year battling the pandemic in London.Intensive care specialist Dr Nazri Unni (pic), 39, has been treating Covid-19 patients at Royal Free Hospital in London since March last year.Now back here for a three-week break, Dr Nazri is impressed with how Malaysia is handling the pandemic.“In the United Kingdom, they treat Covid-19 differently. There are no low risk centres or quarantine centres.“Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms are only told to quarantine at home,” he said, adding that doctors had to rely on such patients to be sensible and disciplined,” he said.Dr Nazri noted the strain low-risk Covid-19 centres were putting on frontliners in Malaysia.“It is extremely resource intensive and there is significant cost for the government to bear,” he said.Dr Nazri commended the move by the government to restrict travel.“Here, there are roadblocks at state borders and interstate as well as inter-district travel restrictions.“In the UK, there are only targeted checks and roadblocks on special seasons or holidays.“As for border controls, it only came in February this year and even then, there are no roadblocks. They were just guidelines and restriction advice,” he said.He said the willingness of Malaysians in general to comply with the movement control order was admirable.“Here, people seem more than willing to wear masks whereas in the UK there was a lot of resistance to wearing masks during the early pandemic period.“It took a lot of education and awareness before people in the UK started wearing them,” he said.Dr Nazri said Malaysia had a head-start in contact tracing system with the MySejahtera app.“MySejahtera is an extensive and well-developed application and I can see good compliance from the public in using the app.“In the UK, there was no electronic system initially.“There were only patient-doctor discussions to check where patients went and with whom they had contact with.“But later, when cases start to climb, they developed one because it was impossible to conduct discussions with every patient to trace contacts.“But due to concerns of privacy and intrusion of personal space, there is poor public compliance in using the app there.Dr Nazri pointed out, however, that there are measures the UK has taken which Malaysia might benefit from.“I think the most important thing Malaysia should now focus on is mass vaccination as lockdowns can only be temporary measures.“One of the things we can learn from the UK is the extremely fast rate of vaccinations.“They vaccinate some 400,000 people a day and now, over 27 million people are vaccinated, about 40% of the population,” the doctor said.Dr Nazri said that more resources in Malaysia can be used.“I remember one time in the UK, the situation was a lot worse than Malaysia is now,” he said.His ICU ward at Royal Free Hospital went from being a 34-bed ward to having over 90 beds.From September last year to March this year, he said the UK had some 25,000 patients in ICU.“But as the UK has much more extensive resources, they quickly reallocated a lot of manpower and resources,” he said.Dr Nazri said even soldiers were assigned to tasks such as helping nurses in the wards and to move and manage hospital resources.“Medical students were also assigned to help set up video calls for patients to talk to families.“These, I think, are swift and good moves that Malaysia can look into to help lighten the frontliners’ burdens and deal with the pandemic,” he said."
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,News,DIYANA PFORDTEN,‘Speed up jabs for factory workers’,"PETALING JAYA: Despite the national lockdown since June 1, the spread of Covid-19 at the workplace, mainly involving factory workers, continues to dominate cases linked to clusters.As such, health experts have called for a targeted vaccination exercise to stem the spread of the virus among these workers.Of the 162 new Covid-19 clusters identified from May 30 to June 5, a total of 51 clusters, or 31.5%, involved factory workers who were mostly detected from targeted workplace screening.These new clusters from factory workers made up 61.7% (1,825 cases) of overall Covid-19 cases detected from all new clusters.Universiti Putra Malaysia consultant clinical microbiologist Prof Dr Zamberi Sekawi believes that the spread of Covid-19 involving factory workers, especially foreigners, occurred at their hostels.“Even if some of the factories are closed during the lockdown, the workers live together and this is one of the factors contributing to the rapid spread of Covid-19 among them, ” he said.He said they were “vulnerable” due to their living conditions, and so vaccinating them should be a priority.“In some countries, migrant workers are not allowed to go out freely to help contain the spread of Covid-19. Here, they are allowed to do so and this fuels the spread of the disease within the community, ” he said.Dr Zamberi suggested that after vaccinating the high-risk group in phase two of the national vaccination programme, the government should look at available data and target the group which posed a greater threat, such as factory and foreign workers.He said should the government impose this measure, the ministries involved should be transparent on the decision-making process and consult experts and stakeholders in order to clarify why such measures were needed.Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman felt the lack of adherence to the SOP was a major contributor to the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace, especially involving familiar settings.“This is particularly true when individuals gather with their colleagues to have meals or to chat. Lack of adherence to the SOP is because most will trust each other, and they perceive it is very unlikely to get infected from their own friends or someone respected, ” she said, adding that most would adhere to the recommended preventive measures when they were with people they did not know.Due to the “prolonged” outbreak involving the spread of Covid-19 at factory sites, Dr Malina said there was no other choice than to expedite vaccination among the workers.“To rely on the SOP itself may be useful in the interim but for the long term, the results so far failed to provide the intended outcomes, ” she said.Association of Malaysian Medical Industries secretary-general Datuk Haminnuddin Abd Hamid disagreed that the spread of Covid-19 in the community originated mainly from factory workers.“I believe most of the workers got infected from the community or their families and brought it to the workplace or hostels and infected others, ” he said.Haminnuddin said the medical supply factory he owned followed the SOP strictly and adhered to the government’s directive to have only 60% of the workforce on site, although some of the production lines had to be shut.“Workers who do not feel well are required to stay home and sent for Covid-19 screening. If tested negative, they can return to work but those who have been a close contact will undergo the required quarantine and still receive their salaries, ” he said, urging the government to expedite vaccination for factory workers.Safetyware Group managing director Wong Kee Wei backed the requirement of allowing only 60% workers on site, saying this reduced the density in the workplace.“The current SOP set by the authority is good enough. However, the effectiveness depends on how strict it is being implemented and enforced by bosses, as well as compliance by workers, ” he said.Wong said people should be encouraged to voluntarily disclose their health status and close contact with those infected with Covid-19, as soon as they knew.“The company will then need to take quick action to contain any possible spread by getting the workers tested and workplace sanitised, ” he said, adding that early detection was key.He said the vaccination programme should be sped up and employers could help by encouraging more workers to register."

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,News,ALLISON LAI,Coping with the pandemic,"PETALING JAYA: Having to contend with the lockdown, a lack of farmhands and now the dry spell, vegetable and fruit farmers are turning to varieties which are easier to grow to stay afloat.Some have also resorted to reducing the size of their farms, with the enterprising ones offering their produce for sale on online platforms.Malaysia Federation of Vegetable Farmers Association president Lim Ser Kwee said with demand for vegetables and fruits having gone down over the past year, he had cut his vegetable varieties by about a third.Based in Simpang Renggam, Johor, Lim said he had cut down his vegetable varieties by 30% to reduce losses.“I used to grow different types of leafy greens like mustard green, spinach and lettuce.“Now I focus more on growing corn and pineapple, which are easier to grow and have a longer shelf life. These require fewer farmhands too, ” he added.Lim said from 50 foreign workers, he now depended on fewer than 20.“Farmers are having to compete with other sectors which offer foreign workers higher pay. This is a headache for us, ” he said.Lim said compared to last year, farmers were better prepared to face the uncertainties caused by the latest lockdown.“During MCO 1.0, many were still able to spend and willing to buy from farmers directly and pay for delivery.“But it is not the same this time, as consumers are cutting down on expenses after battling the pandemic for over a year. They’d rather buy in small quantities, ” he said.The federation is the umbrella body of 28 vegetable and fruit farmer associations nationwide with over 10,000 members in total.Due to weaker purchasing power among consumers, Lim said prices of local vegetables had been fluctuating.“To cut losses, some farmers have even shrunk their farms by up to half, besides cultivating fewer varieties, ” he said.Lim said farmers had also benefited with the experience of going through many changes in the SOP since the start of the pandemic.“We were caught off-guard last year when MCO 1.0 was announced and ended up heartbroken, with large quantities of produce ending up in the trash because we had no way of sending it to the markets and consumers. We certainly want to avoid this scenario, ” he said.To ensure the sustainability of essential supplies, Lim urged the government to consider the conditional entry of foreign workers.“There are many essential sectors in need of foreign workers and agriculture is one of them. In fact, we have a pool of regular workers who are interested to work.“The government can make it compulsory to test and quarantine them, and we employers are willing to foot the bill, ” he said.Meanwhile, Federation of Livestock Farmers’ Associations of Malaysia (FLFAM) president Tan Chee Hee said the supply of chicken and eggs remained sufficient for now.“Demand has dropped but the selling price is still stable. This is because we have learned from last year’s experience in managing and handling the pandemic, ” he said.However, Tan appealed to the government to allow the industry to be allowed to operate as usual, adding that the workforce cap and operating hours limitation would affect production soon.“Supporting industries such as feedmills, and slaughtering and processing plants are also important. We hope the government will allow us to operate at full strength to provide sufficient food supply, ” he said.He said livestock farmers were caught off-guard with the SOP requiring them to slash their workforce and limit operating hours, adding that such requirements were not in place during MCO 1.0.“We are in an essential industry which is labour intensive. If the government wants us to reduce our workforce, it will certainly affect production.“We are discussing with the government on this. We really hope the government will look into this issue, ” he added.Tan said limiting operating hours from 8am to 8pm was not feasible for the industry.“Between night and morning, we deliver processed and chilled chicken to the markets. Some companies distribute chicken and eggs across the country, ” he said.Tan also said at the poultry farms, physical distancing was maintained as a worker attending to one flock was far from the other worker."

This helped to speed up the registration process,” she said.The retired caregiver said the personnel and medical staff at the centre did an amazing job.“They were very professional and helpful in terms of keeping patients at ease.“The whole process, from registration to scheduling the second dose, took about 30 minutes.“I left the hospital before 9am, which was much earlier than my scheduled appointment time at 9am,” she said.Human resources consultant Normala Murat, 44, who received the AstraZeneca vaccine at the World Trade Centre, said the process went smoothly once inside the centre although it took slightly longer than expected.There was some delay outside due to the crowd and queue jumpers.“My advice is not to go too early in order to avoid crowding outside,” she said, adding that her vaccination process took about an hour.She also suggested that more attendants and signage be placed outside the centre.In Kota Kinabalu, retired teacher Martin Lee, 60, and his wife Anna Fu, 61, said they got their jabs two days ago at the Keningau community hall.“Everyone seemed happy and relaxed. There was no mad rush or anything like that,” said Lee.The nurses and medical officers were helpful and attended to people’s questions and concerns, he added.Similarly, 79-year-old Annie Chong, who came to the hall with her son Anthony, who is in his 50s, for the first dose of their jabs, said she was surprised at how well the vaccination programme was handled.“We reached there just before 9am and there was already a huge crowd. But there were seats for us as we waited for our turn,” said Chong.She said the process went smoothly, from the registration and briefing to the actual vaccination.There have been no reports of any major hiccups or problems faced at the various vaccination centres in Sabah.The minor issues involved brief blackouts, with the most recent one in Penampang on Saturday, when power had to be shut down from 4pm to 4.51pm due to repairs to a damaged power line.Sabah Electricity Sdn Bhd (SESB) had assured the public that it would constantly monitor supply to all the vaccination centres statewide.SESB chief executive officer Datuk Abdul Nasser Abdul Wahid said the utility company’s distribution control centre was using a flagging system on all feeders supplying power to these centres.“This means that when there is power disruption, an alert will be sounded immediately so that action can be taken,” he said.“The company is constantly working with state agencies and departments to ensure smooth power supply to all the vaccination centres statewide.”"

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",12:17 AM MYT,News,OMAR YOUNIS，MICHAEL HOLDEN,Meghan and Harry name baby daughter after Queen Elizabeth and Diana,"SANTA BARBARA, Calif./LONDON (Reuters) -Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, has given birth to her second child, a girl, whom she and husband Prince Harry have named after Queen Elizabeth and his late mother Princess Diana.Lilibet 'Lili' Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born on Friday at the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in California, with Harry in attendance. The couple's first child, Archie, was born in 2019.The choice of name pays tribute to the queen after a difficult year for the couple, and the wider royal family. Lilibet is a family nickname for the 95-year-old British monarch.Buckingham Palace said the queen, Harry's father Prince Charles and his brother and wife, Prince William and Kate, were delighted with the news. Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined them in sending his congratulations.William and Kate said via their official Twitter account: ""We are all delighted by the happy news of the arrival of baby Lili. Congratulations to Harry, Meghan and Archie.""Meghan and Harry announced the birth with a statement.""On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we've felt from across the globe,"" they said.""Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.""Harry and Meghan said Lilibet's middle name was chosen to honour her grandmother, Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997.Both mother and baby - who is eighth in line to the throne - were doing well and were back at home, their press secretary said.The nature of the announcement, almost two days after the birth, reflects the new life the couple have chosen in the United States.When William's wife Kate gave birth to her three children in recent years, she emerged each time alongside her husband from a London hospital just a few hours later to be photographed by the world's media that had camped out in the street.CRISISThe birth of Lilibet comes almost a year and a half after Harry and Meghan announced that they intended to step down from their royal roles, plunging the family into crisis.The situation deteriorated sharply in March this year when they gave an explosive interview to U.S. chat show host Oprah Winfrey, accusing one unnamed royal of making a racist remark and saying Meghan's pleas for help when she felt suicidal were ignored.The 39-year-old, whose mother is Black and father is white, said she had been naive before marrying into royalty.Harry, 36, and Meghan live in a secluded $14 million mansion in the celebrity enclave of Montecito, about 80 miles (130 km) north of Los Angeles, which is also home to Winfrey, comedian Ellen DeGeneres, and other celebrities.Harry's last major public appearance was at a VAX Live concert in Los Angeles on May 2. Meghan appeared by video at the concert, which aimed to boost vaccinations worldwide against the coronavirus.Meghan disclosed in a November 2020 essay that she suffered a miscarriage in July 2020.After the interview with Winfrey, Harry made further public criticism of his childhood, creating another public relations problem for the royal family which is led by the queen and 72-year-old Prince Charles.Just last month Harry spoke of the trauma of the loss of his mother and how that was compounded when he had to walk as a 12-year-old behind her coffin in a funeral cortege under the glare of the world's media.The queen, who lost her husband Prince Philip in April after 73 years of marriage, has said she was saddened to learn of the experiences of Harry and Meghan.The couple said they would be taking parental leave from their charity Archewell and have asked people who want to send gifts to support or learn about charities doing work for women and girls, the Archewell website said.The names given to the baby also echo those given to the only daughter of Prince William, Harry's elder brother, who is called Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.(Reporting by Omar Younis in Santa Barbara, Michael Holden and Andy Bruce in London, and Jill Serjeant in Los Angeles; Writing by Kate Holton and Andy Bruce;Editing by Alexander Smith, Raissa Kasolowsky, Frances Kerry and Sonya Hepinstall)"

Hema, 62, said the cafe was a place to celebrate special occasions in the early 1980s.“I was in my 20s at the time and not earning much money, so visits to the cafe were reserved for dates with my boyfriend, now my husband.“We would have lunch at the cafe before heading to the Coliseum Cinema next door, ” she recalled.Hema still has fond memories of the sizzling steaks and peach melba dessert that were must-haves during every trip there.“The service was slow but the food was worth it, ” she said.Veteran tourist guide Jane Rai expressed deep sadness over the cafe’s closure.Coliseum Cafe was one of the highlights of her heritage-walking tours of Kuala Lumpur.“There are so many untold stories revolving around the cafe’s origin, the history of those who have operated it and the heritage of the pre-war shophouse over the last century, ” she said.Rai hoped the owners of the building would preserve its heritage value.Jeremy Cheah, 43, said that growing up, visiting the Coliseum Cafe was a yearly affair for him and his family.“My parents and I would do our Christmas shopping along Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman and then have lunch at the cafe bogged down with our packages.“As a child, it was always a treat to see smartly dressed waiters, ” he said.The cafe was started by a group of friends from Hainan Island, China.It had weathered many significant milestones and stood tall throughout the British colonial rule, the Japanese occupation, Malaya’s independence, the formation of Malaysia and the millennium.It had also seen its fair share of famous diners, including Malaysia’s first prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, cartoonist Datuk Mohammad Nor Khalid or Lat, who hadleft behind caricatures of diners there, and British novelist and playwright W. Somerset Maugham, who visited the then Malaya twice in the 1920s.The cafe’s marketing manager Azrain Azman was quoted by a portal as saying they were unable to sustain the business since the movement control order was first implemented.He said the outlet relied on dine-in and regular customers and due to the MCO, they could not visit the cafe.The cafe, Azrain added, had planned to celebrate its centennial this year but this would no longer happen."

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,News,LIEW JIA XIAN,New future for old ferries,"GEORGE TOWN: Many companies have submitted proposals to turn Penang’s old ferries into floating restaurants and special tourist rides.Despite delays amid the movement control order, Penang Port Commission (PPC) chairman Datuk Tan Teik Cheng said that several suitable candidates have been identified.“Two ferries have been successfully picked up by eligible bidders. The other three ferries found suitable applicants.“All the iconic Penang ferries are expected to be handed over to the successful bidders by next month.There are six old Penang ferries. One was gifted to the state government, two will be turned into special tourist ferries, two will be transformed into floating restaurants and one will be made into a floating museum.“A contract of 10 plus five years or 15 years for each ferry will be signed, ” Tan said in a statement yesterday.On the damaged Pulau Pinang ferry, which had taken in water, Tan said the water was pumped out of the vessel when the river level receded at around 4pm yesterday.The hole will be repaired so that the ferry will float again.“Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong contacted me many times and showed his concern over this matter.“I hope that all parties understand that the ferry has been inoperable since Nov 27,2019, ” he said.Tan explained that the ferry was old and the engine could not be fixed anymore.“PPC decided to berth the ferry at Bagan Dalam river as the water is shallow, so the ferry cannot sink.“When the ferry operation was changed to speedboat service on Jan 1, PPC listed this ferry as a floating museum, ” he said.Meanwhile, commenting on the outburst last weekend after pictures of the Pulau Pinang ferry went public, former Jelutong MP Jeff Ooi pointed out that criticisms should be backed by fact-checking.“Politicians shouldn’t manipulate the ignorance of citizens who don’t have the facts and official records on how the fleet of old ferries were slowly retired and decommissioned in November, 2019, when Pakatan Harapan helmed the Federal Government.“We should stand up for facts, ” he said in a text yesterday.Ooi, in his Facebook post, said “old politics has no place in the digital traceability of today”.“Let the better factual argument win the day, ” he posted.Earlier, former Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng posted a comment that it was sad to see the state of the Pulau Pinang ferry after the service was stopped by the Perikatan Nasional government and Dr Wee.Dr Wee has since corrected Lim’s claim, pointing out that Pulau Pinang was towed to the Bagan Dalam dockyard along Sungai Perai on Nov 27,2019, during Pakatan’s stint in the Federal Government.“Spare parts from the Netherlands were not available and the ferry has been inoperable until today, ” Dr Wee stated.He noted that Lim was the Finance Minister then and Prasarana Berhad, the then ferry service operator, is a company of Minister of Finance Inc.He said at the end of 2019, Lim had announced an allocation of RM30mil to Penang Port Sdn Bhd for the purpose of purchasing new catamaran ferries and taking over the service from RapidFerry, owned by Prasarana."

ARAVINTHANFAMILIES in Singapore have to pay almost 30% more to hire a confinement nanny from Malaysia following the closure of international borders, Oriental Daily reported.The high demand for confinement nannies meant that the original market rate of between S$2,500 and S$2,800 (RM7,500 and RM8,400) monthly would now range from S$3,200 to S$3,500 (RM9,600 and RM10,500).Super Nanny Services director Alex Chua said the supply of confinement nannies in the island republic had dropped to between 20% and 30% compared with pre-Covid-19 times, as many of them are from Malaysia and could not cross the border.“Many customers are okay with the price increase. There is also a small number of families who no longer need a nanny as the parents switched to working from home,” he said.Chua also noted that the hiring process now was tedious and time-consuming, citing that the company had to pay for quarantine charges which may turn out to be a waste if the nanny candidate is not up to par.Another childcare and eldercare services company also said the monthly fee for a confinement nanny had gone up by 30%.“Some customers have no choice but to hire daycare or night care services that employ locals to help around the household,” she said.> Sin Chew Daily reported that stock prices of restaurant chains near the Ueno Zoo in Japan jumped nearly 30% following news that a female panda was showing signs of pregnancy.The zoo, which reopened on Friday after five months of closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic, announced that panda Shin Shin might be pregnant after mating with male Ri Ri in March.Since May 23, she is said to have been eating less and resting more, which are pregnancy signs she had back in 2017 before giving birth to a female panda cub named Xiang Xiang.Local media reported that such signs are sometimes a false alarm but many are still hopeful for a bundle of joy.The news gave a welcomebump to shares in eateries near the zoo.Shares of Chinese restaurant chain Totenko jumped 29% on Friday – the largest leap in four years, before closing at a 9.4% increase from Thursday.Another establishment in Ueno –French restaurant Seiyoken – also saw better trading prices.The above articles are compiled from the vernacular newspapers (Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese and Tamil dailies).

That, we will not agree with.“We want cooperation with the Opposition and even other parties because we see there is tension in Perikatan Nasional now, ” he said.Anwar claimed that Perikatan is currently in disarray, given the slew of issues that cropped up recently, including the spike in Covid-19 figures.“The captain and the ship are no longer in the same direction. It has sunk, ” he claimed.Recently, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s Parti Pejuang Tanah Air (Pejuang) had declared that it was not interested in cooperating with PKR due to its baggage in the past, adding that the party would instead seek an alliance with Parti Warisan Sabah and the Malaysian United Democratic Alliance (Muda) in GE15.Murmurs of possible cooperation between PKR and Umno have also been in the political rumour mill recently, given soured ties between Umno and Bersatu after Umno declared interest in leaving the Perikatan government.Speculation of cooperation was also rife when Pakatan and Umno had both issued press statements pressuring for Parliament to reconvene.Commenting further, Anwar said any form of cooperation must come with strict terms and conditions so that promises won’t be broken and the principles of good governance must not be compromised.“Leaders come and go but still, the problem remains where we are still entangled with issues on collecting wealth, stealing national treasures in the name of fighting corruption.“This cannot go on.

That is our way and method, ” he added during a special address to PKR aired on Facebook Live on Sunday (June 6).The public argument over which logo Pakatan should use in GE15 was triggered when PKR Youth chief Akmal Nasir on Saturday (June 5) proposed for PKR’s logo to be used in the next general election, just like in GE14 in 2018.This triggered a response from DAP and Amanah members - the latest from Anthony Loke - who said that this isn’t the time to talk about the GE15 logo, as leaders should focus on assisting the rakyat, who are affected by the pandemic.Loke claimed that the matter was discussed at length at a recent Pakatan retreat in Port Dickson last April.“Every party in Pakatan knows their respective stand and component parties have achieved a ‘general understanding’ in this matter. “When the time comes, then Pakatan’s presidential council will make a joint decision on this matter, ” he said in a Facebook post.Akmal’s proposal for Pakatan to use PKR’s logo in GE15 also triggered rebuke from Amanah Youth, with leaders from five Kuala Lumpur divisions (Lembah Pantai, Batu, Kepong, Bandar Tun Razak, and Bukit Bintang) issuing a joint statement on Saturday (June 5) rejecting such a proposal.“The consensus to use the Pakatan logo should give confidence to the public that Pakatan component parties are united and loyal in reaching the same ambitions to return the mandate to the people, and to bring Malaysia out from the ill effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, ” said the divisions.In 2018, the then-Pakatan Harapan coalition that also consisted of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu), had used the PKR logo as a sign of unity in taking on GE14."

Those under five can quarantine entirely at home if all preventive requirements against the spread of the coronavirus are met.Those aged 5-15, meanwhile, must stay at concentrated quarantine sites for seven days and can complete the rest of their quarantine at home if they test negative for the virus three times during the first seven 7 days.The number of Covid-19 cases confirmed in the latest wave of outbreaks since April 27 in Vietnaam has hit 5,561 as of Sunday noon, more than half of which were recorded in Bac Giang.Meanwhile, Vietnam recorded 206 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, including 201 locally transmitted and five imported, bringing the total tally to 8,747, according to the Ministry of Health.Among the community cases, 121 were detected in the northern epidemic hotspot Bac Giang province, 40 in the nearby Bac Ninh province, 31 in the southern Ho Chi Minh City, and five in the central Ha Tinh province.Most of them are contacts of previously confirmed cases or linked to the clusters of infections in the localities.Nationwide, as many as 3,368 Covid-19 patients have so far recovered from the coronavirus epidemic, up by 58 from Saturday, and over 183,900 people are being quarantined and monitored, the ministry said.As of Sunday, Vietnam has recorded a total of 7,191 domestically transmitted - Vietnam News/ANN"

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",10:26 PM MYT,Asean+,,Indonesia: Vaccination of ‘vulnerable groups’ begins amid expert skepticism,"JAKARTA, June 6 (Jakarta Post/ANN): Jakarta has begun the third phase of its Covid-19 vaccination drive, opening eligibility to “vulnerable groups”, which the administration defines as people living in areas at high risk of virus transmission.The city announced the new phase on Instagram on May 28, noting that vulnerable residents aged 18 and older would be eligible to receive the jab.The administration defines vulnerable residents as those who live in community units (RWs) that have high numbers of confirmed cases or those who live in neighborhood units (RTs) where new coronavirus variants have been discovered.The provincial health authority will determine which RWs and RTs are eligible under the programme.Health authorities will also prioritise people living in 445 densely populated RWs, as stipulated by Gubernatorial Regulation No. 90/2018.Jakarta Health Agency health surveillance and immunization head Ngabila Salama said more than 1.3 million residents had been listed as members of vulnerable groups and that around 142,000 such Jakartans had been inoculated from May 5 to 18.The health agency also said the vaccination of vulnerable groups would be performed alongside the vaccination of other prioritized groups, namely health workers, the elderly and public service workers.As of Friday, some 1.8 million priority residents of Jakarta had been fully vaccinated. Authorities hope to fully inoculate 3 million people in the capital in the early phases of the drive.Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan previously said the city administration aimed to vaccinate 10 million people living in the capital.Jakarta was the first region in the country to roll out the third phase of vaccination. National Covid-19 task force spokeswoman Siti Nadia Tarmizi said recently that the city’s vaccination drive would serve as a pilot project for programs in other regions.The ministry began third vaccination phases in other parts of the country on Tuesday, using a similar approach to the one used in Jakarta, where high-risk groups have been determined using geospatial, social and economic factors.The ministry has prioritised the vaccination of low-income residents living in densely populated areas, people with mental illnesses and disabled people.Beyond Jakarta, the government will conduct the brunt of its vaccination campaign in Medan, North Sumatra; Bandung, West Java; Yogyakarta; and Surabaya, East Java. Epidemiologist Dicky Budiman of the Griffith University in Australia said the “geospatial” approach used by Jakarta to prioritise vaccine recipients had “no scientific basis”.He said the city should take account of underlying health conditions in the determination of vulnerable groups.“When the vaccine supply is limited, the government needs to protect those who are most at risk in a population, ” Dicky said. “Most epidemiological studies suggest that people with comorbidities should get the vaccine, as they have higher chances of developing severe illnesses if they contract the virus.”While the geospatial vaccination strategy might add to vaccine coverage in Jakarta and other regions, he said, it might not effectively reduce the number of hospitalizations and deaths, which should be the main goal of the campaign.Dicky also noted that the low levels of testing and tracing in Indonesia had allowed most cases to go undetected. Therefore, he said, a particular area’s level of Covid-19 risk as determined by the local task force might not reflect the reality.The national Covid-19 task force recorded a 56 percent rise in daily new cases two weeks after the holiday. Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said on Wednesday that the surge was expected to reach its peak by the end of June.To counter the case surge, the government is seeking to administer 1 million vaccine doses per day this month, three times higher than the previous rate.“Our highest daily inoculation rate was 500,000 doses. But we aim to distribute 1 million doses per day this month and up to 1.3 million shots per day by December, ” Health Ministry acting disease control and prevention director general Maxi Rein Rondonuwu said on Tuesday, as quoted by tribunnews.com.The country’s vaccination program has been sluggish, with only 11 million of the 40.3 million prioritized recipients having been fully vaccinated as of Thursday.The government hopes to inoculate 181.5 million people, or 70 percent of the country’s population, by March of next year.But the vaccine supply in the country remains limited. So far, the country has received around 90 million doses of bulk and ready-to-use Covid-19 vaccines from Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech and AstraZeneca for the government’s vaccination drive.Meanwhile, Indonesia has also received around 1 million doses from China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) for the private vaccination drive, dubbed the Gotong Royong (mutual cooperation) vaccination program.Experts estimated that the country will need at least 426 million doses to be able to inoculate enough people to reach herd immunity. - Jakarta Post/ANN"

The more expensive ones can cover a three-room flat or larger.Charles Choi, 27, said he bought an air purifier on May 20 for S$169 at a discount. The engineer, who lives with his wife, said he did not regret the purchase.He said: ""Though my wife and I are still young, I do not want to take chances with the variant Covid-19 strains in the community.""We turn on the air-conditioner four to five times every month when the temperature in the evening gets too warm.

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",2:04 PM MYT,Asean+,,Malaysia-born funds guru: Investors must have eyes on China over next 10 years,"BEIJING, June 6 China Daily/ANN): Investment veteran Cheah Cheng Hye tells Luo Weiteng those who fail to jump on the Chinese mainland bandwagon over the next decade will miss the boat.Over the next 10 years, if there's only one market you've to get right, it must be the Chinese mainland.This is the saying that has been on everyone's lips across the global asset management industry today, said Hong Kong-based fund manager Cheah Cheng Hye.As China emerges from the economic chaos still present in much of the world, the country, riding high on its undertakings and goals of further opening-up, deregulation and reallocation of wealth, offers the biggest opportunity in at least half a century for those with the foresight in the world's asset management business to jump on the bandwagon, he said.Cheah, a Malaysia-born journalist-turned-fund manager, co-founded Value Partners in 1993 and built it into a successful, home-grown Hong Kong fund house - the first asset management company listed in the special administrative region and one of Asia's largest asset managers, with assets under management of $13.2 billion as of April and a focus on the mainland and Hong Kong.Despite mounting concerns over ""bubble economics"", with central-bank money printing distorting prices and pushing up markets, Cheah said he believes the mainland ""has been more careful and prudent, without too much debt to take excessive measures and managing to achieve a quite good degree of social and economic stability"".Chinese stocks now take on the sheen of a safe haven asset against volatility, he said, with the renminbi as one of the world's best-performing currencies. Cheah, dubbed Hong Kong's ""market goldfinger"", remains bullish on the nation's stock market, highlighting healthcare and domestic consumption sectors as particular areas of interest.""The value of Chinese stocks still has to be discovered by foreign investors,"" he said. Today, foreign ownership of the nation's stock market hovers at merely 5 percent, which pales in comparison to the usual level of 25 percent seen in other Asian countries, noted Cheah, adding that China will probably catch up over the next decade.There's also latent demand from domestic investors. The country's public ownership of stocks is less than 20 percent, which is dwarfed by the sheer size of the country's savings rate and a middle-class population of more than 400 million people - a figure projected to double by 2035. Besides parking the money in real estate and banking accounts, the Chinese public yearns for a healthy and well-developed stock market as an investment channel, said Cheah.Hong Kong's roleDespite the potentially huge opportunities up for grabs on the mainland, Hong Kong only recently returned to growth after a record-long 18-month recession. Cheah said Hong Kong is still struggling to ""find a way out from at least three to four generations of problems inherited from the past, including notoriously high housing prices and an education system that needs an overhaul"".With the SAR on the cusp of great change, what remains unchanged is its impeccable strength as a world-renowned financial center and its long-cherished role as a super-connector between the vast mainland market and the world.Cheah has high hopes for the upcoming Wealth Management Connect, which allows high-net-worth individuals across the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to invest in cross-border products.Value Partners is now geared up with several funds. At the age of 67, Cheah has much patience, emphasizing it's just the beginning. The Wealth Management Connect itself, slated to kick off early this month, may start on a small scale and time its takeoff just like the Stock Connect, which now contributes to as much as 15 percent of Hong Kong's stock market turnover.Cheah's career - a rags-to-riches story in the fund management industry - has seen him amply rewarded for his foresight and business acumen. One of his memorable successes was an investment in stocks of Shenzhen-based battery maker BYD Co 15 years ago, even before Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ponied up $230 million for a roughly 10 percent stake in the company. At that time, the then little known mainland company, founded in 1995 and listed in Hong Kong in 2002, had charted the course of manufacturing cars, inviting skepticism.During a visit to BYD's factory in Shenzhen, Cheah met with founder Wang Chuanfu, who showed him around the factory to help him figure out how BYD's car-making ambition could be taken seriously.The visit convinced Cheah that his bet on BYD, which later rose to become one of the world's largest electric-vehicle manufacturers in the span of a decade, would certainly pay off. It also made him take a good hard look at the reputation that China has earned for itself as the ""world's factory"". For certain types of products that require skilled and disciplined labor, he's a firm believer that the country, equipped with a constellation of young, skilled and passionate engineers, has a strong competitive advantage.The investment guru also learned from failures. One of his most unforgettable bets that went awry was on Oasis Hong Kong - a low-cost carrier that began operations in 2006 and positioned itself as a rival to Cathay Pacific by offering high-quality services at much lower prices. Within three months, Cheah saw almost half of his company's HK$30 million investment in the newly-formed airline evaporate. After 18 months, the airline folded, citing a lack of funding.Learning from mistakesThe experience made Cheah steer clear of any future investment in the airline industry, in which he's frank about his lack of expert knowledge. ""Now, I only stick to a few areas that I know best.""For buy-side investors like Cheah who every day make decisions involving billions of US dollars, learning the art of decision-making and from mistakes should be a life-long process and an ever-lasting theme in their careers. Over the past three decades, one-third of his decisions proved to wrong. Another one-third were correct and the remainder were""neutral"".""The key to survival is to identify the mistake early and correct it fast, rather than simply avoid any mistake,"" he said.""Unlike on the sell side, where people have to tell a compelling story to pitch their products and convince investors to buy them, on the buy side, however, what you're expected to do is to make the right decisions.""There's no shortage of people who avoid making decisions in real life as they cannot afford to make any mistake or take a risk in their careers. Cheah said the elements required of a good decision-maker include a strong character, great courage, solid research and true love for the profession. ""You make big decisions and hope for the best.""The real passion for the profession, in particular, stands out as one of the attributes that takes people further in their investment careers. Some may think of landing a plum job and making a big fortune in investment. But the long hours put in to learning from mistakes as well as the high standards required of their work will eventually make it nothing but an extravagant hope, he said.Without the interest and the passion, they can hardly expect to last the journey, said Cheah. - China Daily/ANN"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Business,DALJIT DHESI,FDI rolling in despite lockdown,"PETALING JAYA: The high number of Covid-19 cases, which resulted in a lockdown, will unlikely deter foreign direct investment (FDI) into Malaysia as they are long-term in nature.Although the lockdown may have affected investors’ sentiment, this is seen as a transitory hurdle, according to economists.Socio Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie (pic below) told StarBiz that although the lockdown is expected to dampen sentiment, FDI inflows into Malaysia are expected to improve this year and enjoy better prospects over the medium-term.He attributed this to the expected strong recovery in global economic growth led by the United States and China.Better global economic growth would induce outward investments from the advanced economies to Malaysia, he said.Furthermore, the rollout of Malaysia’s Digital Blueprint Programme is expected to boost FDIs in the development of software and hardware digital infrastructure as well as 5G.The eventual implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership or RCEP will also place Malaysia as a competitive nation and attract more foreign investments.A survey conducted by Standard Chartered in April showed Malaysia as the top choice for Chinese companies looking for expansion opportunities in Asean.However, Lee said pending the lifting of the emergency and reconvening of Parliament, Malaysia has to quickly roll out the 12th Malaysia Plan (2021-2025) and New Industrial Master Plan to chart its future direction.“Domestic and foreign investors are anxious to find out what the medium and long-term strategic measures and initiatives are to drive the country’s growth and investment path forward.“Post the Covid-19 landscape will be more competitive and complex in the business and cost dimension.“The emergence of new digital technologies, changing structures of international competitiveness, and growing domestic challenges such as structural ones could cause disruptions to the country’s economic potential.“Hence, the government has to address the weaknesses to enhance Malaysia’s attractiveness as a competitive investment location, ” Lee said.AmBank Group chief economist Anthony Dass Pic below) expected the FDI outlook for this year to be better than last year.However, much would depend on the global and domestic macro conditions – the prime catalysts – to determine the “actualisation” of investments over the next few years, he said.“For 2021, we are not ruling out potential delays in FDI inflows materialising as investors may prefer to take a wait-and-see attitude until the domestic situation stabilises. Nonetheless, the most of the FDI inflows are long-term in nature.“Hence, investors will be able to look past the temporary ‘setback’ and focus on domestic business policies, ” he said.Dass said total approved investments this year may improve with either a smaller contraction or turnaround with a small growth of 2% to 5% from the RM164bil in 2020.Total approved investments fell by 22.4% to RM164bil last year (RM211bil in 2019).He said it would depend on the management of the Covid-19 cases and stepping up of the vaccination programme to reach herd immunity by year-end.There is also a need to have policy clarity and consistency such as the standard operating procedure (SOP) during the restrictive movements, he said, adding that the country needs to establish a strong political institution. These are key factors that would influence confidence, capital expansion of businesses.Prior to the recent lockdown, he said Malaysia managed to attract FDI inflows worth RM81.9bil from 240 companies.“There are high quality investments in the technology, innovation, green technology, electric vehicles and financial technology sectors. About RM44bil worth of foreign investments are currently at various stages of evaluation, ” Dass said.He said the government should emulate South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.“These countries focused on quality over quantity. They engaged in sophisticated technology and were selective. While Malaysia looks strongly into investment evaluation prior to approving, we must try to ink technology transfer agreements with our foreign joint-venture partners and not merely accept whatever form of agreements in place, ” he said.RAM Rating Services Bhd senior economist Woon Khai Jhek Pic below) said given the improving global economy and investment sentiment, it is unlikely that the panic withdrawal of FDI as observed last year would repeat.The knee-jerk outflowwas triggered by heightened global uncertainties and limited operating environment foresight.With measures in place to tackle the rising Covid-19 cases and the ongoing vaccination rollout, he felt the current pandemic wave would likely be viewed as a transitory hurdle for the economy.Direct investments, he said, which are long-term in nature, would likely be determined by the fundamental strength and value proposition of the economy over a longer horizon.While the typical tax incentives and preferential treatments would continue to play a major role in attracting FDI inflows, the enabling of foreign investors to travel and conduct site visits under the current global pandemic is also mportant.A subdued investment appetite is unavoidable over the next few months given the operational disruption caused by the tighter movement control order.That said, FDI inflows should recover once the situation stabilises, consistent with the revival seen over the last two quarters.Net FDI inflows accelerated for the second successive quarter to RM9.1bil in the first quarter of the year.The Malaysian Investment Development Authority (Mida) took a step in the right direction by setting up a one stop centre to expedite the approval of the entry of business travellers as well as a business travellers centre in KLIA.On the potential sectors that could sustain foreign investments, Woon said the manufacturing and services sector has been the main recipient.Woon said the electrical and electronic (E&E) sector has the brightest prospect given the current global chip supply shortage as well as the ongoing tech upcycle.Malaysia is a major player in the global E&E supply chain, with E&E constituting close to 40% of Malaysia’s overall exports.OCBC Bank economist Wellian Wiranto (pic below) said there would be an inadvertent negative impact on Malaysia’s FDI attractiveness with the lockdown in place.Given the continued difficulties in cross-border travel, it would remain logistically challenging for senior decision-makers from prospective companies to come to Malaysia and conduct their on-the-ground due diligence before committing their FDI capital.Stringent protocols, despite the short-term pain, would be long-term answer to curbing the pandemic.“This will reverse some of the negative factors and allow FDI capital to flow back into Malaysia. Apart from continued measures by the government to attract FDI capital via preferential tax treatments, it is crucial to get the pandemic under control, ” said Wellian."
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Business,B.K. SIDHU,Managing loan repayments,"UNLESS you have super rich parents or have inherited lots of money, the likelihood of you taking some kind of loan, hire-purchase or mortgage facility to make important purchases is high.But repayments can be a nightmare during this Covid-19 pandemic especially for those who lost their jobs or had to take pay cuts.Indeed, many are struggling financially and have to make tough choices. Emotionally, it can be draining.Fortunately, the government has urged banks to be more lenient by offering a repayment holiday or moratorium.The latest targeted repayment assistance (TRA) allows the B40 group and those who lost their jobs to opt for a three-month loan moratorium, or reduce monthly installments by 50% for six months.This moratorium is not automatic. Several banking groups have come forward to assist their borrowers.“The enhancements to the TRA will enable affected customers to go through a simplified application process and obtain automatic approvals within a short period, ” said RHB Banking Group managing director/group CEO Datuk Khairussaleh Ramli.Creador Foundation senior programme manager Shobana Sivanendran says borrowers need to understand the impact of the moratorium on their loan terms as different banks might have different arrangements.In trying times, putting food on the table far outweighs loan repayments.But a loan is a loan. Sooner or later it needs to be paid.If you have fallen back on your loan repayments, try your best to catch up.Apart from interest and the compounding interest effect, other consequences can be severe and your creditworthiness can be compromised.Your creditworthiness determines your ability to take on new borrowings.“Every debt problem can be managed, even though it may not be easy. It requires you to make a plan and stick to it, ’’ said an expert.If your plan is to free yourself from debts sooner than the stipulated tenure of your loans, there are two distinct strategies to settle outstanding balances known as the “debt avalanche” and “debt snowball” methods, a report said.The methods apply to consumer, auto, personal loans, credit cards and others types of loans.To do that, you need to first list your debts. Rank them from highest interest charges – mostly credit cards and personal loans to lowest, and, largest to smallest debt.You need to make a minimum payment on all except one, the report said. You pay extra money to settle the debt with the highest interest rate, and this is known as the debt avalanche method.Shobana said paying off your loans with the highest interest rate will help you reduce the chances of having to pay more interest.In the current regime of low interest rates, try to re-negotiate to bring down the rates.For the debt snowball method, Shobana said you pay down your smallest debt first, then move to the next, regardless of the interest rate.“If your repayment on the first debt is RM100 per month, (with that settled), you repay your second debt, which is RM150 a month, try to pay off RM250 a month instead, ’’ she adds.With that, you are accelerating the repayment of your second debt.To pay off your debts you need to trim your expenses and be mindful of your spending patterns. Prioritise your essentials and don’t let your bills grow faster than you can pay them.Is it better to just take on a bigger loan to settle all outstanding debts?You can do that. But check the interest rates of the new loan, and if it is lower than your existing loans.“Be aware that a lower interest rate could make your monthly repayments more affordable. But it might mean prolonging your repayment period (because you are taking on a new loan), ’’ Shobana said.You have to make sure you can afford to repay it or again you may fall into the trap of having “being charged penalties for late or missed payments.’’If you do not settle your loans timely, your lenders can file for bankruptcy. Avoid this at all costs, it disrupts lives and affects your credit score. Instead, talk to the lenders and keep negotiating to reach the most affordable repayment terms.If you are unable to tackle your debts by yourself, do seek help from recognised agencies that can help you come up with a debt management plan.Make sure you go to a reputable organisation and not some unauthorised agent that claims to represent financial institutions.The Credit Counseling and Management Agency or AKPK offers free advice and guidance to borrowers including options for debt restructuring.There are other agencies, including Creador Foundation, which provides financial literacy education for low and middle income adults via Multiply.Whatever your financial situation may be, take time to review it and safeguard your creditworthiness. Your goal should be to set yourself free from debt rather sooner than later."
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Business,YAP LENG KUEN,Insight - Interest rate cut on the cards?,"ECONOMIC activities were picking up momentum, but all are hit by the recent surge in Covid-19 infections.The interest rates are already very low with the overnight policy rate (OPR) at 1.75%. Will there be another cut if the lockdown were to lower growth?Savers and retirees are feeling the pinch of current low levels of savings rates although the more sophisticated ones can turn to high-yielding bonds but some fall prey to investment scams offering higher returns.Reduced OPR will lower banks’ net income margin as there is a time lag for deposit rates to be adjusted lower, while financing rates are lowered almost instantly when the rate changes.“Financing growth could be slower but there are avenues for banks to mitigate the risks of a lower OPR, ’’ said Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd CEO Mohamed Muazzam Mohamed.Non-fund or fee-based income (in particular the trading books of sukuk where prices are inversely related to interest rates), could help to mitigate the reduction in fund-based income that is derived from interest earned on loans.The longer the lockdown drags on, the greater the likelihood of a rate cut although other tools may also be used to help stimulate the economy.Every two weeks of slowdown could shave off 0.7% from gross domestic product (GDP) growth, said Hong Leong Bank managing director, global markets, Hor Kwok Wai.“The longer it drags on, the more negative will be the impact, ’’ said Hor, adding that the OPR may be cut if the lockdown lasts beyond a month.A rate cut could occur when fiscal response from the government is not strong enough to offset the slowdown, due to issues on affordability.While phase one of the lockdown would last for two weeks, the reopening of even a few sectors could depend on whether the number of Covid-19 infections flattens.There is a possibility of an OPR cut in the near future if the country cannot flatten the curve for Covid-19 cases, said Alliance Bank Malaysia chief economist Manokaran Mottain. (pic below)Given the low base effect, a contraction is not likely for now, however, if the lockdown lasts for more than two months, it is possible that the OPR will be cut, according to Etiqa Insurance & Takaful Bhd chief market strategist Chris Eng.“Otherwise, they may run out of bullets and also incur diminishing returns from each OPR cut, ’’ said Eng.Leaving OPR unchanged at 1.75% last month, Bank Negara said there is more room for monetary policy to support the economy.Since the pandemic, it has cut OPR four times from 3.0% to 1.75%.Going by the baseline scenario of a two-week lockdown, OCBC Bank Malaysia sees the economy shrinking by 2.5% on a sequential basis in the second quarter, and 4% for the whole year.While some manufacturing sectors can stay open with 60% of their workforce, the exempted sector is the electronics and electrical sector which contributes around 40% of Malaysia’s total exports.Helping to limit the damage is the continued operations of the oil and gas and chemical sectors, as well as those producing personal protective equipment such as rubber gloves.Our baseline case is that Bank Negara will remain on a wait-and see mode and the fly in the ointment is the ongoing resurgence in virus cases and counter measures that would weigh on growth a lot more than expected, according to OCBC Bank Malaysia economist Wellian Wiranto.The room for fiscal policy in terms of government aid for the struggling groups and sectors may be limited, as the debt to GDP ratio is already at 58.5%, hitting near to the 60% statutory limit.“We see a rising possibility of Bank Negara cutting the OPR in its monetary policy committee meeting on July 8, ’’ said Wiranto.But Bank Negara is not likely to undertake massive rate cuts beyond 25 to 50 basis points adjustments at this stage.In looking to lower rates, the government will have to consider supply-side inflation (caused by rising prices of product inputs) trending up.“Bank Negara will be cautious to prevent it from spilling over into a demand-pull inflation (when consumers have more discretionary income to spend), ’’ said former RHB Research Institute chief Asean economist Peck Boon Soon.It also has to be careful to prevent a further build-up in financial imbalances.Cashflow problems have to be addressed, as prices of sugar, palm oil, cocoa, steel and other commodities have gone up.Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) cannot pass through the costs for those products under supply contracts, while those in the consumer goods sector have started to pass on the costs.“The loan moratorium is more meaningful as there is now a cashflow issue for survival, ’’ said Small and Medium Enterprises Association national secretary Yeoh Seng Hooi, adding that rental rebates and wage subsidies are also big ticket considerations.It is better to reserve the arsenal of rate cuts as the banks’ continued targeted repayment assistance with simplified documentation would help to ease borrowers’ cashflow burden, according to Socio Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie.Monetary policy, as in lowering of rates, may not be an adequate response although it helps the government to reduce its debt servicing charges at a time when GDP growth is muted and debt is surging.“The appropriate action plan is to vaccinate, vaccinate and vaccinate, ’’ said former Inter-Pacific Securities head of research Pong Teng Siew.With a sustainable flattening of the Covid-19 cases, it is hoped that a sharper-than-expected return in business and consumer confidence can help pull up GDP growth once again.Yap Leng Kuen is a former StarBiz editor.

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Business,DAVID TAN,Thong Guan aims big,"GEORGE TOWN: Thong Guan Industries plans to be an RM2bil group with a pre-tax profit of RM200mil by 2027.Group managing director Datuk Ang Poon Chuan (pic below) told StarBiz that the group would invest RM300mil over the next six years to achieve its goal.“Over the next six years, we expect to see the group achieving a 10% to 15% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR).“Our proposed Myanmar expansion project, courier bags, and packaging materials for the food and beverage, hygiene, food wrap, and stretch film sectors will spearhead the group’s growth over the next six years, ” he said.On the group’s 2021 performance, Ang is confident that the group’s revenue would surpass the RM1bil mark, up from RM961mil in 2020. The group’s production capacity will be increased to 175,000 tonnes this year from 150,000 tonnes in 2020 to cater to the surge in demand for plastic packaging products.However, Ang added that the no-dine-in restrictions imposed on food and beverage outlets and hotels had impacted the group’s food-wrap business.“Once the pandemic is over, we expect to see the food-wrap business grow again, ” Ang added.On its stretch film project in Myanmar, Ang said the stretch film project would start end of 2021. The main lure of Myanmar, he explained, is the country’s status as a developing country, which would allow it to enjoy zero-tariff privileges for its exports.“Importers don’t need to pay any duty for the goods they buy from Myanmar; whereas if the goods are produced in Malaysia, and they are heading to the United States, the importers over there would need to pay a 4.9% tariff.“European importers, on the other hand, would need to pay a 6.5% tariff for Malaysian-made plastic packaging products, ” Ang said.According to Ang, the demand for food and beverage (F&B) products worldwide has increased.“Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, more people are buying from supermarkets to eat at home. This has resulted in the rise in demand for stretch films used for wrapping food and beverage goods, hygiene products, and e-commerce mailer bags goods, ” he said.“In the domestic market, we also see an increase in the use of laminated packaging materials for wrapping F&B products, ” he added.Ang said he expected the premium markets in the US, Europe, and Australia to contribute about 20% of the group’s 2021 revenue.He noted Europe used to be a single-digit percentage contributor to the group’s income.Ang revealed the market in Japan also showed no signs of slowing down.“It will contribute about 20% to this year’s revenue, ” he added.According to Ang, the group is optimistic about building on its market position and capturing new growth areas both locally and internationally for all of its products lines.“The group has expansion plans that include the construction of three new factory buildings on a 16-acre site in Sungai Petani to produce high-quality stretch and blown film products, courier and speciality bags, ” he said.For the first quarter ended March 31 2021, Thong Guan posted an RM21.7mil net profit on the back of an RM282mil revenue compared to RM17.4mil and RM244mil achieved in the previous year corresponding period.A Reportlinker report has forecast that the global market stretch and shrink film market will reach US$20.8bil (RM85.86bil) by 2027 from US$14.5bil (RM59.86bil) in 2020, growing at a CAGR of 5.3% over the 2020 to 2027 period.The report says China is forecast to reach a projected market size of US$4.5bil (RM18.58bil) by 2027, charting an 8.6% CAGR over the 2020-2027 period.Japan and Canada are projected to grow at a 2.9% and 4.2% CAGR, respectively, over a similar time frame.Within Europe, Germany is forecast to grow at approximately 3.7% CAGR."
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Business,JACK WONG,Press Metal upbeat about global aluminium prices,"KUCHING: Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd is upbeat about global aluminium prices going forward on anticipated increasing demand for the commodity as world economic recovery gathers steam.Group chief executive officer Tan Sri Koon Poh Keong (pic) said as global economic recoveries are expected to continue, demand of aluminium will also pick up and, consequently, prices are expected to be kept at elevated levels.He said the global aluminium price had strengthened significantly over the last few months to current levels of some US$2,400 (RM9,907.20) per tonne, and that the completion of Press Metal’s new Phase 3 smelter under capacity expansion in Samalaju Industrial Park, Bintulu is timely.Aluminium price, according to Press Metal, started to recover in mid-2020 and was back to pre-Covid-19 levels by fourth quarter-2020 as global industrial production rallied from its contraction earlier in the year.The new smelter boosts the group’s smelting capacity by 42% to 1.08 million tonnes per year from existing 760,000 tonnes per year, further cementing Press Metal as the largest aluminium smelter in South-East Asia.“The new phase (smelter) has commenced production, and we anticipate operating at full capacity by the third quarter of 2021, ” Koon said in the company’s 2020 Annual Report. He said the group’s smelting operations had continued to operate at optimium capacity despite the movement restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The strong aluminium price drove Press Metal’s (pic above shows smelting plant) quarterly earnings to record high.In first quarter ended March 31,2021 (Q1FY21), group’s after-tax profit soared to about RM258.6mil from RM130.3 million in Q1FY20 as group revenue climbed to RM2.1bil from RM1.83bil in Q1FY20 or an increase of RM271.7mil or 14.8%.For the coming years, Koon said global aluminium supply will face challenges as decarbonisation policies and environmental awareness are limiting the potential of any new aluminium supply.`On the supply of key raw materials - aluminia and carbon anode - to the group smelting operations in Bintulu and Mukah plants, he said Press Metal will be able to source a significant amount of its requirements internally by end-2021.“We now own stakes in Australian and Indonesian alumina producers as well as an investment in Shandong’s carbon anode production. With this, reliance on third party suppliers will reduce considerably, providing raw materials security for Press Metal’s smelting operations.” he said.To recall, Press Metal has invested US$80.2mil (RM331.07mil) for a 25%-stake in PT Bintan Alumina Indonesia (PT BAI), which is constructing a alumina refinery.The investment will provide the group with long-term supply of alumina via the purchase of not less than 50% of alumina produced before completion of the manufacturing plant and up to 1.5 million tonnes upon project completion.PT BAI has commenced production of its Phase 1 refinery with one million tonne capacity per year, and Press Metal expects the first shipment of alumina from the plant next month. In early 2019, Press Metal acquired 50% equity interest in Japan Alumina Associates (Australia) Pty Ltd (JAA), which holds a 10% interest in Worsley Alumina Unincorporated Joint Venture, one of the world’s largest and lowest cost alumina producers.Through this investment, Press Metal is entitled to a supply of 230,000 tonnes of alumina per year.“With our investments in JAA and PT BAI, the group will be able to secure up to approximately 80% of alumina requirement based on the enlarged smelting capacity of 1,080,000 tonnes per year.“This will serve to enhance the stability of our group’s aluminium operations by reducing reliance on third party suppliers and shielding us against supply disruptions, ” Press Metal said in the management discussion and analysis in the annual report.Press Metal, via a tie-up with Sunstone Development Co Ltd, set up Shandong Sunstone & PMB Carbon Ltd Co to manufacture pre-baked carbon anode, a primary consumable for the group’s smelting operations.Sunstone’s annual capacity is 300,000 tonnes and is now in full capacity production.Press Metal is entitled to purchase up to 160,000 tonnes per year with an option to purchase an additional 60,000 tonnes out of the plant’s total annual production capacity. The investment allows Press Metal to secure about 40% of its enlarged requirement.Koon said Press Metal has also embarked towards meeting environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards through several initiatives and has recently committed to be “Carbon Neutral” by 2050 across all its business subsidiaries and operations."

We think this is our strength, ” he added.A bigger population count would mean higher import and export trade activities within a particular country which would help the freight service provider in its business.Hence, Chew told StarBiz that the group saw huge potential in key regional markets such as Vietnam, which has attracted a lot of foreign direct investments and Thailand, where the population is twice the size of that in Malaysia.The company currently derives about 25% of its total revenue and profit from overseas operations, Chew said.FMH recently announced its results for the third quarter of financial year ending June 30,2021 (FY21), which saw its net profit rising three-fold year-on-year to RM6.05mil and revenue growing to RM215.79mil from RM136.97mil in the corresponding quarter last year.Chew said FY21 was anticipated to be a year of recovery for FMH, noting that it is well-positioned to benefit from the expected growth in global trade volume.“In the last couple of years, we were impacted by some loss-making associate companies, but we have come out of this, as we have disposed of them. This has helped contribute to our robust performance for the nine months of FY21, ” Chew said.“We are optimistic that our strong performance will continue in the fourth quarter of FY21 and beyond, ” he added.In the first nine months of FY21, the company saw its net profit grow to RM18.45mil from RM10.93mil in the previous corresponding period, with earnings per share rising to 6.61 sen from 3.92 sen.Chew said the company aims to continue growing at a sustainable rate and also notes that the growth it had achieved so far would put it on a higher base.“We have not put specific growth targets but we would like to attain consistent growth over time.“We are considered part of an essential business as the supply chain needs to continue functioning and we are not adversely affected by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, ” explained Chew.FMH recently also signed a joint venture agreement with CN Investment Ltd to establish a joint-venture company, CN FM Logistics (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.Commenting on the partnership, Chew said FMH has been working with CN for a long time and the agreement marked a deeper collaboration between the twocompanies.“CN is a Hong Kong based company and they are our agent and vice versa. They would like to expand their operations in Malaysia and find that we would benefit with this partnership. Their main business is logistics for high-end fashion, ” he said.“For us, FMH also does fashion logistics under our air freight segment.“So this JV is a natural fit in a sense, since we already have the existing facilities. We look to grow this, both on logistics (distribution to the retailer) and e-commerce in the future, ” Chew added."

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Business,,Yellen sees inflation as transitory rather than permanent,"LONDON: Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said the recent rise in prices will subside and the US labour market, while improving, still has a ways to go before returning to pre-pandemic strength.“We’re seeing some inflation but I don’t believe it’s permanent, ” Yellen said at a press conference after the G-7 finance meeting in London.“We at least on a year-over-year basis will continue, I believe, through the rest of the year to see higher inflation rates – maybe around 3%.”Yellen cautioned, though, that officials are still watching price increases closely.“I don’t want to say this is mind absolutely made up and closed.“We’ll watch this very carefully, keep an eye on it and try to address issues that arise if it turns out to be necessary, ” she said.The debate around inflation has intensified in recent months, between those like Yellen who argue that current price increases are being driven by anomalies created by the pandemic – such as supply-chain bottlenecks and a surge in spending as economies reopen – and critics who say trillions in government aid could fuel a lasting spike in costs.The headline measure of consumer prices rose 4.2% in the 12 months through April, and the numbers for May are due to be published on Thursday.“I personally believe this represents transitory factors, ” Yellen said, adding that policy should look past such factors.Yellen spoke after the G-7 meeting, where policy makers reached a deal on a global minimum tax for some of the most profitable companies.“There is a concern among some about fiscal sustainability and an evident desire to begin to withdraw accommodation when things are back on track, ” Yellen said.“We think that most countries have fiscal space.”While the recovery is taking hold, there are still millions of people in the United States who lost jobs during the pandemic and have yet to return to the labour force, Yellen said.“We shouldn’t expect this process to be complete in a month or two, ” she said, but added that the United States could return to full employment by sometime next year.US job growth picked up in May – along with worker pay – and the unemployment rate fell to 5.8%, according to a Labour Department report. — Bloomberg"

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Business,,‘Grid of the future’ determines energy transition,"PETALING JAYA: Tenaga Nasional Bhd (TNB) will continue to give priority to investing in modernising the national grid into the “grid of the future”, a smart grid that remains dependable, resilient to disruption, smart with digital technology and flexible in meeting the nation’s energy transition needs.Therefore, under the Incentive Based Regulation (IBR) framework, TNB planned to invest RM9bil annually from 2021 to 2024, subject to government approval, to continue its efforts in developing the grid of the future to be a key enabler of energy transition by connecting the entire value chain from generation to delivery and distribution all the way to the customer’s premises.Consumers have actually enjoyed the grid of the future in the last few years through TNB’s capital expenditure, also under IBR, which included all the features used by global energy utility such as distribution automation (DA), geospatial information system (GIS), advanced metering infrastructure with a resilient grid system equipped with cybersecurityThese initiatives started with TNB transformation programme, Reimagining TNB (RT), since 2016 whereby preparations for the grid of the future is one of the four main pillars of the programme to achieve TNB’s target to become among the world’s top 10 utility company by 2025.Nevertheless, chief grid officer Datuk Husaini Husin said TNB needed to continue investing to ensure a more flexible and consistent grid to accept other sources especially RE such as solar which is expanding with more consumers becoming prosumer.Currently, the country’s electricity supply is already world-class and even better than some developed countries including in Europe.In the transmission system minutes that measure the minutes of interference due to high voltage each year, TNB recorded a reduction to 0.08 minutes in 2020, its 12th consecutive years below the two-minute level.It is a superior achievement in South-East Asia as well as in the world. For comparison, ESKOM South Africa recorded 3.16 minutes (2019), TransGrid Australia 0.25 minutes (2019) and FinGrid 0.15 minutes (2020).Strengthening the grid system alone is not enough, digital technology ingenuity is also used to complete the aspirations of the grid of the future and a comprehensive strategy called the Digital Transformation Grid Programme has been formulated, focusing on digital development on four basic thrusts namely assets, employees, systems and innovation.A total of 55 digital initiatives are actively undertaken under this programme and spearheaded by Control Tower, a new function created to ensure the digital grid transformation journey is implemented effectively while maximising the return on investment made in line with RT’s aspirations.The System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), the global energy industry’s method of measuring the average length of time consumers spend when a supply disruption occurs in a year, has consistently declined under 60 minutes since 2014 to reach 44.95 minutes last year.This achievement put TNB in a world-class position for SAIDI Country category after South Korea’s KEPCO (8.31 minutes) and Brunei’s DES (34 minutes) while SAIDI for developed countries such as Fance’s Enedis is 64.2 minutes and Italy’s Enel is 49 minutes.These are among the progress achieved through investment in the DA system installation to accelerate supply recovery which to date has involved 17,965 of the more than 85,000 distribution substations across Peninsular Malaysia. — Bernamaquipped with Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) that enabled self-healing grid capability, it is able to isolate network faults automatically and make recovery automated also by changing the supply flow.To maintain voltage stability, Volt-VAR Optimisation (VVO) is also implemented.These are five of the seven initiatives aggressively implemented by TNB throughout the peninsula and five more additional initiatives would be carried out to complete the smart utility programme in line with TNB transformation.All these efforts became more effective when customers participation is strengthened through the installation of smart meters, which have reached more than 1.2 million in Melaka and the Klang Valley, allowing customers to control their energy consumption through daily data monitoring on the myTNB web portal and application.“The results of this massive investment can be assessed by the benchmark Smart Grid Index (SGI) 2020 with TNB getting 62.5%, second in Asean behind SP Power from Singapore (75%). TNB’s aspiration is to reach 85% by 2025 to be among the top 20 utilities in the SGI World Ranking, ” Wan Nazmy said.Contributing to nation’s economic developmentSGI is a worldwide smart grid energy utility performance level measurement indicator based on seven key dimensions namely customer satisfaction and empowerment, security, green energy, monitoring and control, data analysis, supply reliability and renewable energy integration.He said the implementation of various programmes for the smart grid is able to contribute to the nation’s economic development besides winning customers heart with the best service at an affordable price.“The implementation of these programmes aims to stimulate the country’s economic growth, develop the green energy sector, accelerate the knowledge-based economy and create various employment opportunities.“It will also support the national agenda to move towards a low carbon economy as well as drive the aspirations of the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) by developing supplier capabilities and skills, ” he added. -- Bernama"

He called on Britain to honour its agreements.David Frost, Britain's minister in charge of EU ties, said EU negotiators needed to adopt a ""new playbook"" for talks.In comments published by the Financial Times, Frost said the EU needed to show more pragmatism and less ""legal purism"".""We continue to work for negotiated solutions which achieve this. But time is starting to run out. We need to see progress soon. I hope we can this week,"" Frost said.Britain had made huge compromises to make the agreement work, he added.Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said Frost continued to blame EU inflexibility for difficulties around the protocol.""This is simply not the case... Is this about media messaging in UK or really solving problems together?,"" he said on Twitter.Preserving the delicate peace without allowing the United Kingdom a back door into the EU's single market via the Irish border was one of the most difficult issues of nearly four years of talks on the terms of Britain's exit from the bloc.Some politicians fear the dispute could spill over into violent protest in Northern Ireland.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson unilaterally extended a grace period on certain checks to minimise supply disruption.

It produces more than 4 million barels of oil per day.Sechin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, told an online session of St Petersburg's economic forum that it was hard to predict when the global economy would recover from the COVID-19 pandemic due to ""lots of uncertainties"" and slow vaccination programmes in some regions.""Long-term stability of oil supply is at risk due to underinvestment,"" he said.One of the reasons for underinvestment is energy majors trying to raise shareholder income via share buybacks and dividend increases, he added.He expected some shortages to kick in from the second half of 2021.Sechin also warned that new government subsidies and tax breaks to companies for a speedy decarbonisation of the economy would put a higher burden on state budgets, making alternative energy expensive.Meanwhile, a court order to deepen carbon cuts for Shell was a new form of risk for oil majors, he said.A Dutch court last month ordered the Anglo-Dutch company to slash its global greenhouse gas emissions, which stood at around 1.6 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2019, by 45% by 2030.Sechin also cited an energy crisis in Texas last February as an example of over-reliance on alternative energy sources.- Reuters"

Although I love the clay, I was, like, if I could just win a match. That's kind of where I was kind of coming in.""FEARLESS RYBAKINAThe 39-year-old Williams never really found her range but she recovered from an early service break in the opening set.However, a fearless Rybakina, who hit 21 winners to the 15 of Williams throughout the contest, responded superbly to break again and pocket the opener in confident fashion.The calm-headed and clean-hitting Rybakina, seeded 21, broke the Williams serve at 3-3 in the second set but immediately dropped her own as she betrayed the first sign of nerves.It was Williams, contesting the round of 16 at a Slam for the 64th time, who faltered though. She looked hesitant and sluggish and dropped her serve to love in the next game.Rybakina, who was born in Moscow but represents Kazakhstan, then calmly served out for the biggest win of her career as Williams belted a backhand long after one hour 17 minutes.Her reaction was subdued, and she later explained her mindset going into the match.""I follow the plan which we have. If it works well, I'm winning, and if it's not, I'm just learning from the matches.

Yannick Carrasco was first to the rebound but sent his header against the bar too.Lukaku should have had a second goal three minutes from the end but Croatia goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic made a goal-line stop at point-blank range to keep out his powerful header.Carrasco and Nacer Chadli blazed good chances wide while Croatia’s best opportunity fell to substitute Josip Brekalo in stoppage time but he was denied by keeper Thibaut Courtois.""I did what I had to do for the team,"" said Lukaku after the match.""This result gives us a great feeling.

She posted 73 and 69 for the opening two rounds.It was Ainil’s second tournament after making her first competitive return on LET for nearly 18 months at the Ladies Italian Open last week and missed the cut."

AVINESHWARAN,Don’t fall for dirty tactics,"PETALING JAYA: Ignore Vietnam’s mind games.National coach Tan Cheng Hoe wants his players to focus inwardly rather than being disturbed by the rival camp’s psychological warfare ahead of their crucial Group G tie against Vietnam on June 11 at the Al-Maktoum Stadium in Dubai.It is learnt that Vietnam’s eccentric South Korean coach Park Hang-seo had declared that he would quit the team if the team fail to qualify for the next round. In fact, he went further and said he was glad that he did not have to face the Malaysian fans in Kuala Lumpur.Cheng Hoe said Hang-seo is known for his tactics of intimidating opponents.“This is his way. We have played against him a few times and he uses mind games to get to the opposing team. It’s best that we ignore him and focus on our game, ” said Cheng Hoe.On paper, Vietnam indeed look superior, as they have beaten Malaysia four times and drew once in the last five meetings. Cheng Hoe is unperturbed over the past results.“I don’t see it as an added pressure. It’s a challenge for me, as every coach wants to get a positive result, ” said Cheng Hoe.“We’ve never won against Vietnam, especially under Hang-seo. Vietnam defend well as a unit. We need to find a solution to counter.“It won’t be an easy game. We just need the confidence. Their pattern of play never changes, so we’ll prepare.”Cheng Hoe’s main task now is to boost the players confidence as they have been down after their demoralising 4-0 defeat against United Arab Emirates. Their naturalised players, especially strike Guilherme De Paula, have been under fire.“Many felt that we need to make drastic changes after the defeat but we still have four days to prepare. De Paula is disappointed and sad after the game but I believe, he is experienced enough to overcome this setback, ” added Cheng Hoe."

""There are a lot of emotions, I'm so happy.""I was very nervous but thank god I won that (fourth) set... I will rest for sure, I am so tired today.""Delbonis drew first blood in the opening set when he broke to go 3-1 up but three double faults and unforced errors allowed Fokina to win four straight games to lead 5-3.Fokina sealed the set with a forehand winner well out of the Argentine left-hander's reach and the Spaniard did not let up in the second set, earning a double break once again to go 4-1 up as Delbonis made a slew of errors with his backhand.Angled winners and passing shots became a running theme in Fokina's points while drop shots from behind the baseline and one sensational pick-up that whizzed around the net post drew loud cheers from the sparse crowd at Court Suzanne Lenglen.Fokina's hot streak saw him win five games in a row until Delbonis finally offered some resistance, denying him on three set points before he caved in on the fourth.The pair traded breaks in the third set as Delbonis fought back and the Argentine clinched the crucial break at 5-3 to win a third set in which Fokina seemed to fade and made 17 unforced errors.But the Spaniard bounced back in the fourth to convert a crucial break point at 3-3 and, despite seeing his vocal fans leave the arena in the fourth set due to the COVID-19 curfew, as well as an underarm serve backfiring, Fokina triumphed.(Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis and Ken Ferris)"

Yes, I just asked the boys and they are looking forward to it,” De Boer told reporters.Denzil Dumfries was brought down early to present Depay with the chance to open the scoring from the penalty spot. Depay was denied a second goal just five minutes later as keeper Giorgi Loria made a full-stretch, scrambling save on the goalline.But after that Georgia threatened on several occasions in the first half with Saba Lobzhanidze having the best opportunity to get his side back in the game.The Netherlands wrestled back control in the second half with Weghorst finishing at full sprint after being played in on goal by Depay.After a strong season in the Bundesliga, Vfl Wolfsburg forward Weghorst made a case for inclusion in the starting attack when the Dutch open their Group C campaign against Ukraine in Amsterdam on Sunday.The third goal came after Depay had another shot saved by Sania but the ball rebounded into the air and Gravenberch finished it off.With six minutes left, Georgia substitute Jaba Jighauri struck the woodwork with a powerful shot as he almost beat the 38-year-old Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg.(Writing by Mark Gleeson in Cape Town; Editing by Toby Davis and Ken Ferris)"

They ended the tournament in Russia in third place.“It was one of the targets after the World Cup to grow, put together a deeper squad and allow ourselves to get more players in each position with a real competitive edge, ” said Martinez.He feels he has done so and the team are now better, but Martinez has warned that winning the Euros is far from certain.“It’s a bit of a bizarre tournament because we as the top seeds in our group have no protection. It has never happened in the history of the Euros, or the World Cup for that matter, that we play against two home teams. Most strange.”Belgium begin their campaign in St Petersburg against Russia on June 12, travel to Copenhagen to face Denmark on June 17 and return to the Russian city for their final group game against Finland on June 21.Axel Witsel has been included in the 26-man squad in a gamble on his fitness after Achilles surgery and Hazard needs to recover his form after an injury-ridden season at Real Madrid. — Reuters"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Sport,,"Can you beat that, Ron?","TWO exceptional men lay claim to being the king of the European Championships.France’s Michel Platini and Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo are tied on nine goals as the competition’s all-time top scorer.While CR7 will most likely break that tie as he leads Portugal to another Euros adventure this month, Platini fans can make a good case that the 1984 winner is an untouchable icon.Their argument is sound. While Ronaldo took four tournaments (2004,2008,2012,2016) to reach his tally of nine, Platini poached it all in one single competition in 1984.Inspiring France to the title in Paris, the captain’s nine strikes were accomplished in just five matches as the tourney only featured eight nations, in two groups of four.It’s a tour-de-force that is most unlikely to be bettered. Furthermore, Platini was a midfielder who outscored all the top strikers in the competition like Denmark’s Preben Elkjaer, Spain’s Carlos Santillana, and West Germany’s Rudi Voeller and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.It’s also easy to forget that his nine-goal feat included two back-to-back perfect hattricks (right foot, left foot, header) in group games against Belgium (5-0) and Yugoslavia (3-2).Platini’s 100% scoring record started with Les Bleus’ solitary goal in opening win over Denmark.His most heart-stopping strike came in the classic semi-final against Portugal.With the match deadlocked at 2-2, with just a minute of extra time left and penalties looming, Platini proved the talisman again, blasting home the winner at close range.In the final against Spain, the goal-hungry playmaker got a little help from goalkeeper Luis Arconada, who made a mess of his low free-kick and allowed France to take the lead in the 57th minute.Bruno Bellone doubled France’s lead in the last minute to give them an emotional 2–0 victory. Amazingly, Bellone’s goal was the only one of France’s 14 goals to be scored by a striker!But nobody cared, as it was Platini’s crowning moment – as Paris lit up like never before to honour its idol.Fast forward to the present, and it’s hard to reconcile the Platini of today – a disgraced, overweight 65-year-old former UEFA president and FIFA presidential candidate – to the maestro who could do no wrong as a player.Platini, along with ex-FIFA president Sepp Blatter, were found guilty of ethics violations and barred from the game until 2023.It’s sad to note that Platini won’t be a part of this year’s delayed Euro 2020 in any capacity – the plan to host it over 11 cities to celebrate its 60th birthday was his brainchild.But while he stands on the sidelines as a tainted administrator, Platini’s legacy as one of the game’s true greats remains untarnished.So good was the midfield general, that Pele once said he was the only French player who would be picked for any Brazilian team of any era.So, for the multitude of CR7 fans who proudly claim their idol is Europe’s finest ever, they should know that there was another hero who conquered the Euros first – and who actually conquered it best."

Today it was working good for me, I felt like my tactics were working even if I missed some of my drop shots.""Tsitsipas moved 4-0 ahead in a near-perfect start with Carreno Busta looking unable to find his range.The second set went through in the blink of an eye but Carreno Busta, who reached the last eight at Roland Garros last year, mixed up his game to move 4-1 up in the third as Tsitsipas failed to convert his breaking opportunities.The Greek, however, just had to move up a gear to turn it around, and he wrapped up the win with a crosscourt forehand winner.(Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Clare Fallon)"

It all depends on what the topic of the day is.“Usually, I pick up on what listeners want to share and get other people’s reactions and suggestions.“I do sympathise and empathise with people during this time, and my show is a place where we rationalise what is happening at the moment, ” he said.Night Chat, according to him, is for people to tune in as they wind down for the day, mostly talking about things happening within their community.One listener, for example, was upset that she could not hold her wedding reception due to the movement control order.Wang usually engages with other listeners to get their opinions on how to deal with a particular situation.“The listener’s fiance decided it would not be wise to hold the reception and dream wedding at this time, suggesting instead that they just register the marriage, do a memorable video and put the money into something else.“She loved the idea in the end.“I love that I can help people put things in perspective. This is the support that people need right now, ” he said.Wang feels being a radio DJ is his true calling as he has always been talkative, even as a child.“I love radio because I get to see people’s stories from different angles and evaluate their issues intellectually.“I get to understand different mindsets and offer opinions on what stand they can take.“I am lucky to have this job, ” he said.Midnight musingsFor the nocturnal ones, there is an alternative platform that people can go to seek interesting live conversations in the form of an audio-based social networking app called Clubhouse.Husband-and-wife team Naweshad Shariff and Shamin Shaimah, both in their 30s, host a show called Midnight Malaysia from midnight to 2am daily.While the virtual rooms on the app range from politics, the government and Covid-19 to more casual conversations, Naweshad and Shamin touch on topics that unite Malaysians.Their whimsical programme offers support to those impacted or struggling to cope.“We include topics like culture, heritage, history, arts, architecture, music, literature and cuisines, to name a few.“There are also creative discussion methods, such as storytelling, singing, games, knowledge-sharing and personal experiences, ” said Naweshad.But the most important mission of their show is that it is moderated in an open and friendly space that is respectful to all races, nationalities, religions and genders.Their daily topics might be fun to talk on but they have been given much forethought, Naweshad said.“We have a positive role to play during the show and if we make a false turn or give wrong advice, that could be detrimental to listeners, so we take it seriously, ” he added."
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Metro,IMRAN HILMY，R. SEKARAN,Meeting needs beyond fencing,"THERE are about 10,000 residents from approximately 2,500 households who are affected by the enhanced movement control order (MCO) in Bayan Lepas, Penang, said its assemblyman Azrul Mahathir Aziz.He said the residents lived in the 13 localities in the constituency, which have been placed under the enhanced MCO since Friday.“So far, we are doing our best to help all those who are affected in these localities.“We have our own Village Community Management Council (MPKK) members who would be there to assist the Health Ministry and Civil Defence Force personnel, ” he said when met at his operation centre at Surau Kampung Bukit in Bayan Lepas on Saturday.Earlier, Azrul and his service centre members helped to coordinate the distribution of 500 packs of fresh chicken and other essential items to the residents.He said the fresh chickens were contributed by Balik Pulau MP Muhammad Bakhtiar Wan Chik as part of the effort to ease the burden of the residents who were affected.“The distribution of the items will be coordinated by the MPKK team members who stay in the affected localities.”Azrul urged the residents to be patient and to cooperate with the authorities during this period.“When receiving the food aid, please be patient.“If you feel that there are more deserving families who really need the aid, maybe you can let them have it first, ” he said.Azrul said he was confident that the food distribution would be handled smoothly but urged those who were left out to contact him directly or the district office.Resident Mohd Hafizan Abdul Wahid, 33, who lived at the Sri Bayu Apartment, said he and his family have been following the advice of the authorities by staying at home.“There is nothing much that we can do.“For the time being, we will stay at home and if we need supplies, I will go out.“So far, the food aid distribution was conducted in an orderly manner and almost all affected residents received the aid, ” he said.The enhanced MCO is being implemented in Sri Bayu, Bayu Tiara, Bayu Nyaman, Halaman Murni, Bayan Permai, Bayan Tiara, Taman Ara Indah, Kampung Bukit, Kampung Perlis, Kampung Masjid, Jalan Mahkamah, Kampung Pak Lah and Lebuh Kampung Bukit.The decision for the enhanced MCO in the localities was taken after health authorities recorded 83 new cases within two weeks with a total number of positive cases exceeding 250.The enhanced MCO remains in effect until June 17.Meanwhile, lorry driver Sasikumar Selvaraju, 45, said he had been jobless due to the movement restriction under enhanced CMO.“I work in a company which does renovation and now I am unable to travel.“I don’t know whether I can sustain the month of June as I am now out of job, ” said Sasikumar, who is the sole breadwinner in the house, earning RM1,500 a month.He lives in the Bayu Nyaman Apartment, Bayan Lepas, with his wife, who is a housewife and a diabetic.“I am worried my employer will cut my salary when I am back to work.“We could not get aid from the state Welfare Department as we were told that we were not eligible as we don’t have children, ” he said.His wife S. Thilagavathy, 44, said the residents were living in fear as some living in the Sri Bayu apartments, who were wearing pink wrist bands, especially children, could be seen outside the apartment.“Both of us stay home as it is definitely a risk being outside.Nurse Wan Khairulnisah Wan Hassan, 30, said the residents of Sri Bayu Apartments were quarantined as the apartment has the highest number of cases.“We dare not venture out, and keep ourselves locked inside all the time, ” she said.Technician Sukri Kamis, 42, who stays at the Bayu Tiara Apartment, is worried over food supplies.“I have stocked up, but the mini market here has run out of supplies and I am fearful if there will be enough food for the coming week.“It is not safe to go out. Although I am feeling restless, I am staying put just to be on the safe side.Architect Aananthen Ramanaidu, 55, is feeling the pressure of missing the deadline for his project submission in Kuala Lumpur.“My office is at Bukit Dumbar in Jelutong and while I am used to working from home, certain planning with clients on designs could only be done from the office, ” said Aananthen, who lives in Taman Kenyalang running parallel to Jalan Mahkamah, which is barricaded by barbed wires.“I am trying to get a Health Ministry letter to travel and it is going to be an arduous task with the present situation, ” he said.Meanwhile, Balik Pulau OCPD Supt A. Anbalagan said since the enhanced MCO was imposed in 13 localities in the area, no standard operating procedure (SOP) has been violated so far.“So far, the situation is under control. There is no breach or violation whatsoever, ” he said.Supt Anbalagan, however, advised residents to heed the regulations imposed by authorities and to follow all SOP that has been imposed on them.“Police will continue to monitor and enforce the SOP in the localities. We hope that the residents will continue to abide by the regulations.“A total of 60 police officers and personnel are on duty at all 13 localities during this period and they will be assisted by personnel from the army, Civil Defence Force and state Health Department.“Residents can contact the district police or district operation centre for disaster should they have any problems during this period.”"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Metro,IVAN LOH,"Speed up vaccination, urge NGOs","SEVERAL non-governmental organisations in Perak are calling for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme to be expedited as the progress is currently too slow.Ipoh City Watch president Prof Dr Richard Ng said health authorities should go down to targeted locations like rural areas or villages, and use community halls to register people for the vaccine and also administer it.“They must understand that many senior citizens are not IT savvy and some are not staying with their children.“There are also those residing at nursing homes. The same goes for people with disabilities.“Thus, more inoculation centres should be set up in all districts for the convenience of the people.“Get volunteers, especially Chinese and Tamil-speaking ones, to help facilitate and call up registered recipients for their injections, ” he said when contacted.Ng feels the current vaccination process needs improvement.“The issues encountered so far include an insufficient number of people to administer the vaccine, and the lack of vaccination centres.“There’s also not enough monitoring in terms of implementation, resulting in many who have registered not being called for vaccination.“Some who were due to be vaccinated did not turn up as they were unaware of their appointment or did not have the MySejahtera app so they could not check the status, especially senior citizens.“The system needs to be improved through a reminder to all recipients, ” he said, adding that those who failed to turn up should be given a stern warning and a fine.Perak health executive council member Mohd Akmal Kamaruddin had reportedly said on May 29 that some 238,000 people under the second phase of the national immunisation programme in the state had received their first dose.Perak has a population of about 2.6 million people.It was also reported that several private hospitals and clinics have been roped in to expedite the vaccination exercise.Family Wellness Club president P. Mangaleswary said it was important that the government look into the reasons why people did not turn up for their jabs.“We are racing against time to get as many people as possible vaccinated.“The government could recruit qualified personnel, including retired nurses or healthcare workers from the private sector, to help out with the vaccination exercise, ” she added.Bank officer Michael Chang, 40, said it was good that people would not be allowed to choose their vaccine as this could hamper the process.“Let’s just focus on achieving the 80% vaccination rate for herd immunity, ” he stressed.Chang also said private hospitals should be allowed to buy and dispense vaccines at their premises.“If this is allowed, people can choose the vaccine they want and pay for it. This will improve the overall vaccination rate in the country, ” he added."

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Metro,IMRAN HILMY,More dorms for workers,"PENANG will expedite the construction of foreign workers’ dormitories to ensure they are sited in proper living conditions.State local government committee chairman Jagdeep Singh Deo said currently, two dormitory schemes for foreign workers in Batu Maung and Bukit Minyak were completed and could accommodate more than 6,000 occupants.“In the last few days, a few new clusters of Covid-19 emerged and nearly three quarters of them are from Bayan Lepas.“There is a need for us to expedite our efforts to place foreign workers in suitable places, ” he said during a press conference outside Church of the Immaculate Conception in Pulau Tikus yesterday.Jagdeep said the state government had sped up efforts to ensure foreign workers are placed in proper dwellings as a measure to prevent Covid-19 outbreaks.He said apart from the two completed foreign workers’dormitories, there are seven more dormitory schemes that would have 61,918 beds that are now under construction while another two schemes that could provide 10,700 beds is being applied for by developers.He said all these 11 dormitories could cater to a total of 78,839 occupants when they are operational.He, however, said these 11 dormitories are still not enough because the state has almost 200,000 foreign workers.“Among the other methods that we are working on to solve this issue is to allow the conversion of commercial spaces that are not being used into dormitories and to consider several applications from factories with big land space to build temporary dormitories for their workers, ” he said.He said so far, the state government had received two applications on the island and 13 applications on the mainland to build dormitories using these two methods.Earlier, Jagdeep distributed some 100 packs of food items to Penang Eurasian Association chairman Datuk Aloysius Gasper, to be given to the needy community in Pulau Tikus.He also distributed face masks to the public and enforcers in the area.Jagdeep was accompanied by Pulau Tikus assemblyman Chris Lee to check on SOP compliance at the church during the lockdown.On a mass screening programme at all 40 state constituencies in Penang, Jagdeep said the details of the programme are being finalised by the state government.He said the programme had been approved and RM3mil had been set aside to conduct the mass screening exercise.“Now, we are working to finalise it and we are identifying places to do the programme, ” he said, adding that the mass screening exercise is expected to finish in a month.Last month, the state government decided to carry out the first phase of mass testing for some 40,000 people in the state in a move to break the chain of infection.This would involve the testing of 1,000 people in each of the 40 state constituencies.The testing of some 400,000 factory workers in Penang using the deep throat saliva method also began early this month."

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Para athlete teaches dribbling and diversity to Italian kids,"Four second-grade classes in the Milan suburb of Verano Brianza have been learning to play basketball this spring from a real pro. They also got a lesson in diversity.Their coach for the month of May has been Adolfo Damian Berdun, an Argentinian-Italian wheelchair basketball champion. Berdun, 39, lost his left leg in a traffic accident at age 13 in his native Buenos Aires, and has visited many schools over the years to discuss how he has lived with his disability.But this time, when he entered the suburban elementary school, Berdun wanted to be simply “coach”.It was his first time in the role. He declined suggestions of a video introduction, and wheeled himself onto court the first day with a blank slate, no backstory.“Every class that came in looked at me with open mouths like they wanted to ask a question, ” Berdun said. “I said, ‘We can ask questions later, now we play basketball’.”The head of the sporting association that organised the five-week programme recalled the first day. Berdun made a simple introduction, then asked: “’Do you want to run?’ They said yes, and he said, ‘Run', ” said Elena Sandre. And off they went, starved for action after an academic year mostly bereft of team sports.Over the five weeks, the children learned to dribble and shoot; passing was limited due to Covid protocols. They lined up for drills, and navigated a slalom course on the gym floor.Berdun lowered two rings on either side of the basket, so kids who couldn’t throw to the 10-foot (three-metre) height of the standard hoop could have a shot.Sandre got to know Berdun as a journalist covering wheelchair basketball in Italy, first when he was in Rome, then Sardinia and finally when he arrived in the Monza province of Lombardy, where he plays on UnipolSai Briantea84 Cantù. The team won the Italian championship this year, and Berdun was named MVP (Most Valuable Player) for the championship. He continues to play on the Argentinian national team, but won’t be going to the Paralympics in Tokyo because his team failed to qualify.Sandre said she tapped Berdun not because of his disability, but because she had observed the way he commanded whatever team he played on.“If you see him play, you see he is a coach. He manages the team. He is a leader, ” she said. He had no trouble handling a sometimes noisy group of seven-year-olds.“I did not imagine that in a wheelchair, with so many children, I could feel so good, ” Berdun said.Even though Berdun held off on discussing his disability until the last day, the lesson of diversity trickled down. Sandre says she sees parents in social media posts talk about how “privileged” their children are to have the experience of learning from a para athlete.For his last day, the children gave Berdun drawings they had made.“But the most beautiful thing is that we succeeded in breaking down the barrier between the coach with one leg in a wheelchair, and the ideal of a coach, period, ″ Berdun said.”How do I know this? Because after asking me a couple of questions, they asked if they could continue doing basketball drills. That means they were more interested in playing than in knowing why I only have one leg.” – AP"

These sessions will empower destinations to switch to the digital platform, with the training adapted to reflect their specific circumstances and the unique challenges every destination currently faces.UNWTO secretary-general Zurab Pololikashvili said the partnership will focus on innovation and digitalisation to drive tourism recovery.“By working together, UNWTO and Google will empower destinations, businesses and tourism workers to realise the power of data and market intelligence, both increasingly important as global tourism looks to restart and recover, ” he said in a statement.Google managing director (travel partnerships) Gianni Marostica said the technology company is committed to “support the global tourism sector on its path toward broader economic recovery”.“It’s critical that both policymakers and businesses have the tools and insights they need to reconnect with travellers in a digital environment, ” he said.The collaboration will complement existing joint initiatives, and a data sharing agreement for Google’s Travel Insights to power a portion of the UNWTO’s tourism recovery tracker.The Tourism Accelerator Programme, designed by Google in partnership with UNWTO, will also be scaled up globally. A pilot programme was launched last year across Europe, Middle East and Africa.Moving forward, UNWTO and Google will collaborate on joint research projects related to tourism. The results will provide governments, destinations and businesses with data and insights for tourism recovery.Diversity for recoveryThe UNWTO also aims to empower indigenous communities to drive tourism recovery.“The cultural diversity and knowledge of indigenous peoples can bring innovative experiences and new business opportunities for tourism destinations and local communities, and help them recover from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, ” it said.The organisation recently partnered with the World Indigenous Tourism Alliance (WINTA) on a set of guidelines, designed to ensure travel experiences are respectful and led by the indigenous communities themselves.“These recommendations draw on the partners’ expertise and set out solutions for the socio-economic empowerment of indigenous peoples through tourism, ” UNWTO said.Some of these proposed measures include transitioning from “assisting” to “enabling” indigenous entrepreneurship, strengthening skills and building capacities, fostering digital literacy for running tourism businesses, and acknowledging the relevance of indigenous community."

If we win: South Korea.""Last month, scores of police and soldiers surrounded the home he shared with his wife and family in the central city of Shwebo.They accused the poet - who baked cakes and made ice cream to support his family - of planning a series of bomb blasts, and demanded he give himself up.The next day his wife Chaw Su was summoned to a hospital in Monywa around 80km (50 miles) away.""I thought I would able to (bring) him some clothes,"" she said.But there was no need, according to a police officer, who told Chaw Su her husband was dead.""I got only the dead body back,"" she added.Myanmar has been in uproar since the February coup ended a 10-year experiment with democracy that had loosened the fetters of censorship and allowed for greater self-expression.As some protesters picked up hunting rifles and slingshots, poets like Khet Thi joined a fight against the coup staged by a population unwilling to surrender hard-won democratic freedoms.Along with violence in the streets, the junta has tried to stifle dissent with Internet blackouts and by rounding up celebrities and civil servants who have called for rebellion.A video uploaded to Facebook soon in the weeks after the putsch showed a collage of defiant protesters reciting poems against the military.""With what conscience can you go to work while everyone goes out and protests?"" asked one man, referring to a mass strike campaign launched to pressure the junta.'Overwhelmed with rage'Poetry played a prominent role in Burma's struggle for independence against colonial power Britain and the decades of military rule that followed, when scores of writers were locked up as political prisoners.Britain-based poet Ko Ko Thett believes the medium has struck a chord with ordinary people ""overwhelmed with rage, disbelief and grief"" at the junta's takeover.He put his own writing on the back burner in order to concentrate on translating works by fellow poets writing from post-coup Myanmar - some of whom, like Khet Thi, have since been killed.Among them were Myint Myint Zin and K Za Win, both teachers, who died during a ferocious military assault on protesters in Monywa.Footage of security forces dragging away the body of K Za Win later went viral on social media.'A clear conscience'The transition to democracy ""liberated"" Burmese poetry, said Ko Ko Thett, making it ""more diverse in form and content, also more openly political.""Many have mobilised online in their battle against the junta, including an underground collective of 30 bards from across the country spreading their verse on Facebook.""There is so much crime against humanity (in Myanmar). Poets in such situations live with tears in every single breath,"" said one poet, who asked to remain anonymous for security concerns.""Our poems are hordes of screaming children.""Ko Ko Thett said he was ""numb with grief"" over the deaths of his fellow poets.All of them ""should have been noted for their poetry (but) got noted in the international media only after they got killed,"" he said.Khet Thi, the poet abducted in Shwebo, composed a verse two weeks after the coup to declare that he didn't want to be a martyr or hero.""I do not want to be a supporter of (the junta's) violence,"" he wrote.""If there is only one minute left to survive I want to have a clear conscience even for that minute."" - AFP"

The 2021 theme, “Natural Bonds” was inspired by the term “bonds” and our connection with nature while living in a world that now requires physical distance.Living in a time of pandemic-induced restrictions has changed our lifestyles. Staying home for months reconnected us with family and friends in different ways, and digital communication is the new normal. In the same way, many may feel a desire to reconnect with nature, and this season’s trend puts emphasis in the art of low-key flexing.Dressing well and looking presentable is so important, but so is being comfortable because that is what ultimately makes you feel confident. By incorporating the theme “Natural Bonds” into the brand’s vision for 2021, it is hoped that men and women will be inspired to get pandemic-friendly hair makeovers, whether it’s to chop off long locks, get bangs, or experiment with bolder hair colours.Read more: Optimism makes a comeback in the Spring/Summer 2021 fashion collectionsThe hair trend focuses on complementing smoky colours with natural un-dyed hair. While this is a low-maintenance hair colour design, the contrast adds dimension to the hair and overall style. For men, features include a solid bowl cut with shaved sides, dyed with taupe grey hair dye, adjusted with a clear agent, while maintaining a certain amount of natural black hair to complement the smoky colours. Style it with a mixture of gel and oil for a glossy, textured look.The female look is a bob with voluminous sides and laid-back, long bangs, meant to give off an effortless feel with ruffled texture.

The brand’s heritage is intrinsically linked to the high octane style of the red carpet with its expertise in designing luxury accessories that combine high fashion aesthetics with timeless elegance.The fragrance opens with a sparkling, citrus top note of mandarin juice contrasting with the suave velvety peach nuances. Red spider lily, a fascinating, almost hypnotic flower, with carnal and solar vanilla-like notes, blend in with the sensual vibes of jasmine sambac to reveal a determined and daring allure.The base notes of vanilla and benzoin, a duo of rich intense scents, anchor the fragrance in a deep, yet joyful way, leaving an intense vapor trail behind. The dynamic team of Sonia Constant, Antoine Maisondieu and Louise Turner worked as a trio, exchanging ideas and inspirations, choosing the red spider lily as the starting point of the fragrance for its beautiful red appearance and spider-like petals.The “I Want Choo” campaign emphasises the energy and intensity of the new, sensual fragrance as three friends get ready to party the night away. Gathered together in a dressing room, the three models, Madison Heardrick, Damaris Goodrie, and Yue Han bring the party to themselves, turning their home into their own personal club for dressing up and dancing.The bottle features a bold gold spray cap with a hammered jewelled effect and the JC monogram logo, all underlined by the soft and ultra-feminine peach tint of the fragrance, while its packaging shimmers in eye-catching vivid red glitter."
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",6:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,The planes of the future might not have pilots,"American startup Merlin Labs specialises in developing software solutions for autonomous piloting in aviation. It plans to equip a small fleet of jets so that they can fly without the assistance of a real pilot. Could this be the beginning of 100% autonomous commercial aircraft?After raising significant funding, Merlin Labs has concluded a deal with Dynamic Aviation to test and hopefully one day put into service its unmanned aircraft technology, capable of transporting goods as well as passengers.The startup's goal is to develop, in the very near future, a safe, fully digital, autonomous pilot system capable of taking control of an existing aircraft. As part of its agreement with Dynamic Aviation, the startup will supply its autonomous flight technology to 55 of the aviation services contractor's Beechcraft King Air aircraft. Merlin Labs is already conducting test flights over the Mojave Air & Space Port in California.While the technology promises fully autonomous navigation rather than remote control, remote ""supervisors"" would still be on hand to monitor the aircraft and make sure that everything runs smoothly.Note that aviation is a pioneer in this field, with autopilot technology in use in the industry for a long time. In fact, pilots often only really intervene during the takeoff and landing phases of a flight. In light of the possibility of human error (which is thankfully rare), Merlin Labs considers that a fully autonomous system would eventually be the safest. Working with an established company should help get its technology certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a necessary step in allowing this type of aircraft to fly officially in US skies. – AFP Relaxnews"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",5:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,"'Game of Thrones' prequel 'House Of The Dragon' is 'looking spectacular, ' HBO chief says","One question follows HBO and HBO Max content chief Casey Bloys gets everywhere he goes: What's up with all those Game of Thrones spinoffs?Bloys told Variety that he has been surprised by the number of people who believe that there are multiple GOT-related series in active production. For the record, House of the Dragon, a prequel that takes place 300 years before the events depicted in GOT, is the only spinoff that is real so far. GOT author George R.R. Martin is helping to oversee development on at least six other projects, including an animated series.""House Of The Dragon is the only one shooting,"" Bloys says. ""All the other ones are in various stages of development. People may think we have 10 series shooting at the moment. There's one that will be on the air in 2022. We'll see how the other scripts come along.""Dragon is now filming in England, led by showrunner/executive producer Ryan J. Condal and director/executive producer Migel Sapochnik, a GOT alum. Bloys wasn't giving out any spoilers but he likes what he's seen of the dailies so far. ""It looks spectacular,"" he said. ""The cast that (Sapochnik) and Ryan have put together looks good.""Dragon is based on Martin's novel Fire & Blood, a companion to the Song of Ice and Fire novels that were the basis for GOT. The prequel will follow the Dance of the Dragons, the Targaryen civil war between siblings Aegon II and Rhaenyra, who fought for the throne after the death of their father Viserys I. The Dance of the Dragons pits Westeros' great houses – including the Lannisters and Starks – against each other and resulted in the death of House Targaryen's most powerful dragons. Soon after the war, they would go extinct until Daenerys Targaryen would give birth to three dragons three centuries later.GOT was steered for eight seasons from 2011 to 2019 by showrunners/executive producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss. The pair were famously protective of the franchise. But they have now handed the keys to the kingdom to the Dragon team after signing a US$200mil production pact with an HBO rival.Benioff and Weiss ""have been entirely hands off"" on Dragon, Bloys said. ""They're off working at Netflix."" – Reuters"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",3:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,BERVIN CHEONG,Xiao Zhan and the rising fashion influence of Chinese stars,"While K-pop stars are certainly in-demand where fashion is concerned, let us not forget the influence of Chinese celebrities.Big names in China have a huge following too, and luxury brands are quick to capitalise on this. Xiao Zhan for example, was recently named as the ambassador for Tod's.The actor and singer will be bringing a fresh outlook to the classic Italian leather goods brand. He is described as having a ""powerful presence"", balanced with a ""unique charm"".Read more: Set to conquer the fashion world? BTS announced as ambassadors for luxury labelAlso known as Sean Xiao, the 29-year-old has starred in dramas such as Douluo Continent (2021), The Wolf (2020), The Untamed (2019) and Joy Of Life (2019).His April 2020 music single Made To Love set the Guinness World Record for the fastest-selling digital album within 24 hours of release. It had a sales volume of 25.48 million.Xiao Zhan's followers on Chinese microblogging site Weibo totals more than 29 million. He is also considered the most influential on the platform, with the most interactions.In the past, he has endorsed Estee Lauder's fragrance and beauty line. He made his runway debut for Li Ning in April this year.For the new Tod's campaign, he is photographed in a selection of limited-edition items.In one photo, he sports a chic hoodie, plus a new belt bag and sneakers, all designed just for him. For another look, he wears a blue navy T-shirt paired with a classic suede shirt jacket and casual-styled sneakers – further matched with a sling bag.China's influenceThis is not entirely a new thing for Chinese celebrities though. Earlier this year, Mulan star Liu Yifei was named as the face of Louis Vuitton in China.Other luxury brands looking East (specifically China) include Burberry, Cartier, Fendi, Christian Louboutin, Emporio Armani, Tiffany & Co and more.Although, the phenomenon isn't so much about global appeal – rather, a testament to the spending power of Chinese consumers.In November last year, Forbes reported that China is headed to be the world’s largest luxury market by 2025.Read more: Billie Eilish, Naomi Osaka and other celebs to headline fashion's Met GalaA research report jointly published by Bain & Company and Tmall Luxury Division in December stated that while the global luxury market shrank by 23 percent in 2020, mainland China’s market share nearly doubled.

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",2:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,ANDREA FILMER,Malaysian author begins her fantasy trilogy with an epic slice of 'Amok',"Until very recently, all secondary school students faced the big question: science stream or arts stream?For many, it was a no-brainer. And often, not really a choice.Whether or not one intended to pursue a career in the sciences, students who scored in the then PMR examination at the end of Form 3 were generally directed into the science stream unless they made a particular objection.Anna Tan made a particular objection.ADVERTISINGGrowing up in Tanjung Bungah, Penang, the Methodist Girls’ School student did not exactly know what she was going to spend her life doing, but science wasn’t it.“I made the controversial decision that I did not want to go to the science stream, although (people said) that’s ‘where all the smart girls go’.“I remember doing those career guidance and personality tests and the question that came up was if you don’t go into the science stream, what are you going to do? What career can you have if you’re an arts stream student? It’s terribly biased, I know, ” recalls Tan, Malaysian Writers Society (MYWriters) president and author.A bookworm from a young age and a self-professed homebody, Tan did briefly consider jobs that had something to do with the English language.“However, the main career choices mentioned were journalism or teaching – both of which are really fine careers but are people-centric jobs, which tend to stress me out. I figured I liked numbers and was pretty good with them so why not accounting?“There may have been some parental nudging involved since my dad also used to be an accountant. So, the consensus was accounting was a safe, stable career and the writing thing could be done on the side, ” she says.Thus, into the auditing world Tan went.Starting off at KPMG and then moving on into internal auditing at semiconductor manufacturing corporation Atmel, Tan spent nearly a decade working in auditing, which she ironically points out involves a great many people.“I learnt that it meant having to deal with many, many people too, but they do not tell you this at the start!“Anyway, nearly a decade into audit, it got to the point where I couldn’t see my career path. I enjoyed the work, but when the ‘where do you see yourself in five years’ question came up in performance reviews, I could not see myself in a senior manager role, ” says Tan.With a healthy savings account as well as some editing and publishing credits already under her belt, Tan decided to take a leap into the unknown in 2015.Teaspoon PublishingBe it Carrie Bradshaw leisurely typing beside an open window or Oscar Wilde relishing the freedoms of Paris, there is often a romanticised image of those who write and create books.Penang-based Tan, 37, says nothing could be different from reality.In fact, even as her publishing company Teaspoon Publishing turns four this year, she would hardly call herself a full-time writer.“(Being a writer is) stressful! I don’t know if I technically count as a ‘full-time writer’. I do more editing and formatting jobs with Teaspoon Publishing than actually sitting down and writing my own novels.“Unless you have already built up a huge backlist that is paying you a steady and sustainable income or you have other streams of passive income or funding, there is no way you can be a full-time fiction writer in Malaysia. You’ll always be looking for additional jobs on the side to cover expenses, ” she says.Tan, whose lists Terry Pratchett, Robin Hobb, CS Lewis and Zen Cho among her favourite authors, currently has two novellas (short novels) in the market, along with a healthy number of short stories and even a libretto (text in a musical or vocal work) which was her first major writing project.“I wrote a libretto called Star Of Persia in 2003 for a musical that was produced by FGA Centre.“I’ve been writing since school, so I’ve come out with a lot of stuff!My first published work was probably a short story in Phases, a youth magazine by Scripture Union back in the late 1990s.“But my first professional sale would likely be Codes in Fixi Novo’s Cyberpunk: Malaysia in 2015, ” she says.Participating in NaNoWriMo (the National Novel Writing Month initiative based in the USA) throughout college, Tan remembers a breakthrough in 2013 when she got the job to be the editor for the Love In Penang anthology published by Fixi Novo.After a couple years of freelancing, Tan heard about a former classmate who had been awarded a Chevening Scholarship and decided to throw her hat into the ring as well.This brought her to Brunel University London where she spent a year completing an MA in Creative Writing: The Novel, submitting the first 15 chapters of Amok to clinch the dissertation prize.The 'Absolution' trilogyA royal bloodline on which superhuman power is bestowed, a stunning queen from a former rival kingdom and predictions of doom and destruction from the priesthood fill Amok, Tan’s first full-length novel, which is available now.Set in a fantasy world that is loosely based on the Melaka sultanate, Malaysian readers will recognise distinct, homegrown elements sewn throughout Tan’s imaginary realm, including ranks of nobility, religious gatherings and the use of keris as weapons.“When I sent an early version out to beta readers, it was the Malaysian readers who found the words and terms the most jarring!As fantasy readers are used to conlang (constructed or fictional languages), my US and UK friends had very few problems with the terms, though I ultimately decided to add a glossary to aid with that.“When discussing my difficulty in choosing how to use certain terms depending on actual meaning, my editor was like: I didn’t know they were real words! I thought you made them up!” Tan laughs.She adds that in spite of the familiar references, the world created in her young adult novel is entirely imaginary.“As much as I use a historical Melaka sultanate as a jumping off point, it is not meant to be anywhere on earth.“One of the things the MA really got me delving into was the settings of my stories. Why did I default to a Eurocentric fantasy world and terms? What could I do to take it out of that? What does being Malaysian really mean?”Tan acknowledges that international publishing houses are starting to celebrate and push for diverse voices, looking for writing from cultures all over the world.“What was I doing recreating white countries?” she asks.Amok, which follows young Putera Mikal on his journey to fulfil a prophecy, will be followed by The Tale Of The Hostage Prince, set for release in December, and Absolution, which interestingly enough, was the first novel of the series that Tan wrote.“I pitched it to several agents and editors, even in some competitions. I had full requests and it was one of the finalists for The Future Bookshelf project (by publishing company Hachette Book Group) in 2018, but it never quite fit anywhere.“At the time, a friend of mine was retelling the story of Moses... in space. And I was like, well, this whole supernatural strength thing I’d been mooting has some relationship to Samson and Delilah, what can I do with that? That’s how the early outline of Amok came about, ” says Tan, adding that in order to suit the new background of the book series, she spent two months completely redrafting the original Absolution during a residency at the Rimbun Dahan arts centre last year.Both remaining books in the trilogy are in the editing stage and the whole series will be self published by Tan’s Teaspoon Publishing.“Self-publishing was a very deliberate choice from the start, though I’ve wavered back and forth on it in the interim.“Part of it is the control but mostly it’s the fact that there are no publishers in Malaysia that specialise in the fantasy genre in English.""The local English market tends to be pulp, horror or historical fiction circa WWII. I did look at getting traditionally published overseas, but that is a very long, arduous journey, ” she adds.On the future, Tan, who heads the MYWriters group and is the primary editor for local branch MYWriters Penang’s annual zine NutMag, says expanding the local fantasy genre in the country is one of her long-term goals.“I keep complaining about there being no fantasy publisher in Malaysia and it’s on the bucket list to be able to do that with Teaspoon Publishing eventually, ” says Tan."
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",11:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,CHESTER CHIN,"From The Archives: Coliseum Cafe, a slice of Malaysian history for 99 years","News that the 99-year-old Coliseum Cafe is shutting down for good has caused dismay amongst Malaysian foodies and historians alike. This 2014 story by our Travel writer Chester Chin perfectly encapsulates just why it is such a huge loss to our country's heritage.This story originally appeared in StarLifestyle on 31 August 2014, and has been edited for brevity and clarity.The sconce on the stained wall at the back of Coliseum Café’s dining area hasn’t lit up for a while now. But the lamp’s faulty nature isn’t reason enough to warrant a brand new replacement - not when the item in question is a relic that’s almost a century old.The Western colonial-themed restaurant has been operating since 1921 and in many ways, its dated interior mirrors just that. Antiquated furniture adorns the old mosaic tiled floor, accentuating nostalgia in this quaint venue along the bustling Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman in Kuala Lumpur.At one point during our conversation, the restaurant’s operation manager Jufri Kenneth Abdullah lifts up the tablecloth to reveal the aged wooden surface of the table we are seated at.ADVERTISING“For your information, this is 100 years old. This is the same table used back in the restaurant’s early days, ” he reveals, “and so is that coat hanger, ceiling fan and bar top.”He adds that the bar section of the restaurant - once off-limits to the fairer sex - resembles the original arrangements in the 1950s. Framed advertisements from the 1920s and 1930s still hang above the area today.The reason for preserving the café the way it was is history, he says.It’s an incredibly practical logic when you consider that Coliseum Café has weathered many significant milestones in the country.The restaurant stood tall throughout the British colonial rule, the Japanese occupation, Malaya’s independence, the formation of Malaysia and, if you want to put things in a more modern context, the millennium.“In the early days, Coliseum was more of an exclusive dining place. You had to be in proper attire - coat and tie - to dine in. These days, people can just come in shorts and T-shirts, ” Jufri Kenneth says.According to him, the restaurant used to be a favourite haunt among the British colonial crowd when it first opened. By the 1950s, planters and tin miners reportedly gathered on Friday evenings to discuss anti-communist strategies.“Today, we place ourselves as a casual family dining restaurant, ” stresses Jufri Kenneth.Coliseum Café has withstood the test of time. In 2013, the restaurant opened its second outlet at Plaza 33 in Petaling Jaya and was recognised by the Malaysia Book of Records as the “Longest Operating Western Colonial-Themed Restaurant”. They also added a third outlet at Mid Valley Megamall in Kuala Lumpur. In 2014, the venue celebrated its 93rd anniversary in the local culinary scene.Reportedly started by a group of business partners from Hainan Island in China, the restaurant has seen its fair share of famous diners, including the first Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.Acclaimed cartoonist Datuk Mohammad Nor Khalid, endearingly known as Lat, even left behind caricatures of customers who have dined at the venue.Of course, the food is a big part of the draw.“What you see here are all retained from the past, ” Jufri Kenneth says of the menu.The perennial favourites, he says, are the baked crabmeat, homemade oxtail soup, Hainanese fried noodles and “anything that has to do with sizzling”. Of course, one can’t possibly disregard the Hainanese chicken chop - an aspect that’s as ubiquitous as the old Hainanese cooks who prepared them in the past.Although it primarily catered to the British when it first opened, Jufri Kenneth is an ardent believer in Coliseum Café being a thoroughly Malaysian restaurant today.“The Hainanese brought their own style of cooking, the Indians brought the spices and some Malay cooking influences make the food served here Malaysian cuisine.“Dining at Coliseum is actually a walk down memory lane. My father used to bring me here when I was a boy. Back then, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman was known as Batu Road and it was a two-way street.After a brief pause, he adds: “I bring my kids here and eventually, I’m sure they will bring theirs too.”"

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Food,IAN LAU - RETRO RECIPE,Fruit-filled royal treat,"PUDING raja or royal pudding gained popularity when the current King’s reign began in 2019.Naturally, it was the dessert served during His Majesty’s installation banquet at Istana Negara.This sweet treat comes from Pahang where it was originally served to the royal family at their palace in Pekan.The recipe was compiled by the Queen herself in her book titled Air Tangan Tengku Puan Pahang.The dish is traditionally served during Malay weddings and festivals as well as during Ramadan.The main ingredient is a small, sweet local banana called pisang lemak manis, but you may substitute it with pisang emas.Unlike many other fried banana recipes where the fruits are sliced first, this calls for the bananas to be fried whole. Be careful when lifting the bananas out of the oil because they get extremely soft and mushy when hot.The most time-consuming component of this dish is the jala emas or golden threads.Although these are available ready-made from many online vendors, you can determine the sweetness level and which egg to make it with if you make them yourself.It is recommended that you use the yolks of duck eggs but chicken egg yolks would work as well.The only difference is the richness in the flavour that you get from duck egg yolks.The other usual garnishes are prunes, crystallised cherries and cashew nuts.Dates can also be added for additional sweetness, as well as walnuts and almonds.This dish is served with a custard sauce, and there are a few variations in the recipe.Some cookbooks call for whole eggs and a bit of water, others just use egg yolks.Although most would simmer the sauce directly in the saucepan, I prefer to whisk it in a double-boiler to make sure I don’t get lumps.When it has thickened, it needs to be refrigerated for about two hours, with a lid on so that the surface does not crust over.If it gets too stiff to pour after being chilled, just whisk in a tablespoon or two of cold water and it should flow when poured.Serve the royal pudding cold with the custard sauce on the side or poured generously over the dessert just before serving.Here’s wishing our Agong a happy birthday, and everyone can enjoy the holiday with a dessert fit for a king.Puding rajaIngredientsJala emas5 yolks from duck eggs1 cup sugar2 cups cold water1 pandan leafCaramelised bananas12 bananas, peeled1 tbsp butter or ghee2 cups cooking oilCustard sauce3 egg yolks3 tbsp sugar1 tin (390ml) evaporated milk1 tsp custard powder1 pandan leafGarnish100g prunes, seeded and halved25g red glacé cherries, halved25g green glacé cherries, halved125g cashew nutsMethodFor the jala emas batter, whisk egg yolks until fluffy, then strain through a wire sieve.Fill batter into a squeeze bottle with a narrow nozzle and set aside, or if you are using a jala mould, fill only when needed.Fill a saucepan with water, sugar and pandan leaf, and bring to a boil. Then remove pandan leaf and bring down the heat to a slow simmer.Drizzle batter into the simmering syrup from a height to get fine strands in a circular motion starting from the outer wall of the saucepan into the centre.Allow the strands to cook for about 30 seconds before lifting them out with a slotted ladle or chopsticks.Repeat four or five times with the remaining batter.For the caramelised bananas, heat cooking oil with butter or ghee.When oil reaches frying temperature, add bananas in whole and fry on all sides until light golden.Drain excess oil on kitchen paper.

"Sunday, 23 May 2021",6:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Young people more likely than boomers to try lab-grown meat,"Steak, rare? Why not, as long as it's grown in-vitro. That's the conclusion of a study published last week regarding attitudes to consuming meat grown in a laboratory.Conducted collaboratively by two American universities and one British, the study, available in the Foods journal, aims to understand the state of mind of different generations facing the emergence of alternative meat production. These in-vitro proteins are made from animal cells and then grown in test tubes. This type of cultivation presents an alternative to traditional breeding whose consequences on the environment are disastrous.The younger the generation, the more in favour of in-vitro meatTo find out more about perceptions of what not long ago seemed like a meal out of a work of science fiction, the researchers interviewed adults of different age groups.ADVERTISINGThe study was conducted on representative samples of the American and British populations. And appetites vary depending on the generation. About 89% of GenZers are inclined to consume it and have a positive view of the subject. A similar percentage is found among millennials (85%).Boomers, on the other hand, are less open, with just 77% ""at least somewhat open"" to trying lab-raised meat.In vitro meat vs farmed meatOn average, those who took part in the study said that this new type of protein could make up 37-42% of their diet's meat in the future.Generally, answers suggested that many expected farmed meat to remain on their plates and that this new form of protein would make up a ""partial, rather than full, replacement for meat"".In their study, the researchers found that ""despite growing evidence of the environmental and public health threats posed by today's intensive animal production, consumers in the west remain largely attached to meat.""It is therefore difficult to predict whether this type of meat will become widespread. It will be necessary above all to convince a public that has been fed on farmed meat, although it may become easier as younger generations become purchasers for their households. – AFP Relaxnews"
"Tuesday, 11 May 2021",,Food,,Meaty goodness fit for the grill,"DAGING harimau menangis is a direct translation of the original Thai dish, sua rong hai, or in English, crying tiger beef.It is a barbecued dish of heavily seasoned beef served with a spicy dipping sauce, and usually eaten as a lettuce wrap or with steamed rice.Its name is derived from local anecdotes on cattle that had been mauled by tigers and the carcasses then recovered from the jungle.Villagers would collect the remains,usually the brisket or bottom sirloin – parts which the tiger was said to have left uneaten due to the bones obstructing the flesh.ADVERTISINGAccording to the folklore, since the tigers were deprived of the enjoyment of these parts of the beef, they were said to cry, hence the name of the dish.It is also said that the beef brisket, called tiger meat in Thailand, consists of layered meat and fat which resembles tiger skin.And as the meat is charbroiled, the dripping fat resembles teardrops, in addition to the stripes of the grill marks, all of which also allude to the tiger’s ‘presence’ in the dish.Daging harimau menangis made headlines recently when a businesswoman tried to patent the name.Even after she retracted her bid, the social media storm that followed not only brought greater awareness of this dish, it also entrenched its Thai origins.This dish is very popular in many Thai food courts and street stalls, with each vendor boasting their own unique recipe.The standard marinade consists of salt, sugar, pepper and fish sauce, with the addition of soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic or coriander in its many variants.The brisket cut of meat is one that contains a lot of connective tissues, so you either have to cook it very slowly over a long time, or briefly at very high heat, to no more than medium.Another way to tenderise it is to pound it with a mallet to break down some of the long and criss-crossed fibres.The recipe is so simple that anyone can prepare this dish at home.The meat just needs to be marinated for about half a day until it is almost cured.Then, briefly charbroil over an open fire or grill in a cast-iron skillet, keeping the meat medium-rare.It can also be grilled in the oven but it will be harder to control its doneness.It is served with a spicy dipping sauce, variants of which may include chilli flakes, tamarind and palm sugar instead of fresh chillies, lime and sugar.This is an excellent dish to grill at the table if you have a hibachi or electric grill at home.Served hot off the grill, these morsels of meat wrapped in lettuce are a great communal dish.Sua Rong Hai/ Daging Harimau Menangis/ Crying Tiger BeefMarinade500g beef brisket4 cloves garlic1 tsp black pepper2 tsp salt4 tbsp oyster sauce3 tbsp fish sauce3 tbsp kicap manis4 tbsp brown sugarThai-style dipping sauce6 cloves garlic10 pods green bird’s eye chilli3 tsp oyster sauce2 tsp fish sauce3 tsp brown sugarjuice from 1 lime1 shallot, finely sliced2 pods red bird’s eye chilli, finely sliced1 sprig coriander, mincedMethodSlice beef to half-centimetre-thick strips.

"Sunday, 09 May 2021",,Food,ABIRAMI DURAI,Modern working mums are finding that a little help in the kitchen goes a long way,"For centuries, mothers in Asia have played pivotal roles in home kitchens across the continent. From China to India to Malaysia, women have been the arteries pumping life into the heart of traditional home-cooked meals, which they dutifully churned out day after day to feed their hungry families. In many instances, this responsibility was fulfilled largely out of obligation and in response to what had become a clearly defined gender role.In Baba Nyonya communities for instance, recipes were often tightly guarded by family matriarchs who only passed them down the female line i.e. to their daughters or daughters-in-law.This gender-based hierarchical structure led to the development of old-fashioned platitudes like ‘The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach’ and ‘Cooking is how a mother expresses her love’ and more derogatory expressions like ‘A woman’s place is in the kitchen’ – all evidence that cooking was a predominantly female-led activity (whether a woman was interested in it or not).The oft-repeated trope that fathers were the breadwinners and heads of the household reinforced this belief that a woman’s role was to cook and clean and look after her children.ADVERTISINGBut as with many things in life, the passage of time has changed this previously set-in-stone pattern somewhat. It began in the mid 20th century with an increasing number of women getting access to higher education, which in turn led to an influx of women joining the workforce. This has carved out different paths for many mothers who now straddle the responsibilities of child-rearing and housework with the travails of working life.For contrast, in 1970, female labour force participation in Malaysia was 30%. In 2020, it was nearly 56%. The increase in the number of full-time working mothers over the years (and mothers who work part-time, freelance or run their own home businesses) has had a trickle-down effect in terms of the structure and means in which feeding a family has changed.In 2021, many busy mothers have discovered that in order to provide nutritious meals for their families, a little help, some innovation and adaptation (and a few cheat days) go a long way towards satiating their children.Feeding the familyWhen business development manager Ong Leah Lee married her husband Kelvin Tan, the couple mostly ate out in restaurants or went to Ong’s mother’s house for home-cooked meals. But once they became parents, Ong and Tan decided that things had to change drastically if they wanted their children to grow up eating healthy, nutritious meals.Which is why Ong and her husband now take turns making the daily meals for their four-year-old daughter Helena Tan and nine-month-old son Ethan Tan. This way, they can split the cooking duties evenly so the onus isn’t always on one person and whoever isn’t cooking gets to spend quality time with the children.“I work from home at the moment and so does my husband and we both normally finish around 5pm. We have a live-in nanny who looks after the children and handles their daily lunch, but for dinner, my husband and I decide who will take over the cooking for the day.“We are quite fair about this division and split it according to the meal we feel like having for the day. He is good at cooking Western meals, so he is in charge of that and I am more influenced by the Chinese-style meals my mother taught me, so I often cook that. Kelvin also likes baking, so he makes a lot of desserts, kuih and even fresh bread for our breakfast daily.Ong says her daughter also enjoys helping out, which is why she fully intends to teach both her children how to cook when they are older.“My daughter is always saying, ‘Mum, can I help you do this?’ when I am cooking. So I plan to train her and her brother to cook from a young age, so this becomes a family activity, ” says Ong.Legal counsel Lynn Ann Johnson has also discovered that it takes two to get everyday meals going, especially when parents have equally busy jobs.Lynn and her husband Noel Anthony Raj used to eat out frequently at restaurants or order food in, as they both have demanding jobs.Everything changed once they had their daughter Nicole Alena Raj, 8, though. These days, Lynn and her husband run a tight ship and have a schedule mapped out between the two of them, so that the family gets healthy, home-cooked meals every single day.“How it works for us is if I’m making a big meal over the weekend, I freeze it and keep it so this lasts a couple of days over the week. But if that runs out, then my husband and I have this shift going. I wake up at 4am every morning and sort breakfast and lunch out for everyone and then take my daughter to school.“My husband comes back earlier than me in the evenings, so he gets dinner going, whether that’s making a fresh batch of pasta or a rice-based meal. And that’s how we work throughout the weekdays. On the weekends, we visit either his parents or my parents, and both our mums always make food for us to pack and take back, so that also lasts through part of the week sometimes, ” says Lynn.Lynn says without her husband pitching in, her family simply wouldn’t be able to enjoy home-cooked meals every day, as between the traffic jam and her long commute, she is simply too exhausted to cook every single meal every single day.“Oh, it definitely helps because I cannot get back home in time to make dinner. I finish work at about 6.30pm and I am stuck in traffic for at least two hours en route back home, so cooking at that time is a pointless exercise.“So we’ve done this for years, because we don’t have help. It’s just the three of us at home, so we’ve got a really good schedule where we take turns, because if not, we’d go mad, you know?” she says, laughing.For insurance agent Shamini Krishnan, cooking is a task that she has become extremely adept at, having cooked for her dad for years before her children Suvharn Raj, five, and Pavhaarn Raj, two, were born.As her husband Theeban Raj works long hours and often comes home late, Shamini and her domestic helper craft the family’s daily meals together.Still, she finds that it takes discipline to juggle work and cooking, which is why she plans the family meals at least a day in advance and makes sure her fridge is always stocked up with essential ingredients.“Every day from 9am to 1pm, I manage my insurance appointments. I also have a business as a reseller, so I try and do all my work within those hours. After that, if I have no appointments, I will cook lunch. If I cannot manage the cooking, I make sure that I prepare all the ingredients on alternate days, so my helper can do the cooking and I can continue working.“I normally also cook dinner and take charge of all the weekend meals, but if I’m not around, my husband takes over the cooking. But I actually enjoy cooking so it’s basically about managing my time well, ” she says.Khairun Nisa Mohamed Zabidi, a sustainability expert who is the head of the UK Partnerships for Accelerated Climate Transitions (PACT) programme at the British High Commission KL, has discovered that as a single mum, leaning on her extended family has helped immeasurably in ensuring that her children Aidan Salahuddin Conrad, 9, and Aria Khadija Conrad, 7, are fed.“I live 10 minutes away from my parents’ house so my kids spend a lot of time with them and have their daily lunches and dinners there. At the beginning of the pandemic, I did try making lunch for them but it was just too tiring to do that, clean up after and work as well – it was driving me up the wall, so I stopped, ” she says.Over the weekends, Khairun does sometimes cook, but more importantly, she has taught her kids how to cook so that they are self-sufficient and can whip up a meal if the need arises.“I taught my kids to cook a few years ago and they come grocery shopping with me too, so they always know what’s in the pantry. I have been doing this with them since they could read.“So like a couple of weeks ago, I got really sick and couldn’t cook, so my son made some pasta for the family meal, ” says Khairun, with pride.What’s cooking?All the mums I spoke to grew up eating mostly traditional Asian food – whether that was rice and curry, Chinese-style steamed fish and soups or Malay lauk.But since having children of their own, many have deviated somewhat from traditional recipes, given their workloads and the time constraints that they face in this busy modern world.“Oh I think people are definitely deviating from traditional recipes. Like I have my mum’s recipe for chicken curry and it’s all from scratch. She doesn’t use store-bought meat curry powder – she actually grinds everything on her own. If I were to follow the recipe to a tee, it would take forever! And it defeats the purpose to buy a pre-mix pack and make chicken curry, because it’s just not the same, ” explains Lynn.Which is why Lynn and her husband make a lot of quick, easy, healthy meals instead, like pastas, salads and wraps, which can be made fresh and fast. She also uses her oven and air-fryer a lot and avoids oily, fried food or fast food.“There are some days though when we are too tired or too lazy and we actually just have a sandwich and we are okay with that sandwich, because it’s a proper, full-on egg or tuna or roasted chicken sandwich and it only takes about 15 minutes to make, ” says Lynn.Ong and her husband meanwhile either make Chinese food or Western meals, depending on who is doing the cooking for the day.“Everything we cook is fresh and spontaneous, sometimes we have traditional Chinese food like stir-fried vegetables and steamed fish. And sometimes we make quick Western food like pasta. My daughter likes soup noodles, so I make that for her every day as it’s quite easy – I just need to make the soup and throw in vegetables, meat and noodles.“We want the kids to have a balanced diet, so all our meals have a lot of vegetables and protein, like fish. We eat a lot of fish, ” she says, laughing.Ong also adds that although she uses her mother’s traditional Chinese agak-agak style recipes, she has modernised it somewhat with the use of implements like pressure cookers.“I actually think cooking all these traditional dishes is much easier now, we can modernise the recipe and use tools like blenders and pressure cookers. Also there are better ingredient choices, so overall even though we have less time, we can do more efficient cooking, ” she says.For Khairun, her priority is simply ensuring that her kids are fed, although she does try and get them to eat healthy meals. While she often might make salads and roast a fish or chicken for her children, there are also days when she utilises cooking sauces to expedite the process of making traditional Asian meals.“I have a stack of premix cooking sauces and I just add some meat or vegetables to that, and typically these meals will be the same as what my mum used to make when I was growing up – rice, one or two meat dishes and a vegetable dish, ” she says.Shamini on the other hand, works hard to ensure her sons enjoy their meals, which is why she strives to make a varied range of Asian dishes to suit her kids’ preferences and tastes.“I think when we were young, we just ate whatever our mothers cooked – I mean, I ate rice and Indian dishes every day as a kid. But children now can be very picky. My five-year-old will ask me, “Amma, what have you cooked today?’ and go and see what is on the table. If he likes it, he will eat it, if he doesn’t, it is very hard to get him to eat it.“So I look up a lot of different recipes on YouTube and vary the meals accordingly. Like my youngest likes vegetables so I might make stir-fried vegetables with prawns for him while my eldest likes more robust dishes like ayam kicap, so I will make that for him.“I try and mix and match and make colourful meals because I want my kids to be happy and enjoy their meals, even though it takes more time and effort to do this. But when my five-year-old son comes up to me and says, ‘Amma, you are the best cook’, that just melts my heart, ” she says."

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,Tech,ZOE SAGALOW,Insurers ask: Who pays when self-driving vehicles crash?,"The advent of self-driving cars is raising questions in the insurance sector about who should pay when the vehicles crash and how insurers will set equitable rates.When cars can operate themselves, the central question will be whether accidents are the manufacturer’s responsibility and therefore covered by product liability insurance, or whether the fault would lie with the driver and be covered by personal auto insurance.While even today’s most advanced cars aren’t fully autonomous, experts say such cars are coming and the insurance question will only become more urgent. When a Tesla crashed near Houston, Texas last month, killing the two occupants, the initial focus was on Tesla’s self-driving technology, prompting CEO Elon Musk to deny that the car in question had those capabilities.Musk said data logs showed the car didn’t have a full self-driving computer installation and the automaker’s separate “Autopilot” feature wasn’t enabled. Tesla says Autopilot requires active driver supervision and that no Tesla cars are completely autonomous. Police said no one was in the driver’s seat when the car crashed into a tree.But there are other examples of autonomous vehicles gone wrong. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it launched investigations into 34 crashes related to advanced driver-assistance systems, mostly involving Tesla vehicles but some involving models from Cadillac, Volvo, Lexus and Navya, a French firm that is developing self-driving shuttles.Robert Passmore, vice-president of auto and claims policy at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, a trade group, said if there isn’t a human driver to ask, insurers will need to collect information from vehicles such as speed and when systems became aware of the person, vehicle or object with which they collided. Most cars already keep information about crashes in an event data recorder.The association is lobbying US Congress to give insurers access to vehicle data, which it says will support increasing automation of cars.Passmore said the coverage might vary by circumstance. For cars with advanced driver-assistance features, the driver is still “responsible for the overall operation,” so liability would fall under personal auto. If the vehicle malfunctioned, the manufacturer’s product liability could be invoked – as already happens with standard cars. But even with a fully autonomous vehicle, individuals could have liability exposure if they didn’t do maintenance such as installing software updates, he added.Thomas B. Considine, CEO of the US National Council of Insurance Legislators, said there aren’t yet special legal or regulatory requirements related to personal insurance for autonomous vehicles. The US Uniform Law Commission – a national organisation of legislators and their staffs, judges, lawyers and professors that drafts model laws when states are seeking uniformity – considered creating one. But it ultimately decided insurance issues were complex and outside its scope, said Bryant Walker Smith, who worked on the idea.One reason is that the question isn’t yet ripe. There aren’t vehicles available yet with fully automated driving features, notes Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and expert on automated driving. Still, lawmakers and others are preparing for the day they arrive.Smith said Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Gary Peters, D-Mich., are among many working on autonomous vehicle legislation in Congress. Both are members of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.A Senate aide, who spoke anonymously to discuss planned legislation, said negotiations about self-driving cars and insurance “are currently ongoing in the Senate with stakeholders on the best path forward”.Although there aren’t fully autonomous vehicles ready for purchase, there are many being tested and even a few taking passengers on roads in Arizona.Waymo LLC, Google’s self-driving car project that became a separate part of parent company Alphabet Inc, offers a ride-hailing service near Phoenix with fully autonomous vehicles, meaning there’s no one in the driver’s seat. The company is also testing the technology for trucking and local delivery.Volvo Car Corp preemptively announced in 2015 that it would accept full liability for cars in autonomous mode and still expresses that commitment.“When the future autonomous driving feature has been rolled out and is in use after activation by its user, Volvo Cars will take full responsibility, and assume liability, for it,” spokesperson Russell Datz said in an email.Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC, created in 2018, plans to launch self-driving services next year. The service will transport people and goods, but the company won’t disclose more details yet for competitive reasons, spokesperson Dan Pierce said in an email.Daimler AG and other companies, both traditional auto manufacturers and startups, are also working on testing and development.Liability risksSelf-driving technology could make cars safer and reduce manufacturers’ liability, which are motivating factors for research, although it’s unclear exactly how much safer.Insurers have billions of miles of data on human drivers but far less for autonomous fleets, said Max Libman, a lead underwriting consultant at Liberty Mutual Insurance Co, during an online event organised by Partners for Automated Vehicle Education, a coalition of auto manufacturers and nonprofit groups focused on issues such as safety and sustainability.The first goal is to reduce fatalities, and “along with that is a reduction in frequency and severity of losses, which should [lead] to less expensive auto insurance”, Steve Miller, risk management consultant at the Insurance Office of America, which employs independent agents, said during the webinar.SAE International, founded as the Society of Automobile Engineers in 1905, defines five levels of self-driving. Levels 1 and 2 involve driver support features widely available today, such as automatic emergency braking, lane departure warnings, lane centering or adaptive cruise control. Level 3 means a person must drive some of the time, depending on the situation. Level 4 means a car operates on its own under limited conditions, and Level 5 means it can operate everywhere in all conditions.Other than Waymo, which says it has a Level 4 system, cars with Level 4 and Level 5 features might not be available until 2040 to 2050, according to James Lynch, chief actuary at the Insurance Information Institute, whose board is made up of industry executives. That horizon is much further away than some had previously expected.Meanwhile, the life insurance industry is studying effects that autonomous vehicles could have on claims, said Catherine Theroux, a spokesperson for financial services consulting firm LIMRA.There were 1.10 traffic deaths per 100 million miles driven in 2019, according to NHTSA, down from a rate of 1.14 the previous year. Preliminary data from last year, when people stayed home more than usual because of the pandemic, shows fewer deaths but far fewer miles driven, so the fatality rate actually rose to 1.25 for the first half of the year.Most auto accidents result from driver error, so using more autonomous vehicles would likely reduce traffic deaths, Theroux added. Still, it’s too early to determine how the technology might affect life insurance premium rates.“The current view is that there may be an initial increase in accidental deaths as the degree of vehicular autonomy increases and design changes are tested and refined,” Theroux said in an email. “However, longer term, the expectation is that autonomous vehicles will reduce driver error significantly.” – CQ-Roll Call/Tribune News Service"
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",10:42 PM MYT,Tech,,"U.S. officials up pressure on firms, foreign adversaries over cyberattacks","WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. officials on Sunday ratcheted up pressure on companies and foreign adversaries to fight cybercriminals, and said President Joe Biden is considering all options, including a military response, to counter the growing threat.The Biden administration is looking at ""all of the options,"" to defend the country against ransomware criminals, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in an interview on Sunday, when asked if military action was being considered.Raimondo did not detail what those options could look like, but said the topic will be on the agenda when the president meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin this month. The rising threat of cyberattacks has pushed the Biden administration into a more aggressive stance against Russia, which is thought to be harboring some of the perpetrators.""We're not taking anything off the table as we think about possible repercussions, consequences or retaliation,"" Raimondo said.Last weekend, the world's largest meatpacker was targeted by cybercriminals and in May, the largest fuel pipeline in the United States was attacked, stoking fears over supply disruptions of food and fuel.U.S. adversaries have the ability to shut down the country's entire power grid, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said separately in an interview with CNN, noting ""thousands of attacks on all aspects of the energy sector"".The recent high-profile attacks have prompted Biden to put the issue of Russia harboring hackers on the agenda for his meeting with Putin.The White House plans to use the June 16 summit to deliver a clear message to the Russian leader, officials say. A next step could be destabilization of the computer servers used to carry out such hacks, some cyber experts say.U.S. officials are asking private companies to be more vigilant and transparent about attacks. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on Sunday said the May attack on Colonial Pipeline, which created temporary gasoline shortages, showed the national implications of a hack on a private company.""Part of our vulnerability on cybersecurity is you're only as strong as your weakest link,"" he said in an interview with CBS.Companies need to alert the federal government when they are targeted, Granholm said, and stop paying attackers. ""You shouldn't be paying ransomware attacks, because it only encourages the bad guys,"" she said.While she opposes ransomware payments, she said she is uncertain whether Biden or Congress is prepared to outlaw them.Companies should be required to report ransomware attacks, Democratic Senator Mark Warner from Virginia said on Sunday, though he stopped short of saying he supported making such payments illegal.(Reporting by Chris Prentice and Humeyra Pamuk in WashingtonWriting by Chris PrenticeEditing by Alistair Bell)"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Tech,QISHIN TARIQ,Get football fever with Fifa,"Given how popular football is as a spectator sport, its digital version too has become a heavily watched eSport.Played on Electronic Arts’s football simulator game Fifa, the videogame has been revamped over the years to include new consoles, improvements to the software and up-to-date player rosters in line with current football teams.Gamers have snapped up the many iterations of the game, with the Fifa franchise having sold more than 325 million units since first released in 1993. The latest version, Fifa 21, was released last October.While available on a wide variety of consoles as well as PCs, the pro league is played mostly on the latest generation PlayStation and Xbox consoles.Going for the goalWhile offline football is very much a team sport, EA’s Fifa puts the gamer in charge of the whole team, directly controlling the player who has possession of the ball. The defending gamer can switch controls between players to have the best chance of wresting back possession of the ball. The game AI fills in to control the remaining 10 players for each team.The game has various modes like Career Mode, where the gamer leads their team through a season as the general manager, or Kick-Off, where they can play a quick match against a friend or the computer. However, the professional leagues stick with the Fifa Ultimate Team (FUT) format.In FUT, gamers start with a random roster of players and play against others to earn in-game currency, which can be used to get packs that unlock new, possibly better players or to trade and buy players from others.There is also the option of buying in-game currency with real cash to more rapidly unlock content.Road to gloryBeyond unlocking game content, playing well also helps push gamers up the leaderboards. High ranking players get to participate in the special Weekend League, and if they win at least 27 of the 30 games there, they will be eligible to play in Online Regional Cups.The Regional Cups earn players Global Series Points based on their wins, with top ranked players moving on to the Regional Playoffs at the end of the season.Those who triumph there will get to go on the world stage and take part in the digital equivalent of the World Cup, called the FIFAe Club World Cup, which is generally available for free online through platforms like YouTube, Twitch and Facebook as well as its website Fifa.gg.The 2021 Zone finals ran from Feb 24 to 28, featuring 42 teams from six different zones including Oceania, Asia, Africa and Middle East, Europe, South America, and North America.Local heroesTwo Malaysian teams made it to the four-team finals for the Asia zone: Wicked Esports (made up of Faiq Iskandar ‘halowake’ Saiful Bahri and Muhammad Naim ‘DatoRentap’ Muhammad Hisham) and GBX Esports Team (consisting of Ahmad Shahrin ‘GBX_Ayen’ Shaharudin and Muhammad Luqman ‘LuqmanHzq’ Haziq Hajiman).After a round-robin stage, the two top teams – Wicked Esports and Blue United eFC from Japan – then competed in a knockout round.Unfortunately, the Japanese team edged out the Malaysians as the Asia zone winner, but Wicked Esports still walked away with US$8,000 (RM32,932) as runners up.Though GBX Esports Team’s run ended earlier, this wasn’t Muhammad Luqman’s first taste of elite level football eSports. He made history as the first South-East Asian player to advance to the FIFAe World Cup qualifying round in Barcelona, Spain in 2018.Two Malaysian sports commentators, Muhammad Hafiz Sudin and Matthews Izzac, were also chosen as representatives for the Asia zone to provide commentary during the 2021 FIFAe Club World Cup finals.To encourage local talent, the Malaysia Football League (MFL) had partnered with EA Sports last year to launch the eMFL, an officially recognised league. This year’s edition, which ran from April 20 to May 9, was sponsored by Telekom Malaysia and had a cash pool of RM50,000."

By using Bitcoin, the amount received by more than a million low income families will increase in the equivalent of billions of dollars every year.""He pointed out that 70% of El Salvador's population does not have a bank account and works in the informal economy.""This will improve lives and the future of millions,"" said Bukele.(Reporting by Nelson Renteria in San Salvador, Anthony Esposito in Mexico City and Juby Babu in Bengaluru; Editing by Marguerita Choy, Sonya Hepinstall and Michael Perry)"
"Saturday, 05 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Tech,,World's first smart bike tube shows you tyre pressure on your phone,"A new innovation for mountain bikes promises to make it much easier to get the optimal tyre pressure, allowing for the right grip and less rolling resistance.Austrian manufacturer Tubolito says its new, smart and lightweight inner tube is the world's first that can determine the air pressure inside your tyres to a tenth of a bar and send it to a phone.To see the current pressure, bikers just have to hold their smartphone up to the wheel at valve height.The tube is called the Tubo-MTB Psens and a small and flat pressure sensor is attached to the valve stem on the inside, along with an NFC chip that sends information to your smartphone that you can read in an app (Android/iOS). Here you can read pressure in bar and psi.The sensor doesn't need a battery. When the pressure is measured, the sensor gets power that was given to the NFC chip through induction from the smartphone.The sensor weighs only about 8 grams. In total, the tube made of thermoplastic polyurethane (PU) weighs no more than 90 grams (27.5 inches) or 93 grams (29 inches).The smart tube is not cheap, however, and a Tubo-MTB Psens costs 45euros (RM226.01) to order from Austria, where it's made.Light PU inner tubes are Tubolito's core business. Mountain bikers, but also road cyclists, save quite a bit of weight with a PU tube compared to ordinary butyl rubber tubes. The latter weigh around 200 to 220 grams in 29-inch size.In addition to Tubolito, Schwalbe (Aerothan) or Revoloop also offer PU inner tubes, which are priced at 25-30euros (RM125.56-150.67) without a sensor. In the event of a puncture, PU tubes can be repaired with special, self-adhesive patches. – dpa"

"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Tech,EMILY CHANG，DINA BASS,Snowflake CEO says diversity goal is secondary in hiring choices,"Snowflake Inc. Chief Executive Officer Frank Slootman said the cloud software maker needs to focus more on merit when hiring and promoting employees rather than diversity goals, even as it takes steps to boost opportunities for workers.""We’re actually highly sympathetic to diversity but we just don’t want that to override merit. If I start doing that, I start compromising the company’s mission literally,” Slootman said Thursday in an interview on Bloomberg Television.Other CEOs feel the same way about the need to reach a more ""moderated” approach to diversity, Slootman said, but are reluctant to say so publicly.His remarks stake out a position at odds with corporate America, where leaders are moving — at varying speeds, to be sure — to mirror the nation.Advocates for the diversity business case usually cite ongoing research from consultant McKinsey & Co. that has found that companies with more diverse leadership are more likely to outperform the profitability of those that are the least diverse.Slootman didn’t provide any details on the workforce at San Mateo, California-based Snowflake, which went public in September 2020 in the year’s biggest US initial public offering.""From my own experience talking to many CEOs privately, we are of the same mind, just publicly they find it hard to be that way,” Slootman, 62, said. ""We need to come to a more moderated, real place. There’s really no room for the hysteria and the outrage. We’re CEOs, we run companies, we have to produce results for our employees and our partners and our investors and our customers. We can’t get distracted in that mission. When you do, you might as well hang it up and let somebody else do it.”Over the past year, companies across tech and other industries have set ambitious hiring goals for Black employees and executives and pledged donations to non-profits working with underrepresented minorities.Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai promised to hire enough Black workers and managers to push Google’s numbers to 30% by 2025, while Microsoft Corp. said it would try to double the number of Black employees in senior and leadership positions during the same time period.McKinsey found the most gender diverse companies were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than the least gender diverse group. For ethnic diversity, the gap was 36%.The consultant stopped short of saying the relationship is clearly cause and effect, but that the correlation is strong and has improved over time.Diversity experts and tech workers have also questioned whether the industry’s much-vaunted ideal of meritocracy really rewards those who perform best or whether other factors are at play in evaluations that are supposed to be based on merit.Snowflake last year announced a council to examine the company’s ""diversity, equity, and inclusion practices” and make progress ""through innovative new ideas from across the entire organization.” The company didn’t release any workforce demographic data in its first annual report as a public company nor is that information listed on its website.Snowflake has a variety of programs meant to help people connect to opportunities, including aiding universities in designing curricula so graduates are ready for tech jobs, Slootman said.Slootman said the company is under greater pressure to perform because of its initial success on the public market. The stock has declined 15% this year and investors were disappointed last week with the company’s forecast.""We’re a very high-growth company at our scale, but also with a valuation to match so there’s obviously pressure on the management team to live up to that,” he said. ""It’s very rare to see the kind of growth that a company like Snowflake is experiencing.”Snowflake makes software that pulls information from multiple systems so clients can analyse it together in one place. It competes against and partners with the biggest cloud infrastructure companies.As many as 85% of Snowflake customers also use Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services, while Microsoft’s Azure is the fastest growing platform among Snowflake clients. – Bloomberg"

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,News,REBECCA RAJAENDRAM,SPM 2021 postponed,"PETALING JAYA: For the second time, Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) candidates will be sitting for their national examinations in the following year.Education Minister Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin said the oral and science practical exams for SPM 2021 will commence in February 2022 while the written exams will begin in March.“The ministry decided to do this after taking into account the current situation and challenges faced by the SPM 2021 exam candidates, ” he said during a press conference yesterday.“The ministry is confident the national exams, normally held in November pre-pandemic, will run smoothly as we already have experience from shifting the 2020 examinations to February 2021.”Radzi said for SPM 2020, the Malaysian Examinations Board had created a detailed standard operating procedure for conducting a public examination during a pandemic.The SOP, he added, saw an increase in the distance between tables, the number of invigilators and the number of classrooms used for the examinations in order to keep students safe from the virus.The number of candidates for SPM 2021 has not been finalised as registration only closes on June 18 but according to the ministry’s website, there are currently more than 14,000 Form Five students in the country.Over 40,000 students sat for SPM 2020 in February this year after going through nearly a full year of home-based learning.The Pakatan Harapan Education Committee and Opposition Parties also released a joint statement yesterday on the ministry’s manner in handling the SPM 2020 examinations.“The failure of the Education Ministry in managing SPM 2020 has caused unnecessary mental and physical stress to students, teachers and parents, ” said the statement signed by 10 opposition politicians, including former Education Minister Dr Maszlee Malik and former Deputy Education Minister Teo Nie Ching and former Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman.It said the SPM 2021 cohort will be the first to undergo the new exam format, announced only last year, and are also the first to use the new Secondary School Standard Curriculum (KSSM) that was introduced in 2017.The introduction of these new aspects, coupled with the disrupted school sessions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, would mean that SPM 2021 students would face bigger challenges than the SPM 2020 candidates, it stated."
"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",,News,,Tawau to wow the world ‘Soon’,"THE beauty of Tawau, Sabah, is set to greet international audiences, thanks to its famous son.A labour of love from award-winning filmmaker Soon King Yaw, work on the story that takes place in his hometown has started.The United States-based filmmaker is developing a tale that unfolds in Tawau to translate its beauty and serenity into film, and share it with the world.Besides his passion-driven project, Soon is currently busy with post-production work for When I See The Wind, a short film he is producing in collaboration with Bay-Area cinematographer Andrés Gallegos. The 29-year-old, who hopes to make feature films one day, attributes his success to his single mother’s perseverance and strong work ethics, which he said have shaped him to become who he is today. Do your best or don’t do it at all, she would say. Living by those words of wisdom, The One Academy graduate made headlines when his animated documentary was chosen as the opening film of the KQED Homemade Film Festival last year.Out of 500 submissions, his short flick All I Did Was Smile and Say Hello bagged one of the Top Five finalists’ spots. It also drew praise from guest judge and former president of the San Francisco Bay-Area Film Critics Circle Randy Myers.The film sheds light on the increased discrimination faced by Asian Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic.Soon’s other short films include My Mother, Myself & I, The White Crow, and Something Carved And Real – all of which have gained accolades and recognition.Currently residing in San Francisco, the creative talent with a keen interest in drawing, painting and music draws inspiration from the environment and the people around him.“I’ve learnt to be open-minded and receptive to all these nuggets of inspiration hidden in the monotony of everyday life. Sometimes when I walk by a scenic place, I would stop and imagine what kind of story I can tell there,” he said.Despite his success today, things have not always been rosy for him.As a teenager, he was forced to face the reality that most educational funds in the country did not offer financial assistance for students pursuing the arts.Upon completing his secondary education, he seized the opportunity to be an exchange student in the US for half a year through the American Field Service Youth Exchange & Study (AFS-YES) programme.It was there that he decided to pursue a career in art, thanks to inspiration drawn from his foster father, who is an artist. Exposure to a culture that appreciates and values the arts spurred him on as well.Upon returning, Soon was bent on securing a scholarship at The One Academy – he knew his mother could not afford the fees. He thus joined the Malaysia Top 10 Outstanding Young Artists Awards organised by the academy in hopes of winning the grand prize of a scholarship.On his first try, Soon clinched the third prize. A year later, he tried again but barely secured a placing, leaving him feeling disappointed.Although he had his mother’s support, he had to put up with scepticism from his relatives and teachers over his choice to study art.“I was told that I had wasted all my SPM A+s to pursue a hobby as a future career and an insecure one at that. Their disapproval made me doubt myself a lot, especially when they compared me to my friends who pursued technology, medicine and law,” he recalled.But his efforts proved to be worthwhile – on his third attempt, he was awarded the Best of the Best award, along with a scholarship to study digital animation.Soon cited Visual Storytelling as among the courses he found most inspiring at The One Academy.“It was here that I was introduced to the beauty of filmmaking. Upon the recommendation of a lecturer, my friends and I formed a team and joined a local competition. Despite having no prior experience in it, we won it.“I’m forever grateful for the lecturer who saw something in me that I didn’t at the time. I’m a filmmaker today because of him,” he shared.In a press release from the academy, Soon credited his technical skills to the industry-oriented syllabus at the academy that gave him a competitive edge over others.Upon graduating, he went on to further his studies in the US and later secured a job as a video editor at Electronic Arts (EA) in Redwood City, beating over 1,000 applicants for the position.Still holding the position now, he spends his free time producing and writing short films focusing on topics close to his heart."

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,News,,Radzi: Home-based learning to continue until further notice,"PETALING JAYA: Home-based learning (PdPR) will continue until the National Security Council decides otherwise, says Education Minister Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin.The programme will continue until schools reopen on June 13 and 14 for Group A and Group B schools respectively.Group A are schools in Johor, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu while the other states fall under Group B.“They (national schools) will undergo at least 25 days of PdPR until the (one week) mid-semester school holidays, which starts on July 16 for Group A and July 17 for Group B.” he said.Radzi added that international schools, private schools and expatriate schools must also carry out PdPR throughout the 25 days, based on their own academic calendar.He said the ministry will give one week’s notice before schools resume face-to-face classes.Exam year students will be the first to go back to school when it reopens.While noting teachers and students have problems completing the syllabus using PdPR, Radzi said the ministry had realigned the curriculum last year to three main components – basic content, additional content and complementary content.Thus, to ease the burden of completing the syllabus, he said teachers are required to focus on completing the basic content of the curriculum, that must be mastered by the students, before moving onto the other two components if they have the time.Regarding the Cerdik initiative, Radzi said the ministry has distributed 12,887 digital devices with data plans to 95 schools to date, with another 40,290 units to be distributed by June 12 and another 96,823 units by the end of September.The initiative, announced in Budget 2021, aims to provide 150,000 students from lower-income families with digital access in the form of laptops, tablets, and data connectivity.On another matter, Radzi said he has spoken to National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme coordinating minister Khairy Jamaluddin and that they hope to expedite the vaccine programme for teachers so that they can receive at least their first dose before schools reopen, possibly, at the end of July.More than 70,000 teachers have received at least their first dose to date.The Peninsular Malaysia Malay Students Federation president Mohd Alif Anas Md Noor welcomed Radzi’s announcement to continue with PdPR when schools reopen, saying that this would be a way to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among students.The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) said although the minister has stated that PdPR 2.0 is not set in stone, without an official directive, it will be “business as usual.”“The administrators will follow the circular on PdPR to the letter, the state education departments and district education will monitor the schools like a hawk and none will be the wiser,” its secretary-general Harry Tan said.Melaka Action Group for Parents in Education chairman Mak Chee Kin said it is wise to keep schools closed judging from the latest pandemic statistics.However, he questioned if PdPR was effective as there is no equal access to it across the board with device, Internet and availability of trained teachers being the biggest factors.Parent Action Group for Education Malaysia (PAGE) chairman Datin Noor Azimah Abdul Rahim said there needs to be continuous and consistent checks and balances by school leaders to ensure PdPR is of a high standard."
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Opinion,JOHAN JAAFFAR,Now’s the chance to get it right,"A FEW days before the national lockdown was announced, the social media platforms of the Mentri Besar of Selangor posted a question: Is the movement control order (MCO) necessary now?More than 150,000 people responded via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, overwhelmingly welcomed a lockdown. This is despite the state’s Covid-19 task force chairman’s view that a stricter lockdown is not the solution to contain the pandemic.Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad feels that there were more effective ways to contain the spread of the pandemic. He was calling for a more targeted and effective lockdown, coupled with mass testing. The idea is to identify and isolate those with the virus.Many experts will agree with Dr Dzulkefly under normal circumstances. But things have changed for the worse. The spike in the number of cases has put the state government in a dilemma.Mass testing, the very mechanism that is hailed as the right move forward, is responsible for the alarming numbers of those infected.In a long run, it will help the state. But for now, Selangor has to go through another round of stricter and more painful MCO just like the rest of the country.Health experts have cautioned the impending crisis for some time already.In an online conversation with Star Media Group adviser Datuk Seri Wong Chun Wai, Kumpulan Karangkraf chairman Datuk Hussamuddin Yaakob and I last week, Prof Datuk Dr Adeeba Kamarulzaman highlighted a study conducted by the Institute for Health Metric and Evaluation (IHME) of the University of Washington in the United States.The projection for Malaysia is alarming, the estimated death rate could be as high as 200 a day. The total death toll from Covid-19 may reach up to a staggering 26,000 by September.Dr Adeeba, formerly the Dean of the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), is currently a Science Council Member for the World Health Organisation.But some argued that this MCO is either half-hearted, half-baked or a half-measure. How strict is strict is a matter of semantics. There are simply too many exemptions to begin with.The city of Melbourne has implemented a total lockdown when 60 people tested positive to a more sinister variant called Kappa.Millions have to endure an extended lockdown after the first seven-day lockdown ended.The acting state premier of Victoria told reporters: “We’ve got to run this thing to ground, otherwise people will die.”Malaysia is seeing more than 8,000 new cases each day now. It is simply reckless not to take heed.We have seen how communities are infected. Most of us have seen family members, relatives, friends, colleagues and neighbours infected and sadly some succumbed to the virus.The virus is at everyone’s doorsteps.Lockdowns are hurtful and painful.In our case it has impacted the economy rather badly. Companies are winding up, people losing their jobs.The worst hit are those in the B40 category – Mak Cik Kiah included.The pandemic has shown another disturbing reality – inequality in wealth distribution. Those in the lower income group suffer much more than upper income Malaysians.We did right the first time. Everyone was on board in a ship traversing troubled waters. But we rejoiced too early.We were gleefully watching Singapore struggling with infections among its migrant workers. We did very well indeed that we let our guard down. We celebrated too early. We didn’t have an exit strategy. We inflicted upon ourselves the injury that we are dealing with now – the Sabah state election, our attitude and discipline, and many more.The people shouldn’t be blamed entirely. They wanted to move on with their lives. Lives must be saved, so too are livelihoods. Many were willing to make sacrifices and they did that.The government is partly to be blamed,too, for its indecisiveness, flip flops, and U-turn regarding policies and conflicting statements made by the ministers.We need to look at the surveillance and monitoring system. We have MySejahtera, which despite its occasional shortcomings should be utilised to the maximum. After all we have the capacity, the technology and the know-how.Experts have been talking about a holistic, all-in-society approach in dealing with the pandemic. Community engagement is critical. It shouldn’t be top-down approach all the time.Political parties must mobilise its machinery like the ones they have during elections – to reach out to the people. They must help withthe registration and vaccination appointments for the needy, especially the elderly in rural areas.Other than adhering to the SOP and to expedite the national immunisation programme, people must be part of the entire construct as stakeholders.This is our last chance to get out of this pandemic. We have no other options. We will have to make sure that this MCO is successful. Too much is at stake here. Let there be light at the end of the tunnel.Johan Jaaffar is a journalist, editor and for some years chairman of a media company, and is passionate about all things literature and the arts. And a diehard rugby fan. The views expressed here are entirely his own."

I shall forever be grateful to Yayasan Peneraju for sponsoring my study, ” he says.Tengku Ikram was also attracted by the graduation benefits, among them membership of a globally recognised accounting professional body, CPA Australia.Furthermore, as a father-of-two, Tengku Ikram also needed a study option that was flexible.As well as providing the option of test centre exams or online proctored exams in most locations globally, the CPA Program offers an online learning platform that includes extensive resources from business simulations, video resources and weekly webinars to module quizzes and downloadable study notes.“I could study anytime online, and the guided learning resources that map out a step-by-step learning journey throughout the semester include everything you need to help you achieve a great result in your exam, ” he says.Gaining a competitive edgeChengco PLT’s audit associate Chua Jie Sheng, who has gained high distinctions in Ethics and Governance, Financial Reporting, Strategic Management Accounting and Advanced Audit and Assurance, agrees the CPA Program has given him an edge in his career.“Rather than merely follow what was done in the past, the CPA Program prompted me to take a step back and think if there are better ways to perform my tasks.“For example, insights from Strategic Management Accounting have helped me manage the expectations of both internal and external parties and taught me about increasing job scope as technology improves and market demands change, ” he says.Chua believes the quality of the CPA Program’s learning resources outperform those of other qualifications.“My father who ran a multi-disciplinary professional service read my Strategic Management Accounting textbook and became so excited by the information – till we were fighting to use the book.“For a textbook to have such an impact on a businessman, I believe the subjects taught by CPA have quality and are applicable in the business world, ” he said.For more details on the CPA Program, attend one of the Become A CPA Information Session webinars.

They are often motivated by conspiracy theories, particularly about geopolitical powers and pharmaceutical companies,"" said Arman.Meanwhile, Universiti Putra Malaysia Teaching Hospital (HPUPM) Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, Medicine and Psychiatry lecturer Dr Ruziana Masiran said the existence of this anti-vaccine group started with the vaccine for smallpox in 1800.Ruziana is in agreement with Dr Arman’s view that their distrust toward the vaccine is because they do not understand or doubt the science or ingredients in the vaccine.She said the latest studies by Murphy et al. (2021) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, published in the leading journal ‘Nature’ found that those who rejected the Covid-19 vaccine received less information about the pandemic from authoritative sources.""The distrust has increased because there is a law that requires children to be vaccinated to enable them to attend public schools.""Unfortunately, the decision of this group of people not to vaccinate themselves or their children has contributed to the re-emergence of infectious diseases that have been or almost eradicated, ” she said, citing that measles was declared eliminated in 2002 but there was a resurgence in 2014. - Bernama"

There is also a small number of families who no longer need a nanny as the parents switched to working from home, ” he said.Chua also noted that the hiring process now was tedious and time-consuming, citing that the company had to pay for quarantine charges which may turn out to be a waste if the nanny candidate is not up to par.Another childcare and eldercare services company also said the monthly fee for a confinement nanny had gone up by 30%.“Some customers have no choice but to hire daycare or night care services that employ locals to help around the household, ” she said.> Sin Chew Daily reported that stock prices of restaurant chains near the Ueno Zoo in Japan jumped nearly 30% following news that a female panda was showing signs of pregnancy.The zoo, which reopened on Friday after five months of closure due to the Covid-19 pandemic, announced that panda Shin Shin might be pregnant after mating with male Ri Ri in March.Since May 23, she is said to have been eating less and resting more, which are pregnancy signs she had back in 2017 before giving birth to a female panda cub named Xiang Xiang.Local media reported that such signs are sometimes a false alarm but many are still hopeful for a bundle of joy.The news gave a welcome bump to shares in eateries near the zoo.Shares of Chinese restaurant chain Totenko jumped 29% on Friday – the largest leap in four years, before closing at a 9.4% increase from Thursday.Another establishment in Ueno –French restaurant Seiyoken – also saw better trading prices.The above articles are compiled from the vernacular newspapers (Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese and Tamil dailies).

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,News,,How the Agong is appointed,"THE Conference of Rulers is a unique institution that chooses the Yang di-Pertuan Agong from among its ranks of nine Malay Rulers.Although it was officially established in 1948, the Conference had a predecessor in the durbar, where the Rulers and the British administrators would meet during the days of the Federated Malay States.Following the country’s independence, the Conference of Rulers was established in accordance with Article 38 of the Federal Constitution which, among others, stipulated that it would elect Yang di-Pertuan Agong as the head of state.It would also elect the Deputy Yang di-Pertuan Agong.Its other functions are to agree or disagree to the extension of any religious acts; observances orceremonies to the Federation as a whole; consent or withhold consent to any law and making or giving advice on any appointmentwhich requires the consent of the Conference under the Constitution; appoint members of the Special Court; grant pardons, reprieves and respites or remitting, suspending or commuting sentences.It may also deliberate on matters of national policy and any other matter it deems fit. Its members comprise the hereditary monarchs of the states of Malaysia and the Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Melaka, Penang, Sabah and Sarawak.Only the Rulers of Negri Sembilan, Selangor, Perlis, Terengganu, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Johor and Perak are permitted to stand as candidates and elect the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.The appointment of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong has generally followed the tradition of rotation based on the first cycle of nine Rulers to have taken on the mantle.But the year 2019 saw an unprecedented event that could have broken that tradition when Sultan Muhammad V resigned as the 15th Yang di-Pertuan Agong midway through his five-year term.The next in line was the then Sultan of Pahang Almarhum Paduka Ayahanda Sultan Ahmad Shah but since he was ill at that time, it would not be suitable for the Conference of Rulers to appoint him as the next Yang di-Pertuan Agong.This matter was averted when Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah acceded the throne of Pahang with the abdication of Sultan Ahmad Shah, thus making him eligible to become the Yang di-Pertuan Agong."

Tuanku charmed the people even more when he was seen queuing up to buy a fast-food meal with his entourage.Sultan Abdullah showed his thoughtfulness further by issuing congratulatory messages to Malaysians through the Istana Negara social media channels to commend them on their every achievement.Last month, Sultan Abdullah congratulated dive queen Pandelela Rinong on winning the gold medal for the 10m platform individual event at the FINA Diving World Cup in Tokyo, and he did the same when shuttler Lee Zii Jia won the All England Badminton Championship title in March.Sultan Abdullah also congratulated students Cheryl Chow Shu Wei for earning the “Top In The World” Award for Chemistry in the International General Certificate of Secondary Education and Pavit Coran, who was crowned champion of the English Speaking Union International Public Speaking Competition.Tuanku is also not a stranger to bringing comfort to people hit by hardships and disasters.When floods struck several villages in Pahang earlier this year, Tuanku donned his military fatigues and waded through floodwaters to visit and give aid to the victims.During this time, Tuanku was accompanied by Raja Permaisuri Agong Tunku Hajah Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah and they helped to prepare meals for those housed at evacuation centres.During the political impasse early last year, the King and Queen once again showed their compassion by treating members of the press to a meal after they spent long hours waiting for updates outside the Istana Negara gates.The King’s attentiveness to his people’s needs has earned him praises and a special place in their hearts."

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,News,TARRENCE TAN,‘Be prepared to work with enemies’,"PETALING JAYA: Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim wants Pakatan Harapan to be open-minded, even in working with its “enemies” if it wants to retake Putrajaya.In a special address to PKR via Facebook Live yesterday, the Opposition leader also said that Pakatan must be ready to cooperate with all parties.“We shouldn’t be too harsh in rejecting all forms of cooperation.“Even now, as Pakatan, we are ready to cooperate with all of our friends from the Opposition.“But don’t try to seize power or continue with cronyism, issuing contracts without tender and such. That, we will not agree with.“We want cooperation with the Opposition parties and even other parties because we see there is tension in Perikatan Nasional now, ” he said.Anwar claimed that Perikatan is currently in disarray due to issues that cropped up recently, including the spike in Covid-19 cases.Recently, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s Parti Pejuang Tanah Air had declared that it was not interested in cooperating with PKR due to its baggage in the past, adding that the party would instead seek an alliance with Parti Warisan Sabah and the Malaysian United Democratic Alliance (Muda) in GE15.Murmurs of possible cooperation between PKR and Umno have also been in the political rumour mill recently, given the soured ties between Umno and Bersatu after Umno declared interest in leaving the Perikatan government.Speculation of cooperation was also rife when Pakatan and Umno had both issued press statements pressuring for Parliament to reconvene.Anwar said any form of cooperation must come with strict terms and conditions so that promises won’t be broken and the principles of good governance must not be compromised.“Leaders come and go but still, the problem remains where we are still entangled with issues on collecting wealth, stealing national treasures in the name of fighting corruption.“This cannot go on. If the people allow this to happen, this means our country will continue to be flooded with crises.”In March, DAP said that there will be no cooperation with Umno and Datuk Seri Zahid Hamidi has also declared that Umno would not cooperate with PKR.Anwar also called on DAP and Parti Amanah Negara not to escalate trivial matters pertaining to the use of the PKR logo in the next general election.He added that it is unwise to publicly argue over the logo at present, as leaders must focus on carrying out their duties and responsibilities to the rakyat amidst the worsening Covid-19 pandemic.“In such a situation, we should carry out our duties and cooperate closely, especially DAP and Amanah. Don’t let trivial matters escalate. “We will deliberate on any decisions, even on logos.“No one can force us and we cannot force them. That is our way and method.”The logo argument was sparked when PKR Youth chief Akmal Nasir proposed on Saturday for PKR’s logo to be used in GE15, just like in GE14 in 2018.DAP and Amanah members criticised the proposal.DAP’s Anthony Loke said that it was not the time to talk about the GE15 logo as they should focus on assisting the rakyat affected by the pandemic.Loke, who is DAP’s national organising secretary, claimed the matter was discussed at length at a recent Pakatan retreat in Port Dickson last April.“When the time comes, then Pakatan’s presidential council will make a joint decision on this, ” he said in a Facebook post.However, Loke did not say which logo would be used in GE15."
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",2:04 PM MYT,Asean+,,Singapore researchers develop blood test for cancer treatment and detection,"SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): Researchers in Singapore have developed a blood test which will not only allow doctors to determine the effectiveness of cancer treatment within 24 hours, but also detect the disease in annual check-ups.Targeted treatment for cancer, such as immunotherapy, blocks the abnormal growth of cancerous cells by attacking specific molecules which instruct them to grow and spread.But, to evaluate its effectiveness, clinicians often have to rely on imaging techniques such as MRI and CT scans, which are costly, and can only be determined weeks after the treatment, said Assistant Professor Shao Huilin from the National University of Singapore's Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Institute for Health Innovation and Technology (iHealthtech).Alternatively, a tissue biopsy, which is an invasive procedure, is carried out, she said.Prof Shao and her team have now developed ExoScope, which is able to accurately detect cancer drug effectiveness within a day through the use of a platform to identify extracellular vesicles which circulate in the blood.Extracellular vesicles are secreted by cancer cells and carry a variety of ""cargo"" inherited from their parent cells, including proteins, DNA, RNA and even drugs.When the cancer treatment is successful, it means that the targeted cancer drug has attached to the cancer cell and interfered with its tumour growth, and so the treated cell will release extracellular vesicles, containing the drug, into the bloodstream.This will be detected by ExoScope sensors which are able to to indicate drug effectiveness, said Zhang Yan, who is one of the authors of the study and a doctoral student from the NUS Department of Biomedical Engineering and iHealthtech.The research team collected information on different types of extracellular vesicles present before and after being treated with drugs from various targeted therapies.This enabled the platform to monitor the drug dynamics over time to accurately determine the effectiveness of the treatment and to look out for any signs of drug resistance.Prof Shao said that, in addition, the platform can be used to diagnose cancer early by detecting extracellular vesicles in the bloodstream.This could possibly be integrated into a routine blood test for yearly health check-ups, she told The Straits Times.The team conducted a clinical trial on 106 lung cancer patients who received targeted treatment to validate the effectiveness of the ExoScope platform.Compared to tumour imaging, which is currently deemed to be ""the gold standard"" for determining treatment effectiveness, the ExoScope achieved an accuracy rate of 95 per cent when conducted within 24 hours of treatment initiation.Describing the clinical trial results as ""encouraging"", Prof Shao said that the blood test can also be used for real-time treatment monitoring, and can lead to more timely treatment decisions.The team's research findings were published in the scientific journal Nature Nanotechnology on March 8.Dr Yvonne Ang, Associate Consultant at the Department of Haematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute, Singapore, said that a scan is usually done about eight weeks after lung cancer patients begin targeted therapy which blocks a protein known as the epidermal growth factor receptor. It is the most common treatment for such patients.""Through a simple blood test, this (ExoScope) technology would allow us to (determine) earlier which patients are more likely to have a good response to treatment. This has the potential to inform us on whether (the patient would need) additional or different therapies,"" said Dr Ang.Moving forward, the research team is looking to expand the use of the platform so that it can determine the efficacy of different drugs on a spectrum of diseases, including other cancers, as well as cardiovascular and neurological diseases.The team has also filed a patent for the technology and are hoping to bring it to market in the next three years. -The Straits Times/Asia News Network"

It has raised the international profile of its host country, contributing to local tourism gross domestic product (GDP) and attracting foreign direct investments (FDI)."

Khôi said the new method helped the firm increase sales.According to the report by Adsota, published every year since 2013 on the local digital market in Vietnam, as social distancing has forced people to minimise outdoor activities, customers have looked for alternative sources of entertainment and interaction online. Livestreaming has emerged as a popular form of entertainment because of its ability to transform content and high interactivity.It said 69 per cent of survey respondents said they watched more streaming content at home than they did before the pandemic.At the same time, in just half a month since the social distancing order, all livestream metrics on Facebook Gaming have increased significantly. In detail, total views increased 81.37 per cent reaching 119.7 million viewers, with the interaction and access ratios increasing by 79.6 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively.Data from 7Saturday's Report shows that up to 90 per cent of Vietnamese shoppers trust influencer reviews, while only 33 per cent trust advertisements from brands.The pandemic also had a great impact on the influencer community thanks to the diversity of fields and the ability to deliver ingenious content. Influencer marketing has become the choice of many industries, typically FMCG, technology, beauty and e-commerce while the variety of costs made them also suitable for lots of different sized businesses.The report estimated costs for influencers in Vietnam range from VNĐ500,000 and VNĐ1.5 million per post for less famous influencers, and up to VNĐ45 million to VNĐ100 million for the famous ones.The report also said the pandemic made consumers' price sensitivity no longer a leading factor in purchasing decisions, mentioning consumers tend to save more, but at the same time instead of choosing cheap products, they are interested in products with good quality and health benefits.It also found that items with strong spending included essential items, especially food, internet services, housing and utilities, and healthcare. Contrary to this upward trend, spending on beauty and entertainment products/services plummeted due to strict social distancing measures. — Vietnam News/Asia News Network"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",12:27 PM MYT,Asean+,,Ringgit shrugs off lockdown in sign worst of losses may be over,"KUALA LUMPUR (Bloomberg): The ringgit has greeted the start of Malaysia’s two-week national lockdown with a show of stability, suggesting any adverse impact from the restrictions may be limited.The currency was Asia’s worst-performer in May, falling almost 1% against the dollar as the nation’s virus cases rose to a record. However, it never breached the March low of just under 4.16 per dollar and steadied last week around 4.13 despite the start of the lockdown.Part of the reason is the impact of the recent tightening of restrictions on economic growth is estimated at less than 1%, according to the finance ministry. This is premised on a strategy that targets physical contact-heavy sectors while allowing those that contribute to more than 90% of GDP to operate.In fact, some suggest the curbs may actually benefit the currency if they widen Malaysia’s trade surplus by reducing demand for imports and exports remain robust. The latter surged 63% in April on an annual basis.""The lockdown could strengthen the ringgit due to domestic demand compression -- as we have seen previously in the case of the Philippine peso or Indian rupee, ” said Trang Thuy Le, Asia FX strategist at Macquarie Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong. The rupee was Asia’s best performing currency last month despite Covid-19 continuing to ravage India.The bigger near-term risk for the ringgit may be if the government’s $9.7 billion aid package spurs foreign investors to sell Malaysian bonds over fiscal deficit fears.But even here the impact of the stimulus may be limited. Economists at MIDF projected Malaysia’s fiscal deficit to be 6.1% of GDP, versus the official government forecast of 6%, after taking the package into account.""Fixed income outflows could rise in the near term on concern of fiscal deterioration, but we think this should be more than offset by weaker imports during lockdown, ” says Le, who sees the ringgit ending this month around 4.12 per dollar.Rising crude prices could also help support the ringgit given the country’s status as a net oil exporter. West Texas Intermediate touched its highest since October 2018 last week."

It was the fastest import growth since January 2011.China posted a trade surplus of $45.53 billion for the month, wider than the $42.86 billion surplus in April but less than the $50.5 billion expected by analysts.A brisk recovery in developed market demand and disruptions caused by COVID-19 in other manufacturing nations have strengthened China's exports, analysts said.However, exporters are grappling with higher raw material and freight costs, logistics bottlenecks and a strengthening yuan, which diminishes trade competitiveness.Prices for commodities such as coal, steel, iron ore and copper have surged this year, driven by easing pandemic lockdowns in many countries and ample global liquidity.The currency extended its rally in recent weeks to near three-year highs against the dollar, while its strength has yet to dent China's trade surplus, but could further saddle U.S. consumers with higher prices.The Biden administration is conducting a review of U.S.-China trade policy, ahead of the expiry of their Phase 1 deal at the end of 2021, which called for China to increase purchases of U.S. agricultural goods, manufactured products.Since President Joe Biden took office in January, China has increased engagement with U.S. trade and economic chiefs.

At least 849 have been killed, a rights group says. The army disputes that figure.Opponents of the junta have voiced frustration at the lack of tough action by Asean.Myanmar's crisis is also expected to be a topic at a special Asean-Chinese foreign ministers meeting in Chongqing this week.

South Korea’s exports, a bellwether for world trade, surged the most since 1988 in May, a sign that the global recovery is strengthening.""It’s still a fairly healthy set of numbers,” Jonathan Cavenagh, senior market strategist at Informa Global Markets, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV.""We know that global demand is still recovering and that trend is likely to continue towards the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter as the major developed economies open up.”A resurgence in Covid-19 cases in India and Southeast Asia has disrupted production in those countries, possibly driving more export orders to China. It’s also fuelled demand from those countries for Chinese-made medical goods, like personal protective equipment, according to economists at Citigroup Inc., writing ahead of the data.China’s exports will keep up their good momentum in the first half of the year, Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said last week.The ""trade surplus may still be wide in coming months as exports remain strong, ” said Peiqian Liu, an economist at Natwest Group Plc. ""We expect external sector out-performance to remain the key theme of recovery into the second half of 2021.”Higher commodity prices and last year’s low base continued to drive up imports. The economy’s strong recovery from the pandemic has fueled demand for commodities, also helping to boost their prices.Imports of iron ore and concentrate were up 85.5% by value in the first five months of the year, but only 6% by volume. Copper ore and concentrate imports were up 54.5% by value, but only 6.4% by volume.Those record prices are pushing up costs for businesses. The government has recently ratcheted up its campaign to tame prices and curb inflation pressures. The data may have also been distorted by fewer working days in May due to the five-day Labour Day holiday."

It is the second-largest firm in terms of testing revenue and the largest professional pure-play testing company worldwide, according to the company's website.Its major clients include MediaTek Inc, Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc, which has led to worries that it could exacerbate a global chip shortage that's hit industries from vehicles to electronics, if the outbreak worsens on the island.MediaTek said that it is in close communication with King Yuan, and the latter's production suspension is anticipated to have a temporary impact on its revenue in June. However, its growth goals for the second quarter and the whole year remain unchanged, according to media reports.Experts said that downstream companies in the mainland such as smartphone manufacturers - which account for a substantial portion of the island's chip exports - will also feel the impact if the epidemic on the island worsens.Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst, told the Global Times on Sunday that mainland companies may not feel the impact in the short term because chip delivery is being made in line with orders, but they will be affected in the medium term, especially given the global chip crunch.""If the epidemic on the whole island worsens and persists, it can't be ruled out that some Taiwan-based tech heavyweights may shift part of their production to the mainland, considering rising costs on the island due to COVID-19 prevention measures and possible shipment delays,"" Ma said.Experts said that it will be a trend for companies that previously moved their productions out of the mainland amid China-US trade tension, as well as companies initially established outside of the mainland, to pivot to the mainland market, given favourable conditions like a swift response to the epidemic and huge market demand.Liang Zhenpeng, a senior industry analyst, told the Global Times that some chip companies from the island of Taiwan have already set up branches in the mainland, and thus it will be easy for them to relocate part of the production. - Global Times"

Overtaking the EU, Asean jumped to become China's top trading partner in 2020.Chen said tourism is an important sector in cooperation between China and Asean countries.""Yet such cooperation has been frozen by the ravaging pandemic. So I believe how to resume normal people-to-people exchanges between those countries will be targeted by the upcoming meeting,"" Chen said.Wang Wenbin said a new-type sub-regional cooperation mechanism featuring extensive consultation between China, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam has developed rapidly and achieved remarkable results, promoting the economic and social development of the six riparian countries vigorously and brought tangible benefits to the people.Analysts said that as the world's economy has been threatened by both the pandemic and rising protectionism, the LMC has played important part in boosting regional economic stability and helping to weather US unilateralism.The time for discussion about a vaccine passport between China and Asean countries has come, although it will take time to happen, said Bi Shihong, professor at the Center for China's Neighbor Diplomacy Studies and School of International Studies, Yunnan University.He noted that currently, countries in the bloc have seen relatively low vaccination rates, and a vaccine passport can only be launched when both sides agree and have vaccination rates that are up to ""scientific standards.""Yet the relationship between China and certain Asean countries has encountered a bumpy road recently, with Beijing and Kuala Lumpur this week bickering about China's dispatching of 16 aircraft to the South China Sea for a routine flight, which Malaysia called ""intrusion.""Wang Wenbin on Wednesday refuted these accusations at a regular press conference, responding that the Chinese Air Force held a routine training operation in the southern Nansha Islands in the South China Sea.Wang said the training did not target any country, and the Chinese Air Force strictly abided by international law without entering the airspace of other countries.Experts brushed off the risk that such a small incident will undermine China's ties with Malaysia or countries from this bloc.""Regarding the South China Sea issue, Malaysia, and most Asean countries have maintained a smooth negotiation channel with China... and surely how to build up a better risk control mechanism will be discussed by officials from those countries,"" Chen said.Relevant countries see clearly that quarrels on South China Sea are not the biggest threat to regional stability; it is the US, whose warships frequently sail through the sensitive waters and try to force Asean countries to take sides to confront China, observers noted.Asean countries did not dance to the US' tune on many sensitive issues, despite Washington's frequent calls on the bloc to disrupt China's neighbouring diplomacy, said Bi, noting that those countries know that US promises are just ""empty checks.""""Take the Covid-19 assistance as an example, the US provides neither anti-pandemic materials nor vaccines for Asean countries, which keeps their eyes open to the US' real intentions,"" Bi said. - Global Times"

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",9:54 AM MYT,Asean+,,Should Singapore offer lottery draws to boost Covid-19 vaccination rate?,"SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): Cows, scholarships and million-dollar lottery draws - governments around the world have dangled these and other incentives in front of their citizens to help them overcome vaccine hesitancy and give national Covid-19 vaccination drives a booster shot.While Singapore has been making steady progress on the vaccination front, some observers have asked whether offering people additional incentives could help accelerate its pace.At least one organisation here has embarked on a campaign to offer benefits to Singapore residents who have been vaccinated.The Minmed Group, which runs four Covid-19 vaccine centres here, has launched an online platform - iamvaccinated.sg - where local businesses can offer discounts and promotions to those who have received their shots.While some observers believe incentives could nudge those who are still hesitant, others said implementing such a scheme now could be seen as rewarding late adopters and that it could diminish the intrinsic motivation to get the jab out of a sense of social responsibility.The Singapore Government has so far relied mostly on providing up-to-date and accurate information on the vaccine to convince Singaporeans to take the jab.Leaders here have also urged citizens to go for the shot. Last Monday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in his national address, made a direct appeal to 280,000 seniors who have yet to book a slot to do so.But other countries have not stopped at educational and information campaigns to convince their citizens to get vaccinated.In the US state of Ohio, for instance, the state government is incentivising Americans to get vaccinated with cash prizes from a Vax-A-Million lottery totalling US$5 million (S$6.6 million) and another US$600,000 going to scholarships for vaccinated teens.The idea of providing incentives, including lottery draws, has gained traction among some here, including Associate Professor Jeremy Lim from the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.Noting that Singapore is grappling with its most severe challenge since independence, he said offering incentives would allow the Government to make the vaccine benefits tangible, short of mandating the shots.Prof Lim added that such incentives are complementary to robust public health education and engagement.Albert Winsemius Chair Professor of Economics Euston Quah of Nanyang Technological University said an economic argument can be made to provide incentives for vaccination, as people who have been vaccinated reduce medical and health costs for society.""The more people are vaccinated, the greater the likelihood that the pandemic will end. Thus, this group of vaccinated people confers a positive external effect on society compared with people who do not get vaccinated,"" he said.""(Such incentives) reduce a possible market failure in not leaving such important public health implications and costs to individual decisions per se.""Other observers, such as Associate Professor Lim Poh Lian, director of the High Level Isolation Unit at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, were more cautious about the signals that incentives could send.She noted that there are currently more than 40 active Covid-19 clusters in Singapore and that cases have been recorded in malls, tuition centres and public housing.""So, the urgent need to get vaccinated has become quite obvious to most people,"" she said.Prof Lim added that financial incentives, as an extrinsic motivator, tend to weaken intrinsic motivation.""When those who got vaccinated out of a sense of duty (intrinsic motivation) see other people getting cash in order to get vaccinated, they get cynical. The next time you call on them to do something out of duty, they may well ask, 'How much are you going to pay me?'""NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser said that while cash would likely help nudge people into doing what they might be reluctant to do, it could also establish an unhealthy expectation.Yio Chu Kang MP Yip Hon Weng added that offering an incentive for vaccination might send a signal that the vaccines are somehow undesirable or unsafe, hence needing incentives to encourage uptake.Instead of incentives, he suggested that the Government consider bundling health check-ups with vaccination appointments, or offering the remaining unvaccinated members of the household to be vaccinated together, so that household transmission could be further reduced.But NUS' Prof Jeremy Lim said concerns about unhappy precedents being set and the public expecting future incentives are unwarranted.""We are in a crisis situation and we should be bold, doing whatever it takes to get us to the required population vaccination numbers,"" he said.Sembawang GRC MP Mariam Jaafar said that while incentives can provide a ""short-term boost"" to the vaccination rate, multiple strategies including subsidising some alternative vaccines and tailoring communication to specific needs are needed.A retired tuition teacher, who wanted to be known only as Chia, disagreed with handing out cash vouchers or lottery tickets to encourage vaccinations.The 68-year-old had hesitated taking the jab due to concerns about its safety. She decided to get it only in late April after being repeatedly urged by her children.""I will be very disappointed with the Government if it takes such an approach. The decision to take the vaccine is a serious matter, and we should be educating the public properly about it instead of treating it like some kind of game,"" said Mrs Chia.Ohio is offering lottery draw chances for those who get inoculated against Covid-19, and some other American states have followed suit.California is offering US$100 million (S$132 million) in US$50 prepaid cards for the next two million newly vaccinated people and US$16.5 million in cash prizes for all vaccinated Californians.In Oregon and Colorado, those who have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine by a prescribed date are automatically entered into lottery draws where they can win up to US$1 million.The Hong Kong authorities have also dangled a vaccine lottery featuring a new flat worth HK$10.8 million (S$1.84 million), which has reportedly led to a surge in vaccine bookings since the lottery was announced on May 28.Not to be outdone, the mayor of a farming town near Manila has promised to raffle a cow each month from September to get his constituents to take vaccine shots from Russia or China.Here in Singapore, the Minmed Group recently launched an initiative where residents can enjoy special privileges such as discounts and cash vouchers from merchants by showing their HealthHub vaccination record.The initiative is supported by public healthcare technology agency Integrated Health Information Systems.At least 40 merchants have joined the initiative so far.Inez Lim, the founder of Kittea, a tea retailer which is a participating merchant under this scheme, believes life could start going back to a new normal when a significant proportion of the population has been vaccinated.""Everyone loves a good discount, and if enough brands come on board, the pull factor can be appealing enough to overcome any minor fears people may have about getting their jabs,"" she said. -The Straits Times/Asia News Network"

And we also have significant compliance work under way on the casino sector,"" Rose wrote.AUSTRAC later confirmed the investigations - plus a separate investigation of No. 3 lender National Australia Bank Ltd - without commenting further.All three casino companies said AUSTRAC was concerned with their management of ""customers identified as high risk and politically exposed persons"", that the agency had not decided whether to take enforcement action, and that they would cooperate fully.The crackdown may meanwhile complicate a A$9 billion buyout by Star of larger rival Crown, which has been fielding takeover approaches.""If it's found to be a systematic and ongoing lackadaisical attitude to enforcement then (a regulator objection) seems likely,"" said Nathan Bell, portfolio manager of Intelligent Investor, which has Crown shares.""If Star is seen to have good standards and there is a genuine effort to weed out these people then... the regulators would rather Crown was kept in Australian hands and Star's takeover proposal would remain live.""Angus Hewitt, an analyst at Morningstar, said the widening of the investigation was ""obviously not good news for the embattled casinos, and we expect fines to be the most likely outcome"".Crown shares were down 1.5% in a flat overall market and Star shares were down 3%. SkyCity's New Zealand-listed shares did not trade because of a public holiday.In a separate development, Crown said it had received legal advice that it had contravened casino laws by selling over A$160 million of gambling chips to people paying with credit or debit cards from 2012 to 2016 - potentially sparking yet another investigation.($1 = 1.2933 Australian dollars) - Reuters"

It also fulfils residents’ demand to buy basic items without having to be in crowds, to reduce risks of Covid-19 transmission, ” he said when met at Dengkil PST.According to Zainal, due to a 30 per cent drop in income compared to during MCO 1.0, as more premises are opened this time, he tries other methods of selling namely via online and cash on delivery (COD) service.For dragon fruit seller, Leo Chen Lun, 38, the PST’s concept not only gives business opportunities to farmers and SME traders but also provide a safe and convenient method for consumers to shop.""The place is open and spacious and there is also a drive-thru service for customers who buy online. It is just that this time around sales are quite slow, maybe because, during this MCO 3.0, many shops and supermarkets are opened.

We believe that 95% of undocumented migrants in Malaysia are in this position because of violations by agents, employers and human traffickers.“We understand the government’s concern to get everyone vaccinated, but detaining undocumented workers isn’t the right approach, ” it added.The NGOs and individuals also invited the authorities to a dialogue to look at ""progressive ways in which we can work together to resolve issues surrounding undocumented migrant workers."""

I will feel more confident after my second dose on Aug 31, ” he told reporters Monday (June 7).Samsuddin, who is from Sungai Nibong, hoped that more people would register for the vaccination to help save the country’s healthcare system.""My daughter is a nurse in Johor Baru and she always tells us how hard the medical frontliners are working to handle Covid-19 cases, on top of wearing the multiple layers of personal protective equipment.""It is disappointing to see that there are still those who believe that Covid-19 is a propaganda.

We feel so relieved after receiving our jabs on June 1 recently, ” she said.She said they were both willing to drive all the way from Penang to Kuala Lumpur just to get themselves vaccinated.Nazariah said that the sentiment is shared by several others as people are keen on getting protected against Covid-19, as proven by the fast take-up of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was once clouded by controversies due to its possible side effects.""I do not mind getting whichever vaccine as long as it is approved by the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA). I only experienced a slight fever and sore arm after 24 hours of taking the vaccine, which subsided after I took panadol every six hours, ” said the mother of two. - Bernama"

In January, Russia announced its own plans to leave the treaty, and the government submitted legislation to parliament last month to formalise its departure.Russian officials said they regretted the U.S. decision not to rejoin, calling it a ""political mistake"" and warned the move would not create an atmosphere conducive to arms control discussions at a the Geneva summit later this month.(Reporting by Anton Kolodyazhnyy; Writing by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Andrew Osborn)"

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for July touched $70 for the first time since October 2018 but reversed course to be at $69.10 a barrel, down 52 cents, or 0.8%.Investors may have sold off some contracts to take profit when WTI hit $70, said Avtar Sandu, a senior commodities manager at Phillips Futures in Singapore.""The primary concern is about Iranian barrels coming back into the market but I don't think there will be a deal before the Iranian presidential election,"" he added.Data showing a 14.6% year-on-year drop in China's crude oil imports in May on Monday also weighed on prices.However, Brent and WTI have risen for the past two weeks as fuel demand is rebounding in the United States and Europe after governments loosened COVID-19 restrictions ahead of summer travel.Global oil demand is expected to exceed supplies in the second half despite a gradual easing of supply cuts by OPEC+ producers, analysts say.A slowdown in talks between Iran and global powers in reviving a 2015 nuclear deal and a drop in U.S. rig count also supported oil prices.Iran and global powers will enter a fifth round of talks on June 10 in Vienna that could include Washington lifting economic sanctions on Iranian oil exports.While the European Union envoy coordinating the negotiations had said he believed a deal would be struck at this week's talks, other senior diplomats have said the most difficult decisions still lie ahead.Analysts expect Iran, which is having its presidential election on June 18, to increase its production by 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day once sanctions are lifted.In the United States, the number of oil and natural gas rigs operating fell for the first time in six weeks as growth in drilling slowed.This ""suggests that U.S. oil drillers are less enthusiastic in adding more U.S. oil production and hence reduces the risk of a supply glut in the global oil market in H2 2021,"" CMC Markets analyst Kelvin Wong said in emailed comments. - Reuters"

We do not want to be ill with Covid-19. Each individual must take responsibility to stop the transmission of the virus in their family members and communities, ” she said.WHO representative to Cambodia Li Ailan echoed Vandine’s concerns, saying the situation remained serious.“Complacency is very dangerous! New infections are likely to be increasing... It is not the right time to relax #COVID19 measures. Let’s focus on ensuring the effectiveness of our interventions! To do so, everyone plays a vital role, ” she tweeted on June 5.On June 4, the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge detected the B.1.617 variant through genome sequencing tests in the three workers who arrived through the O’Smach international border checkpoint in Oddar Meanchey province.One of the workers is being treated in Oddar Meanchey province while the other two are undergoing treatment in Battambang province.Minister of Health Mam Bun Heng said the B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV-2 – the pathogen that causes Covid-19 – has been detected in seven Southeast Asian countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.Bun Heng said the authorities need to be on the lookout for other suspicious cases of the highly infectious coronavirus variant first identified in India, tracking those who have been near the three infected individuals.He advised that all health departments remain vigilant and correctly implement the standard operating procedures used to prevent person-to-person transmission, including the isolation of patients and making serious efforts at contact tracing in locations where Covid-19 cases were detected.Cambodia detected its first case of the B.1.617 variant on May 11, in a passenger on an incoming flight who had already recovered from Covid-19.Nguon Ratanak, the governor of Battambang province that borders Thailand, said at a Covid-19 prevention commission meeting on June 5 that recently the number of returning workers from Thailand and transiting workers from other provinces had increased.“In early May, nearly 1,000 people stayed at 12 quarantine centres in the province. But so far in June the number has risen to more than 2,200. This increased number includes returning workers from Thailand, ” he said.He added that the rate of infections among workers from Thailand had increased compared to earlier this year. For every 100 workers, previously only one or two had tested positive for Covid-19. But now there are many positive cases.“In my observation and that of other officials, when a worker tests positive for the virus, Thailand sends him or her back to Cambodia. Our medical personnel have observed that the workers hold certificates from Thailand saying they are negative for the virus but when we check them they test positive.“The reason why we are sceptical is that the Thai government wants Cambodians to return home. Another point is that in Thailand, when people test positive they have to pay money for treatment. Cambodian workers might know that they are positive for Covid-19 but they return home because our government treats them free of charge, ” he said.Regarding Cambodia’s ongoing outbreak, Ratanak said people working in other provinces had returned home in large numbers and they brought Covid-19 along with them.As of June 5, Battambang had recorded 352 Covid-19 cases, 50 per cent of which involved workers from abroad and the rest linked to the ongoing community outbreak.

Afterwards, the two released a joint statement that included concerns about Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea and security in the Indo-Pacific.In April, New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta raised eyebrows when she said that New Zealand was “uncomfortable” with expanding the remit of the Five Eyes, stressing that it was “a security and intelligence framework” and not necessarily the “first port of call” to create a coalition of support, particularly on human rights issues.When Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne visited Wellington late last month, she described the bloc as a “vital strategic alliance that is key, particularly to our security and intelligence interests”.Analysts say New Zealand’s quieter diplomatic approach – in contrast to Australia leading calls for an inquiry into the origin of Covid-19 and the US’ trade war with China and resistance of Chinese influence – shows a divergence in views on the purpose of the Five Eyes, but also a desire not to damage relations with its largest trading partner as the other members have.A new course?Alexander Gillespie, a law professor at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, said there were multiple considerations for the country, including its efforts to “find a middle ground” where it would not necessarily become entangled in others’ views.“New Zealand has a strong tradition of independence in foreign policy and could be trying to cut a new course,” he said. “New Zealand is [also] scared that what has happened to Australia, in terms of trade disputes, could easily happen to New Zealand if it spoke out with the same voice.”Trade between China and New Zealand reached more than NZ$31 billion (US$22.4 billion) last year, with dairy the top export to China and electric machinery and equipment the largest import. The two countries also moved to eliminate nearly all trade tariffs between them after upgrading their bilateral free-trade agreement in late January.By contrast, Beijing has imposed damaging trade restrictions on a slew of Australian products following Canberra’s calls for the Covid-19 origin inquiry, and the two exchanged fiery words in December when their free-trade pact was due for a five-year review.Hongzhi Gao, a senior research fellow at the New Zealand Contemporary China Research Centre, said while New Zealand had a strong economic relationship with China, businesses were trying to diversify to reduce reliance on China, in part due to the political risks.“From the trade point of view, New Zealand is still a small trading country,” he said. “Things are getting really politicised and very intense and the fight between the US and China is very clear ... New Zealand companies are very, very concerned about what’s happening between the US and China and also what’s happening between Australia and China.”In April, Ardern said the Five Eyes remained New Zealand’s “most important security and intelligence partnership” but that it also had an independent foreign policy. She said the country was looking to diversify its trading relations from China, and while voicing concerns on global issues should be done collectively, some of it “may not belong to that Five Eyes partnership”.New Zealand wants to be independent, so using [Ardern’s] terms, New Zealand wants to swim in its own laneHongzhi Gao, New Zealand Contemporary China Research CentreGao, who also advises New Zealand companies about the political risks of operating in China, said the country had sought out a more independent approach when it came to China.“New Zealand wants to be independent, so using [Ardern’s] terms, New Zealand wants to swim in its own lane,” he said.Indeed over the past year, as the Five Eyes widened the scope of their cooperation in the face of what has been seen as a growing security threat from China, New Zealand has taken a more independent path.Last July, following similar action by other members, New Zealand suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong over concerns about a national security law imposed on the city by Beijing. But while Wellington added its voice to Five Eyes joint statements of concern on Hong Kong in August and November, it did not sign joint statements on the city last May or this January, instead issuing its own expressions of concern.On technology, New Zealand has barred its national telecoms company Spark from using Huawei Technologies in 5G networks on national security concerns, but has not followed Britain, the US and Australia in a complete ban on Huawei equipment.New Zealand seeks rich investors, high-skilled labour in immigration resetRobert Ayson, a professor of strategic studies at Victoria University of Wellington, said New Zealand’s position was that it would sometimes prefer to use other groupings to express its concerns and would sometimes join the other Five Eyes countries.“That is also what the actual record of New Zealand governments suggests, including in the time since Mahuta became foreign affairs minister,” he said. “And you will notice that both Ardern and Mahuta have been reaffirming the importance of the Five Eyes grouping to New Zealand.”He said one reason for New Zealand’s approach was its preference for speaking with wider and more inclusive groups for as much multilateral consensus as possible, although he noted exceptions such as Wellington not joining a statement from 14 countries raising concerns with the World Health Organization report on the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.“I also think there are questions about how much the New Zealand government wants people to think that its views on human rights issues – and on some other international issues – are shaped by its traditional security relationships,” he said.But analysts say Wellington will come under more pressure as the strategic rivalry between Beijing and Washington in particular deepens. There have also been tensions between China and New Zealand in recent years, including controversies over Chinese influence in New Zealand’s domestic politics. And after Wellington barred Huawei equipment from its new 5G network in 2018, Ardern’s official visit to Beijing was postponed and the launch of a Chinese tourism campaign to New Zealand was delayed.We make our decisions independently, informed by our values and our own assessment of New Zealand’s interestsForeign Minister Nanaia MahutaIt is also not the first time that New Zealand has been caught between major powers – Wellington angered Washington when it made the country a nuclear-free zone during the Cold War following domestic concerns about nuclear-powered US ships at New Zealand’s ports. As a result, the US downgraded its diplomatic relationship with New Zealand, and New Zealand was suspended from the ANZUS military treaty.Economic interestsYu Lei, chief research fellow at Liaocheng University’s Research Centre for Pacific Island Countries in China’s Shandong province, said New Zealand had taken a different stance to the other Five Eyes nations in part because it was more focused on protecting its economic interests as a smaller country.“It also has serious competition for its exports,” he said. “New Zealand’s export products and markets are similar to those of the US, Australia and Canada, particularly its agricultural and livestock products ... New Zealand attaches great importance to its existing markets and is not willing to sacrifice its own interests because of US hegemony, and cannot afford to sacrifice them.”In mid-April, Mahuta said China and New Zealand needed to respect each other even as there were things that the two countries “do not, cannot and will not agree” upon, and that New Zealand had on many occasions raised issues with China privately.“Sometimes we will therefore find it necessary to speak out publicly on issues, like we have on developments in Hong Kong, the treatment of Uygurs in Xinjiang and cyber incidents,” she said. “At times we will do this in association with others that share our views and sometimes we will act alone. In each case we make our decisions independently, informed by our values and our own assessment of New Zealand’s interests.”What is going on in Xinjiang and who are the Uygur Muslims?The country’s parliament unanimously declared in May that “severe human rights abuses” were taking place against ethnic Uygurs in China’s Xinjiang region, but stopped short of calling Beijing’s repression there “genocide” as the parliaments in Canada, Britain and the US have.Jim Rolfe, a former government adviser who is now a senior research fellow at Victoria University, said New Zealand, along with Southeast Asian nations, preferred “quiet, or traditional, diplomacy to megaphone diplomacy”.“New Zealand has made some public statements, one at least with the other countries,” he said. “New Zealand’s statements tend to make the same points, but in slightly different language. The aim is to be listened to rather than dismissed for grandstanding.”More from South China Morning Post:New Zealand’s bid to find middle ground between Western allies and China not lost on Beijing: expertsNew Zealand to stay true to values even amid growing differences with China, Ardern saysNew Zealand ‘uncomfortable’ with growing scope of Five Eyes as members speak out on ChinaFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021."

So far, 2.8 million people deemed most vulnerable, including frontline health and transport workers, have received a first dose.But the government has come under fire from opposition politicians who accuse it of complacency and an over-reliance on the locally-made AstraZeneca doses.Thailand had escaped the worst of the pandemic as it hit other countries hard last year, but is now grappling with its deadliest outbreak. The third wave has accounted for more than 80% of total infections so far. Officials reported 2,419 new COVID-19 cases and 33 deaths on Monday, bringing the total to 179,886 and 1,269 fatalities.""My feeling is that no matter what, we will need to go outside of home for the littlest things, so getting the vaccine gives us a sense of relief,"" said Praepawee Lertpongkijja, 38, at a Bangkok vaccination centre.The government has been scrambling to source more vaccines as concerns emerged about the production capacity of royal-owned Siam Bioscience, the Thai company making the AstraZeneca vaccine locally, after the Philippines said its order had been reduced and delayed.Thailand will receive an additional 3.24 million doses from AstraZeneca after mid-June, the health ministry said in a statement, but did not specify how much would be locally made.The Thai government received 1.8 million locally-produced AstraZeneca shots on Friday and has sourced another 200,000 doses from South Korea, a health ministry source told Reuters. Thailand expects to sign a contract this week for 20 million shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.(Reporting by Juarawee Kittisilpa, Chayut Setboonsarng and Panarat Thepgumpanat, writing by Kay Johnson; Editing by Jane Wardell)"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",2:57 PM MYT,Asean+,IRIS PANG,Analysis: China’s May exports slow but imports jump. Why?,"BEIJING, June 7: China's trade growth showed slower exports but faster imports. What's behind this divergence?Exports in May 2021 grew 27.9%YoY, which is slower than the consensus expectation of 32% growth.The main reason for the shortfall is that all export items related to semiconductor chips have slowed.Auto processing products and parts, the biggest export item, fell 4%YoY in terms of export value. This is most likely the result of the semiconductor chip shortage.In contrast, imports grew 45.53%YoY in May. This was largely the effect of higher commodity prices from last year as import volumes actually decreased on a monthly basis.In addition, port disruption added pressure to trade.Since the end of May, there have been around 10 Covid cases daily in Guangdong, where most electronics factories are located.Shipments from the port in Shenzhen that process most of the electronic throughput have been affected by Covid. Port workers now have to have Covid tests and port operations have been disrupted.Some factories in Guangdong were also affected by Covid, mostly caused by workers queuing up for testing.As such we expect June trade and production data will be affected.This could push up prices of electronic goods in general and affect China's export prices and eventually import prices in the US and Europe.And supply chains in Asia will also likely be disrupted.(Iris Pang is ING's chief economist, Greater China)"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Cathay aircrew may have to be vaccinated to keep their jobs, airline saysChris Kempis, the airline’s director of flight operations, told staff: “As we look to the future it is critically important that we keep our crew resource levels right, plan appropriately for the recovery and future growth to our network, and look forward to increasing demand as we welcome back more of our customers.”In recent months, the airline has signalled it will cut back on pilot numbers by reducing the number of cockpit crew hired outside Hong Kong.On Tuesday evening, the company informed 125 Australia-based pilots it would stop employing cockpit crew in that country. While eligible pilots with the right to work in Hong Kong can choose to transfer, all other staff will be made redundant.Pilots employed by the airline in Canada and Germany have been told over the past two months that they would lose their jobs, affecting about 130 people. The fate of more than 250 pilots hired in Britain, the United States and New Zealand, meanwhile, remains under review.More recently, it offered voluntary redundancy to local crews. The airline is also embroiled in a tussle with the Immigration Department over employing foreign pilots who require a work visa.About two weeks ago, the airline warned pilots they could be at risk of losing their jobs if they did not get vaccinated. The new job advert specifies that applicants must provide a Covid-19 vaccine certificate.The airline employs around 3,150 pilots worldwide and 2,600 in Hong Kong as of last month, before headcount reductions.The company cut 5,900 jobs last year and closed Cathay Dragon, resulting in hundreds of locally trained pilots being unemployed, which prompted authorities to scrutinise the airline and the wider industry’s practice of hiring foreign labour at the expense of unemployed locals.Lack of lift: how protests and Covid hit Cathay Pacific hardA company spokeswoman said the airline did not have a set number of pilots it would hire. “Reviewing our crewing requirements is an ongoing process.”Citing the lengthy lead time to procure new pilots, the company said: “We have determined that now is the time to recommence our recruitment and training activities.”Kempis signalled in his staff message that the worst times for the airline’s passenger flight operations now appeared to be behind it.“Recruitment at this stage is about forward planning and as we move through the summer, we are already seeing small, but definite growth in our passenger schedules,” he added.In 2019, Cathay hired 350 pilots and the following year employed 90 more before the coronavirus crisis took hold early in 2020.A survey by a Cathay Dragon pilots concern group conducted last month showed there were 183 unemployed pilots in Hong Kong.Some 175 of those were permanent residents, which includes people born and raised in Hong Kong as well as those who acquired the status after living and working in the city for at least seven years.“We hope that these are genuine employment opportunities with remuneration packages commensurate with experience levels, and not just a gesture to support work visa renewals in a city with hundreds of unemployed local pilots,” a concern group spokesman said.The government led a HK$39 billion bailout of Cathay Pacific last summer, helping the airline raise about two-thirds of the total.The city administration also placed two observers on the company board for the first time, allowing authorities to keep a closer eye on the airline’s affairs.A handful of other airlines have started rehiring, including in the United States where recruitment is being fuelled by the rapid rebound in domestic travel. Middle East carrier Qatar Airways has started a similar process, albeit with smaller numbers involved.How Hong Kong’s former cabin crew members are taking off in new jobsHowever, Cathay’s precarious financial position, combined with the lack of a substantive recovery and a surplus of pilots already on its ranks, differentiates the carrier from other firms now hiring.The airline made a HK$21.6 billion loss in 2020, and is expected to be make heavy losses throughout this year.To tackle the surplus among its 1,000 locally employed Boeing 777 pilots, it is moving crews on to the short-haul Airbus A321neo. Each month around 16 employees who pilot the 777 are being retrained on the 747.More from South China Morning Post:Cathay Pacific aircrew may have to get coronavirus vaccine if they want to keep their jobs, carrier saysJet-setting dreams grounded by Covid-19 pandemic, but Hong Kong flight attendants take off in new jobs, thanks to ‘priceless soft skills’For the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021."

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Business,,Call for compassion from IAA Malaysia,"PETALING JAYA: International Advertising Association Malaysia (IAA Malaysia), in taking the credo of IAA as the global compass for the marketing and communications industry, has embarked on the research on the ills that ail the work-from-home (WFH) population.To say that the Covid-19 pandemic has turned the world on its head, is putting it rather mildly.In many countries, and Malaysia is one, the light at the end of the tunnel seems to get further by the day, causing despair to many and pushing people to wish and pray for a turnaround in the landscape.There is almost no sector in any industry that remains unscathed from the prescribed WFH syndrome.As WFH emerged more of a norm as time went on, people found their work life and lifestyle disrupted in ways they had never imagined. In Malaysia and across the world, WFH took its toll.Three major pain points were identified by IAA Malaysia, in unintended and prolonged WFH, that apply to all industries.One, a trigger on mental health, with most having no idea on what constitutes mental health.Two, a habit of and an expectation of working beyond the standard nine to five or eight hours.Three, a dent on relationships, whether between partners, spouses, siblings, parents and children, even entire families, all from space and time encroachment.Led by IAA Malaysia honorary secretary, Prabha Nayar, a strategist and creative director, a public service campaign was conceptualised and developed.Nayar said: “With the pandemic playing on people’s minds, IAA Malaysia took the thought process deeper, further and focussed on the WFH syndrome. The end line, ‘A call to all to make compassion a way of work’ cannot be more apt”.The creative campaign can be used in various mediums.“In early May, IAA India had rolled out the ‘The World Needs A Breather’ campaign.“It gained extensive editorial attention and social media traction.“Numerous IAA chapters worldwide, adapted the campaign”, said John Chacko, President of IAA Malaysia."
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Business,,Store operators cater to pandemic-driven demand,"TOKYO: Major convenience store operators have rolled out new products and services amid the prolonged pandemic hoping to cater to customers’ changing needs as they stay home more.FamilyMart Co began selling T-shirts, underwear and the like under the brand “Convenience Wear” at its stores across the nation in March.Conventionally, the main customers purchasing underclothes at convenience stores have been business travellers and those on vacation.However, the company launched the new brand with a special focus on comfort to address demand for such wear as people spend longer time at home.The products are also being promoted as ecologically friendly as they use fibers made from old clothes and fabric scraps.In March, the company started a “bottle keep” service for bottled drinks. Customers who use the service can buy in advance 24 bottles of water or tea in 600 ml plastic bottles via the company’s smartphone app and then pick them up whenever they want at any store across the nation.The service is offered at the discounted price — it costs 1,900 yen (RM71.62) when it normally should cost 2,400 yen (RM90.47), with tax. As a bottled tea or water is 100 yen (RM3.77) each, customers get 24 bottles for the money worth 19 bottles.FamilyMart hope the service will provide more opportunities for customers to stop by stores in office districts, where customer traffic is declining, and encourage them to buy other products as well.In late March, Lawson, Inc released “stick onigiri, ” a handheld rice food similar to norimaki rice rolls.Its unconventional shape allows consumers to taste the filling from the first bite.People can also eat it without getting their hands dirty as it can be eaten while still wrapped in the package.To meet demand for takeout, the company is also expanding food items cooked at its stores, with plans to increase stores offering freshly prepared boxed meals from 6,400 as of the end of February to 10,000 by fiscal 2022.Seven-Eleven Japan Co, the largest convenience store chain in the nation, is now focusing on meal kits such as cut vegetables so consumers can easily prepare food at home.The food products are available to registered customers and can be purchased by placing an order online, then picking them up at a store or have them delivered home.Many convenience store sales in April almost recovered to pre-pandemic levels on a same-store basis.In addition to so-called social-distancing fatigue from staying home, strong sales of alcoholic beverages and long-life frozen foods are providing a tailwind.“Developing products that will motivate customers to visit stores will be increasingly important as consumption behaviors are changing, ” said Yutaka Suzuki, a senior researcher at the Distribution Economics Institute of Japan. — The Japan News/ANN"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Business,,AMC drama exposes risks in index world,"NEW YORK: Index funds are supposed to cut out the human-driven craziness that periodically infects markets, but the recent meme-stock fever proved the US$11 trillion (RM45.41 trillion) industry is far from immune.The remarkable surge in shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc and a handful of other stocks is showing up in multiple exchange-traded funds, skewing portfolios, altering risk profiles and exerting outsized influence on prices.Take the US$68bil (RM280.7bil) iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ticker IWM).In the past week through Thursday, AMC powered 70% of the product’s advance. The stock was responsible for less than a 10th of the fund’s return in the previous week.It’s a timely reminder that even diversified funds on autopilot remain subject to the whims and eccentricities that frequently lash markets out of nowhere.“For index investing, the appeal is that human decision-making, human emotions are taken out of it, ” said Tom Essaye, a former Merrill Lynch trader who founded “the Sevens Report” newsletter.“That works all well and good until a stock that is supposed to be 50 basis points of the fund now becomes 6%.”The AMC effect can be seen across a range of funds. Alongside IWM, the US$17.5bil (RM72.24bil) iShares Russell 2000 Value ETF (IWN) and US$72bil (RM297.22bil) iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR) have also seen the stock’s influence climb.A similar phenomenon took place in January, when GameStop Corp at one point surged more than 1,600%.Shares of the video-game retailer also rallied alongside AMC in the past week. The two companies are among a handful of shares dubbed meme stocks that are enjoying rapid, social-media fueled gains.“Once the rules have been drawn up in the land of indexing, once the play has been called in the huddle, you don’t have that discretion, ” said Ben Johnson, Morningstar’s global director of ETF research. “You take whatever the market is going to give you and execute the plays.”The difference now is that investors have poured billions of dollars into products tracking smaller and cheaper stocks in the past six months, part of a broad rotation into more growth-sensitive companies to ride an economic recovery from Covid-19.At the same time, meme mania is bigger than ever. Alongside AMC and GameStop, companies including BlackBerry Ltd, Koss Corp and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc also saw huge moves in the past week.“Even in a basket of 2,000 stocks you’re getting some systemic risk around this concept of retail meme stocks because they’re small enough to push around, ” said Nick Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.The cash and chaos exposes a glitch in the plumbing of many funds, which is that they’re often tied to the rebalancing schedule of the index they follow.Given the speed of the rallies in the likes of AMC and GameStop, even tracking an index that rebalances quarterly - a relatively frequent schedule, by industry standardsOne of the most-dramatic examples occurred in May, though it was unrelated to the meme-fueled drama.Around 68% of the US$14.5bil (RM59.86bil) iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) had to be changed because of the huge market rotation that occurred since its last semiannual rebalance.For quants who like to slice and dice stocks by characteristics like how expensive they appear or how much their prices swing around - known as factors -- it’s all known as style drift. The fund is drifting away from its strategy, or investing style.Not too long ago, AMC shares looked cheap and beaten down, meaning it qualified for many value factor strategies. But the wild surge of recent weeks makes it among the most-expensive stocks in the Russell 3000.AMC shares currently stand at almost 10 times the level analysts see it trading a year from now: $5.25 (RM21.67).The premium tops all Russell 3000 stocks that have enough of an analyst following to generate a price target, according to Bloomberg data, and more than double that of GameStop -- the next over-valued stock.AMC will likely remain in many value funds until their rebalancing comes around.“Research tells premiums such as those associated with small cap and value stocks are generally delivered by a subset of the asset class, ” said Wes Crill at Dimensional Fund Advisors, a pioneer of quant investing which has US$637bil (RM2.62 trillion) under management. “Style drift can reduce the odds of capturing the premiums when they appear.”The obvious solution would be to rebalance more often. But that would bring more transactional costs to funds, which can be a big problem for passive vehicles charging rock-bottom fees. — Bloomberg"

Although I love the clay, I was, like, if I could just win a match. That's kind of where I was kind of coming in.""FEARLESS RYBAKINAThe 39-year-old Williams never really found her range but she recovered from an early service break in the opening set.However, a fearless Rybakina, who hit 21 winners to the 15 of Williams throughout the contest, responded superbly to break again and pocket the opener in confident fashion.The calm-headed and clean-hitting Rybakina, seeded 21, broke the Williams serve at 3-3 in the second set but immediately dropped her own as she betrayed the first sign of nerves.It was Williams, contesting the round of 16 at a Slam for the 64th time, who faltered though. She looked hesitant and sluggish and dropped her serve to love in the next game.Rybakina, who was born in Moscow but represents Kazakhstan, then calmly served out for the biggest win of her career as Williams belted a backhand long after one hour 17 minutes.Her reaction was subdued, and she later explained her mindset going into the match.""I follow the plan which we have. If it works well, I'm winning, and if it's not, I'm just learning from the matches. It's all like experience for me,"" she said.As Williams walked off Court Philippe Chatrier she stooped to pick up some clay dust -- a hint perhaps that she feels time is running out to add to her three French Open titles.She will, however, arrive at Wimbledon as one of the favourites as she tries to match Margaret Court's 24 Grand Slam singles titles.

Some 48% said the event would be cancelled.But most of the respondents in the same poll said virus measures for athletes and participants were inadequate, while public support for the Suga administration hit its lowest level, at 37%.Foreign spectators are already prohibited from the Olympics and Japanese may also be kept away from what organisers promise will be a sanitised ""bubble"" event to minimise contagion risk.HEALTH MORE IMPORTANT THAN EXCITEMENTLocal authorities have scaled down Olympic torch relay events and host towns for Olympic athletes changed their minds.Saitama prefecture decided to cancel its plan to install two public viewing sites, Saitama governor Motohiro Ono said on Monday. Ono said prevention of infection was more important than excitement.Japanese Olympic Committee board member Kaori Yamaguchi, a judo bronze medallist at the 1988 Seoul Games, added to rancour around Japan when she said on Friday her nation had been ""cornered"" into pressing ahead with the Games and accused the JOC of riding roughshod over public opinion.""What will these Olympics be for and for whom? The Games have already lost meaning and are being held just for the sake of them. I believe we have already missed the opportunity to cancel,"" she wrote in an opinion piece for Kyodo news agency.About 3,500 out of over 40,000 ""city volunteers"" recruited by regional governments for the Olympics have pulled out, NHK reported. That adds to 10,000 volunteers who had already withdrawn, according to the organisers.One of the top trending topics on Twitter in Japan on Monday was news of Tokyo police investigating a death on the city's subway, which media reports said involved a senior official at the JOC.Private broadcaster Nippon Television, citing metropolitan police sources, identified the person as someone who worked in the JOC's accounting department and said his death was being treated as a suspected suicide.The police said they were investigating, but did not elaborate.

She added to her billing as the greatest gymnast of all time, putting up a winning score of 119.65, almost a full five points clear of second place Sunisa Lee on 114.95.""It's really emotional, especially going into my second time doing a Olympic run, it's really crazy,"" said Biles, who has won every all-around competition she’s contested since the 2013 U.S. Championships.

The tyre just blew off the rim,"" said Verstappen, who would have gone 15 points clear.""We were fully in control...we lost out on a lot of points, we could have opened up that gap in the championship as well, so to have this happening so close to the end is very frustrating.""Baku's street circuit then provided another crazy twist at the standing re-start after cars had returned to the pit lane for the track to be cleared.Hamilton lined up second, with two laps remaining and set to take back the overall lead.Instead the Briton, his brakes smoking heavily, got it all wrong and his prospective points haul disappeared as he locked up and ran down the escape road in the sprint to the first corner.

""I have to say sorry to Max, it would have been incredible to get that one-two for the team.""But at the end, it was a fantastic day for us.

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",,Metro,,Determined to remain self-reliant,"‘WHEN there is a will, there is a way’ is the best proverb to describe the strong will of Suriati Mat Zin, 44, who decided to make a living by selling doughnuts, despite having to depend on a wheelchair to move around.The mother to a 13-year-old girl also bears the responsibility as the sole breadwinner of the family after her husband Zainal Abidin Ayub, 49, was paralysed from waist down after an accident in 2017.Suriati, who lives in Pasir Mas, Kelantan, said the family used to depend solely on her husband’s income as a rubber tapper to make ends meet.“The idea to sell doughnuts came after my husband lost his source of income as he was unable to work due to his condition.“Besides, I do not want to continue depending on other people’s assistance, ” she told reporters at her house in Kampung Batu Karang in Pasir Mas recently.According to Suriati, she was involved in a road accident in 2012 where she broke her right knee that made her incapable of walking but she fully recovered two years later.“Unfortunately, I got into another accident last year when I skidded while riding a motorcycle that led to severe injuries on my legs.“After the second accident, both of my legs became weak and I now use a wheelchair to move about, ” said Suriati, who receives a RM500 monthly aid from the Social Welfare Department.Despite being a person with disabilities, Suriati said she was able to produce about 100 pieces of doughnuts daily with help from her daughter, Aina Zulaikha.Priced at 30sen per piece, the doughnuts are placed at three shops nearby her house and Suriati is glad that they often get sold out.“I start kneading the dough as early as 3am. I am unable to prepare the dough in large quantity because I knead it manually by hand.“Since the accident, I often get tired easily and both of my hands are not strong enough to knead the flour for a long time, ” she said.In the meantime, Suriati said she was hoping for a three-wheeled motorcycle contribution from any kind donor to ease her movement in transporting the doughnuts to the respective shops.Prior to the interview, the family received a visit from Tuan Zaimah Raja Omar, a representative from the Rantau Panjang Third Force, a non-governmental organisation, who handed over cash assistance of RM200 and an automatic kneading machine worth RM1,800. — Bernama"

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",3:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Crocs look set to be the stars of a pandemic-era fashion world,"What footwear should we all be wearing when we finally get to emerge from our period of Covid-19 social distancing?It seems that, after spending a year lying low – often in slippers – men and women won't be racing back to their high heels or other city-slicking shoe styles as restrictions ease, opting instead for footwear promising style (albeit sometimes questionable) and comfort.As a result, Crocs, sandals and slides are coming back in a big way, poised to accessorise a world of post-pandemic looks.Read more: Think you're stylish, but dress like you did in school? You're just 'cheugy'American e-commerce platform StockX has investigated the trends and looks that are likely to rise in the coming weeks, as well as the boom in online resales of sneakers, streetwear and electronics.As a result, it appears that – despite being considered uncool just a few years ago – certain fashion items have been proving popular since the pandemic.The phenomenon can be put down to this very strange year, spent for a large part in lockdown, wearing gear that was often comfortable, above all.In fact, it's no secret that homewear found many fans during the pandemic, along with jogging pants, sweaters and, more generally, any baggy, comforting styles.As for footwear, sneakers and slippers led the way, relegating stilettos and other city styles to fashion past. And this seems to be continuing as restrictions lift. In fact, there's no radical change in sight.So while summer fashion will no doubt be bold – with a thirst for colour (and glitter) in our lives – there's no way anyone will be ""suffering to look good"". Comfort will still be on the agenda, so it's no surprise to see that sandals and sliders are proving popular with men and women.Crocs are also coming back in a big way. In fact, StockX has seen a 70% increase in the average resale price of these three types of shoe.And that's good news for our feet (but maybe less so for our dignity), which look to have a stress-free summer ahead.Take to the trail!With gyms and clubs closed, outdoor sports and pursuits have also been popular during the pandemic – another trend that looks likely to continue in the coming weeks and months.People (from countries experiencing summer) should be able to make the most of nicer weather to get out for a hike, or head to the mountains.StockX reports that trades of Nike ACG products – the brand's range of all-conditions gear – saw 150% growth in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period a year ago.Read more: Fashion houses look to a different legacy with their anniversary celebrationsA final observation is that resales seem to be riding high, giving rise to a new way of making money.

"Sunday, 06 Jun 2021",2:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,ANDREA FILMER,Malaysian author begins her fantasy trilogy with an epic slice of 'Amok',"Until very recently, all secondary school students faced the big question: science stream or arts stream?For many, it was a no-brainer. And often, not really a choice.Whether or not one intended to pursue a career in the sciences, students who scored in the then PMR examination at the end of Form 3 were generally directed into the science stream unless they made a particular objection.Anna Tan made a particular objection.Growing up in Tanjung Bungah, Penang, the Methodist Girls’ School student did not exactly know what she was going to spend her life doing, but science wasn’t it.“I made the controversial decision that I did not want to go to the science stream, although (people said) that’s ‘where all the smart girls go’.“I remember doing those career guidance and personality tests and the question that came up was if you don’t go into the science stream, what are you going to do? What career can you have if you’re an arts stream student? It’s terribly biased, I know, ” recalls Tan, Malaysian Writers Society (MYWriters) president and author.A bookworm from a young age and a self-professed homebody, Tan did briefly consider jobs that had something to do with the English language.“However, the main career choices mentioned were journalism or teaching – both of which are really fine careers but are people-centric jobs, which tend to stress me out. I figured I liked numbers and was pretty good with them so why not accounting?“There may have been some parental nudging involved since my dad also used to be an accountant. So, the consensus was accounting was a safe, stable career and the writing thing could be done on the side, ” she says.Thus, into the auditing world Tan went.Starting off at KPMG and then moving on into internal auditing at semiconductor manufacturing corporation Atmel, Tan spent nearly a decade working in auditing, which she ironically points out involves a great many people.“I learnt that it meant having to deal with many, many people too, but they do not tell you this at the start!“Anyway, nearly a decade into audit, it got to the point where I couldn’t see my career path. I enjoyed the work, but when the ‘where do you see yourself in five years’ question came up in performance reviews, I could not see myself in a senior manager role, ” says Tan.With a healthy savings account as well as some editing and publishing credits already under her belt, Tan decided to take a leap into the unknown in 2015.Teaspoon PublishingBe it Carrie Bradshaw leisurely typing beside an open window or Oscar Wilde relishing the freedoms of Paris, there is often a romanticised image of those who write and create books.Penang-based Tan, 37, says nothing could be different from reality.In fact, even as her publishing company Teaspoon Publishing turns four this year, she would hardly call herself a full-time writer.“(Being a writer is) stressful! I don’t know if I technically count as a ‘full-time writer’. I do more editing and formatting jobs with Teaspoon Publishing than actually sitting down and writing my own novels.“Unless you have already built up a huge backlist that is paying you a steady and sustainable income or you have other streams of passive income or funding, there is no way you can be a full-time fiction writer in Malaysia. You’ll always be looking for additional jobs on the side to cover expenses, ” she says.Tan, whose lists Terry Pratchett, Robin Hobb, CS Lewis and Zen Cho among her favourite authors, currently has two novellas (short novels) in the market, along with a healthy number of short stories and even a libretto (text in a musical or vocal work) which was her first major writing project.“I wrote a libretto called Star Of Persia in 2003 for a musical that was produced by FGA Centre.“I’ve been writing since school, so I’ve come out with a lot of stuff!My first published work was probably a short story in Phases, a youth magazine by Scripture Union back in the late 1990s.“But my first professional sale would likely be Codes in Fixi Novo’s Cyberpunk: Malaysia in 2015, ” she says.Participating in NaNoWriMo (the National Novel Writing Month initiative based in the USA) throughout college, Tan remembers a breakthrough in 2013 when she got the job to be the editor for the Love In Penang anthology published by Fixi Novo.After a couple years of freelancing, Tan heard about a former classmate who had been awarded a Chevening Scholarship and decided to throw her hat into the ring as well.This brought her to Brunel University London where she spent a year completing an MA in Creative Writing: The Novel, submitting the first 15 chapters of Amok to clinch the dissertation prize.The 'Absolution' trilogyA royal bloodline on which superhuman power is bestowed, a stunning queen from a former rival kingdom and predictions of doom and destruction from the priesthood fill Amok, Tan’s first full-length novel, which is available now.Set in a fantasy world that is loosely based on the Melaka sultanate, Malaysian readers will recognise distinct, homegrown elements sewn throughout Tan’s imaginary realm, including ranks of nobility, religious gatherings and the use of keris as weapons.“When I sent an early version out to beta readers, it was the Malaysian readers who found the words and terms the most jarring!As fantasy readers are used to conlang (constructed or fictional languages), my US and UK friends had very few problems with the terms, though I ultimately decided to add a glossary to aid with that.“When discussing my difficulty in choosing how to use certain terms depending on actual meaning, my editor was like: I didn’t know they were real words! I thought you made them up!” Tan laughs.She adds that in spite of the familiar references, the world created in her young adult novel is entirely imaginary.“As much as I use a historical Melaka sultanate as a jumping off point, it is not meant to be anywhere on earth.“One of the things the MA really got me delving into was the settings of my stories. Why did I default to a Eurocentric fantasy world and terms? What could I do to take it out of that? What does being Malaysian really mean?”Tan acknowledges that international publishing houses are starting to celebrate and push for diverse voices, looking for writing from cultures all over the world.“What was I doing recreating white countries?” she asks.Amok, which follows young Putera Mikal on his journey to fulfil a prophecy, will be followed by The Tale Of The Hostage Prince, set for release in December, and Absolution, which interestingly enough, was the first novel of the series that Tan wrote.“I pitched it to several agents and editors, even in some competitions. I had full requests and it was one of the finalists for The Future Bookshelf project (by publishing company Hachette Book Group) in 2018, but it never quite fit anywhere.“At the time, a friend of mine was retelling the story of Moses... in space. And I was like, well, this whole supernatural strength thing I’d been mooting has some relationship to Samson and Delilah, what can I do with that? That’s how the early outline of Amok came about, ” says Tan, adding that in order to suit the new background of the book series, she spent two months completely redrafting the original Absolution during a residency at the Rimbun Dahan arts centre last year.Both remaining books in the trilogy are in the editing stage and the whole series will be self published by Tan’s Teaspoon Publishing.“Self-publishing was a very deliberate choice from the start, though I’ve wavered back and forth on it in the interim.“Part of it is the control but mostly it’s the fact that there are no publishers in Malaysia that specialise in the fantasy genre in English.""The local English market tends to be pulp, horror or historical fiction circa WWII. I did look at getting traditionally published overseas, but that is a very long, arduous journey, ” she adds.On the future, Tan, who heads the MYWriters group and is the primary editor for local branch MYWriters Penang’s annual zine NutMag, says expanding the local fantasy genre in the country is one of her long-term goals.“I keep complaining about there being no fantasy publisher in Malaysia and it’s on the bucket list to be able to do that with Teaspoon Publishing eventually, ” says Tan."

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",4:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,,Country singer Dolly Parton wears makeup to sleep in case she’s forced out of her home by earthquake or storm,"Singer Dolly Parton’s beauty regime consists of cleaning up her face in the morning, followed by putting on makeup.She would then just touch up throughout the day, and not clean her face at night.There are two reasons for this, which she revealed in a recent interview with WSJ Magazine.“Because I never know if there’s going to be an earthquake or a tornado or a storm and I’m going to have to go out in the middle of the night!” the 75-year-old explained.She added: “I don’t like to go home and just tear down completely, because my poor husband has to look at me.”The 9 To 5 hitmaker also spoke on the importance of being comfortable in one’s own skin when finding their style.In the article, she shared the origin of her unique look, calling it as “glamorous trash”.The legendary country singer said: “My own overexaggerated look came from a serious place I’ve often spoken about: the town tramp in our little country hometown.“They called her trash, but to me she was absolutely beautiful.“She wore colourful patchwork skirts and pretty blouses and showed a little cleavage and had red nails and piled-up blond hair and red lipstick and high heels.“She was the prettiest thing I’d ever seen.“When everybody would say, ‘Oh, she’s just trash’, I’d say, ‘Well, trash is what I’m going to grow up to be.’“And I guess my look is glamorous trash!”"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",3:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,End is near for South Africa's million-dollar lion-breeding industry,"The lion cub, a ball of soft, brown fur with sharp little teeth at only several weeks old, wriggles around in the tourist’s arms as she tries to pose for a cute picture with the animal on a farm not far from the South African capital, Pretoria.Animal rights campaigners from the Humane Society International’s Africa branch (HSI-Africa) have come down strongly against these wildlife selfies, which were a common scene before the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing travel restrictions that killed off tourism.These selfies are just one part of the million-dollar industry that is private lion-breeding on South Africa’s Cape. Thousands of lions are raised in enclosures on private property to later be hunted by big-game hunters from Europe, the United States and other regions.Such a practice is called a “canned lion hunt”. And Environment Minister Barbara Creecy wants to put an end to it in the future, as well as the breeding of lions in captivity. She recently presented extensive recommendations on ways to finally stamp the practice out.As part of her argument, the South African minister, who is not against hunting lions in the wild, raises the ethical question of what shooting a lion bred in captivity in a fenced-in area has to do with a real hunt. “Preventing the hunting of captive lions is in the interests of the authentic wild hunting industry, ” Creecy argues.HSI-Africa wildlife director Audrey Delsink welcomes the move: The South African government has finally adopted “recommendations to end the abhorrent captive-lion breeding industry. Lions will no longer have to suffer in horrid conditions for someone’s selfie, ” she says.Even if they are just recommendations, Delsink sees the move as a huge success for the country’s lions. She estimates that there are nearly 11,000 captive-bred lions on over 260 lion farms nationwide.The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) was also jubilant following the news. In a statement, South African regional director Neil Greenwood calls the practice one of the worst animal welfare abuses of modern times and stresses that it took two decades of lobbying and the deaths of thousands of lions to finally see change.An analysis from HSI looking at trade in mammals included on the CITES endangered species list found that a total of 4,176 lion trophies were exported from South Africa between 2014 and 2018.Within the European Union, Germany is one of the main import countries for such trophies, and after Americans and Spaniards, Germans make up the strongest group of big-game hunters numbers-wise, according to the Pro Wildlife animal protection organisation.Lucrative earningsAccording to private providers, shooting a lion or similar animal in the Cape costs around US$24,000 (RM99,270). A three-week hunting trip can quickly add up to over US$120,000 (RM496,360).South Africa’s lion-breeding industry argues that trophy hunting saves certain species from extinction – an argument similarly made by Botswana or Zimbabwe when they need to justify elephant-hunting.Creecy also considers highly regulated trophy-hunting programmes to be an important part of wildlife conservation, as well as a way for local communities to earn a livelihood. But how much of the money actually reaches the local population is a topic up for debate.Stephan Wunderlich, an expert in hunting abroad for the German Hunting Association (DJV), warns against confusing shooting lions in enclosed areas with sustainable hunting. “It’s a real branch of the industry – comparable to cattle farming – and limited to South Africa, ” he says. Hunting associations have opposed it for years.In countries like Namibia, Botswana or Zimbabwe, free-ranging, individual lions are shot in order to regulate the population, or in cases of animal-human conflict, according to Wunderlich.“This also applies to elephants. In Botswana, for example, a population of at least 135,000 elephants ensures that the animals permanently destroy their own habitat – and that of other species.”But animal rights activists see another another problem: While the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species prohibits the trade of wild lion bones, the bones of captive lions can be exported from South Africa. But since it is almost impossible to distinguish between the body parts of wild and captive lions, they believe this encourages the smuggling of bones from wild lions. – dpa/Ralf E. Krueger"

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",1:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,TENGKU PUTERI IMAN AFZAN,Decriminalising suicide essential in mental health fight,"In my column last month on teaching children about mental health in school, I wrote about the suicide of a nine-year-old girl.Since then, we have read about – or in some cases, seen – at least three incidents of suicide.Significant efforts have been made by various stakeholders across the board to decriminalise attempted suicide in our country.I spoke about the need to do so on World Suicide Prevention Day in September 2020 at the opening of The Orchid Clubhouse – the first activity and crisis management centre at the Mental Illness Awareness and Support Association (Miasa).The Green Ribbon Group, which I co-founded earlier this year (2021), also released a statement on April 5 (2021) on the need to review legislation and rebuild our current systemic responses towards suicide attempts.I wish to reiterate some of the points that I have made, for suicide prevention must always be ongoing.Help, not hinderFirst, decriminalising suicide must be seen as part and parcel of shifting our response to mental health towards one that is more health- and social-based.It must also be done carefully, with the understanding that a person who attempts suicide is likely to be mentally distressed.Indeed, 2020 was a very challenging year.This year (2021) is also shaping up to be just as challenging, if not more so.Data from the Health Ministry is indicative of the upward trend of mental health issues as a result of the current Covid-19 pandemic.Out of 145,173 calls received from last May (2020) to this May (2021), 85.5% were related to mental health issues such as acute stress, anxiety, depression, abuse and suicidal behaviour.There were also 1,080 cases of suicide attempts from January to December 2020.The development of a national registry system for cases of suicide and fatal injury, as stated in the National Action Plan for Mental Health over the next five years, is most timely.The move to decriminalise attempted suicide thus requires urgent and in-depth consideration.Second, throughout my mental health journey, I have always felt that stigma is the biggest hurdle that we face.It must be said more and more that if we continue to persist in penalising those who have resigned themselves to leaving this world to escape the misery in their lives, we will only continue to perpetuate the stigmatisation of mental health.Those who attempt suicide must be given a helping hand.Paradoxically, attempted suicide being seen as a crime only discourages such individuals from seeking help.Without a doubt, there must first be sustainable and viable mechanisms in place for individuals who attempt suicide to access mental healthcare and be suitably evaluated to allow the law to be applied.Fortunately, in most cases, the implementation of the relevant law in our country has been tempered with mercy.But while we work towards revising relevant legislation to fight against stigmatisation and decrease the rate of suicide, we need to also increase our efforts in building a nation where individuals can seek help for their mental health challenges without fear or hesitation.This brings me to my third and final point: mental health is the responsibility of all, and we need to get the message across that suicide is largely preventable.Remember, it may not always be easy to identify who needs help as many continue to go through the motions of living, while being dragged down by the burden of psychological distress within them.We may be able to do only so much, but even that little care and connection may make a world of difference to those who are alone in their agony.Reach outThe Green Ribbon Group, in collaboration with the Malaysian Mental Health Association (MMHA), will sponsor anyone who is keen to complete the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) programme, which includes detecting and assisting someone with suicidal behaviour.Please visit our website and our Instagram page for more information. You may also visit the MMHA website.Connectedness is crucial to those vulnerable to suicide, and reaching out to them and providing them the support and companionship they direly need could be lifesaving.Every one of you reading this column can contribute in some way, however big or small, in raising awareness for suicide prevention.United we stand, divided we fall.I remain humbled and inspired by all your efforts.Editor’s note: This column will be taken over by consultant psychiatrist Datuk Dr Andrew Mohanraj, who is the Green Ribbon Group policy advisor and Malaysian Mental Health Association president beginning July 2021.Tengku Puteri Iman Afzan is the Royal Patron of the National Coalition of Mental Wellbeing and International Patron of World Mental Health Day 2020.

We are following all safety protocols and will continue to monitor the situation,” Paramount Pictures stated, as quoted in the report.Fourteen people, specifically four dancers and 10 crew members, were said to have tested positive for Covid-19 on set, according to The Sun on June 3. Cruise himself had to self-isolate.This was not the first time production for Mission: Impossible 7 had to be stopped. Back in Feburary 2020 in Italy, cast and crew had to stop filming as lockdowns were imposed in the country because of the pandemic. Filming resumed by fall, but was delayed a week in October 2020 after 12 people tested positive for Covid-19.By December 2020, an audio recording released by The Sun went viral. In the tape obtained by the publication, Cruise, who also acts as producer of the film, was caught shouting at members of the crew who reportedly violated Covid-19 safety procedures by not practicing social distancing.Mission: Impossible 7 is written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Cruise will reprise his role as IMF agent Ethan Hunt for the film, set for release on May 27, 2022. - Philippine Daily Inquirer/Asia News Network"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",10:30 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,It is fun and entertaining but how safe is TikTok safe for children?,"While TikTok videos are entertaining to watch and can sometimes even be educational and meaningful, the growing popularity of this social media application among children aged between four and 13 can be a cause for concern.As some local experts have pointed out, unrestrained use of the app can lead to negative effects, the most worrying among them being exposure to sexual predators, as well as privacy violations.TikTok is a Chinese video-sharing social networking service that is used to make a variety of short-form videos, each with a duration of 15 seconds to one minute.Universiti Putra Malaysia Teaching Hospital psychiatrist Dr Ruziana Masiran, who is also a lecturer at the Medicine and Health Science Faculty, said although TikTok users below 13 are supposed to watch the censored version of the content posted on this platform, many of them may lie about their age to gain access to the uncensored content.“TikTok is increasingly becoming the app of choice for children in Malaysia. In fact, children as young as four years already know about it and watch whatever is uploaded on the app,” she told Bernama, adding that the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has led to an increase in TikTok usage because many people are staying at home all day.According to United Kingdom-based market research company Global Web Index, as of February 2020, TikTok had an estimated 800 million active users worldwide. In the United States, the amount of time TikTok users spent on the app doubled from 38 minutes a day in May 2019 to 82 minutes a day in February 2020.Dr Ruziana said the Global Web Index also showed that 90% of TikTok users visited the site more than once a day, with most of them spending nearly five minutes on the app which was longer than the time they spent on other social media apps such as Snapchat and Instagram.“Although 41% of TikTok users worldwide are aged between 16 and 21, one-third of users in the United States are aged below 14,” she said, adding that data released by parental control software company Qustodio showed that in the US, children aged from four to 14 spent an average of 82 minutes a day watching content on Tik Tok and 86 minutes a day watching YouTube videos between February 2019 and April 2020.Privacy concernsWhile the TikTok platform’s simplified framework provides an avenue for children and teenagers to express their creativity and also gives them free access to professional video, audio and photo editing software, the negative aspects of this video-sharing site cannot be ignored.As Dr Ruziana pointed out, TikTok can potentially expose young users to sexual predators and sexual grooming.“Although this platform is striving to reduce the risk of exposure to sexual predators, the issue will prevail as long as adult users keep uploading sexually explicit photographs and messages. Parents should lodge police reports against such users,” she said.TikTok usage can also lead to privacy leakage which, stressed Dr Ruziana, is even more dangerous as it puts the safety of the children and their families at stake.“For example, if the children make (and share) videos of them inside or outside their homes, they would unwittingly be showing the interior of their homes and their parents’ cars and number plates, and sharing their locations as well,” she said.And, since TikTok provides an essentially infinite amount of content, children and teenagers are also likely to get hooked to it and end up watching videos for hours at a time.“Apps such as TikTok can easily be used by predators to influence the children targeted by them. This app is used worldwide and there are no restrictions on who can use it,” she said, adding that young users can also become obsessive about their appearance.“They are always trying to improve their looks in a bid to attract the attention of their followers and others. These children and teenagers also spend so much of their time making their own videos that their relationships with their families and friends suffer. They don’t have a social life at all.”Parental controlDr Ruziana added that the young users are also at risk of receiving negative comments to the videos they have posted, which may cause their self-worth and self-esteem levels to plummet.“This is an issue faced by users of all types of social media platforms. The more users the platform has, the higher the chances of drawing negative comments,” she said.Urging parents to monitor their children’s online activities, Dr Ruziana said they should follow their children’s social media accounts and ensure that the privacy settings are properly adjusted to prevent leakage of personal data.For TikTok, she suggested that parents use its Family Pairing feature, a parental control tool that lets parents link their child’s TikTok account with their own, giving them direct control over the child’s privacy settings.She said parents should also teach their children to control the comment section of their social media accounts, whether they are private or public.“Tell the children they have the power to decide whether they want to allow comments from everyone or their followers only,” she added.DetrimentalPsychologist Prof Datin Dr Mariani Md Nor, who is attached to SEGi University in Petaling Jaya, also agreed that parental control was necessary for young users of TikTok, which she described as a beneficial app as it helps children to tap their creativity and build their self-confidence, as well as expand their language development aspect.On the flip side is privacy leakage as a child user’s personal data can be stolen by undesirable elements should his or her videos go viral.“The child’s privacy will be violated and they can also be targeted by paedophiles who are always on the lookout for children’s images which they can easily get from viewing TikTok videos,” she added.Dr Mariani also said that allowing children to use TikTok without any monitoring by their parents can have detrimental effects, especially if the young users choose to watch content with sexual elements as it can influence their thinking, feelings and behaviour.“And, if left unrestrained, these children would use TikTok as a platform to express their own emotions and feelings, ” she said, adding that while TikTok has its positive features, its ‘dark side’ can have an impact on the growth and development of young users. – Bernama"

According to a report from UCLA University, TV programmes could help some viewers overcome depression, social anxiety, as well as deal with issues of sexual harassment, if the shows address these topics with empathy.""Our research found that when teens watch TV shows that portray mental health issues, they actually talk about it with their peers, parents and partners,"" explained Dr Yalda T. Uhls, executive director of the Center for Scholars and Storytellers, in a press release.Teen drama series 13 Reasons Why, available on Netflix, addresses issues such as suicide and depression. The researchers wanted to know the effects of the series on the mental health of adolescents. After the airing of Season Three in the United States, they interviewed 157 children aged 13 to 17 via a questionnaire in order to measure their knowledge on topics related to mental health.""Our results demonstrate that these kinds of challenging and realistic stories inspire youth to talk about and learn more about mental health,"" noted Dr. Yalda T. Uhls. Of the 68 teens who watched the series, 62 were educated to the point of doing research on the subject. It's believed that the series facilitated discussion about mental health issues between these teens and their loved ones.The actors and producers of the series also helped inform and educate the young audience about these disorders. The study underlines the importance of social media for spreading information and encourages this type of initiative to be repeated in the future. – AFP Relaxnews"

For a full list of numbers and operating hours, go to befrienders.org.my/centre-in-malaysia.Dear Thelma,The issues that our daughter is currently facing in her workplace with her colleagues are taking a toll on us as parents.Our daughter is currently attached to a government hospital as a doctor, and puts her heart and soul into her work at all times. She tries to do everything possible to have a good working relationship with her peers, bosses as well as the support staff.However as the majority of her colleagues (doctors) are of the same ethnic group, they for no apparent reason seem to gang up against her and always communicate in a language that is not familiar to her and appear to have issues with her on a constant basis thus creating a toxic environment.In order to keep abreast of the conversations that go on in their dialect, my daughter has subscribed to online learning sessions. But it is not easy to learn a language from scratch and at the same time do your best at the workplace.In the course of her work, she makes sure she does not leave her job as soon as her shift is over but, instead, takes time to fully update the doctor taking over, to ensure continuity before clocking off without any disruption.She also cannot seek refuge by laying bare her problems to her higher-ups because, from past experience, she knows it will make matters more unbearable as she will be seen as a “non-team player”.She has tried every possible way to build a happy working relationship with the doctors such as showering them with gifts and food but this has not had the desired effect.We fear all this may affect her mental health.We have been reading your column for a long time, and are amazed at your replies and solutions which really prep up many a lost soul.Distressed ParentsDear Distressed Parents,I'm so sorry your daughter is being bullied at work.Thank you so much for your kind comments about the column. I hope I can offer some useful suggestions.You note that you are affected, but the letter focuses entirely on your daughter. I'm guessing that you are stressed as you feel helpless? As such, here are some thoughts that you might share with her.Toxic workplaces are the pits but, sadly, they are commonplace. Your daughter has already seen that the managers are part of this abusive environment, so there is no point in going there for help.I think the best way to tackle it is to take a look at why this happens and what her options are.Bullying is where a person or group derive their power from abusing others. People make excuses for bullies but I think you should remember the fundamentals here: bullies enjoy hurting others; they get real satisfaction from it.Because they know that this is wrong, they make up fake reasons to support their actions. Common excuses for violence are that the victims are different in looks, religion, language or that they don't speak, think, or live in the same way. It can be as simple as a like for a different football team.Your daughter's bullies tell themselves that their birthplace, ethnicity or mother tongue makes them special and that it gives them the right to abuse others. This is complete nonsense. Everyone is entitled to dignity and respect.Your daughter has tried to placate them. I understand why. There are many of them, and she is alone. And with normal, nice people, we make friends by sharing common ground.But these bullies are not nice, normal people. They have no intention of accepting her because being mean to her makes them feel good about themselves. They will not give up this behaviour because the status quo suits them.If they were children, I'd recommend a good sit-down and a talk. But these are adults, doctors even, who should know better.My first suggestion is that your daughter needs a support group. As she's a victim of bullying, she will be tired from being picked on. It may lead to depression and affect her self-esteem.It's important to recognise that we know logically that bullies are bad people, but in our hearts we can't help but wonder why they pick on us. The mind is a funny thing; we would not tell a friend to question why they are victims, but we victim-blame ourselves rather easily.A support group will help your daughter keep her spirits up and give her a safe space to vent. Gather people from her old school, from her neighbourhood and perhaps a few older family members. Lean in.Remind her often: her own values and her excellent work are what matters. What people of proven bad principles say or think is unimportant.Also, there will be others who are bullied at work. Have her connect with them. She need not be bosom buddies; being allies is good enough.Next, consider a change. Can she transfer to a different shift, to a different department, to a different hospital? Perhaps she can go for some kind of training, just to get away for a while. Can she go private? Or perhaps work in an associated field, like a scientific foundation?As her managers are also toxic, it is possible that they will try to limit her options. Therefore, I suggest she talks to a lawyer who specialises in labour law and preferably someone who has experience with the MOH.Usually, suing an employer doesn't work well unless you leave your job. However, if you are looking for a transfer, knowing your rights can help. Sometimes, it opens up other avenues of thought.Finally, these bullies pick on your daughter because she is alone and they know the bosses won't help. But if your daughter had a skill the bosses were frightened of losing, she would have allies. As bullying is a pervasive issue, I strongly suggest she becomes an expert.Ideally, this would be specialist training. But learning to use a particular tool like a diagnostic machine may be enough. In a big organisation, sitting on a committee can bring influence as well.She may consider public speaking, even. All hospitals want doctors who speak to the public and many staff are terrified of this. If your daughter became the go-to person to give talks, the bosses would take notice – and they might do the decent thing and give her a bit of support.I hope this was helpful. Think over all the options carefully and consult. Don't do anything in a rush. And if it helps, please know I'll be thinking good thoughts for you all. Such a dedicated soul deserves lots of success and happiness."
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Tech,,Creating Android apps from text is now a real thing,"Researchers have developed a framework capable of creating Android applications from textual descriptions. Could it be a game-changer when it comes to app creation?In some ways it’s nothing short of a mini revolution. Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) have succeeded in developing a framework that can create an application on Android from text. They trained a translation model to generate representations in an intermediate language they created.This method is different from other existing techniques that use raw code. The latter are based on neural machine translation, similar to that used by Google Translate, and “translate” human language into source code. While these methods work, they are unable to create larger programs with hundreds of lines of code. This is what motivated the researchers to create a new language that would capture the complexity of source code by representing it in textual form.“Our research group at the Department of CSE, BUET works on bridging the gap between human language and programming language to make computer programming more accessible,” Masum Hasan, one of the researchers who worked on the study, told TechXplore.“We designed an intermediate formal language...We then developed a compiler that can convert the compact representation into actual source code and trained a neural machine translation model to translate natural language to this intermediate format, which can then be compiled into an app.”Text2App, an open source revolutionBy transforming text descriptions into this language, the researchers were able to create full-fledged mobile applications, which had proved unfeasible with previously proposed methods.This “framework” created by the team of researchers is called Text2App and allows the creation of Android applications using English text only. You just have to describe the desired application and the framework takes care of the rest.If this still sounds a bit mysterious, try to imagine it more simply. Describing an idea, a button, a menu is rather simple thanks to text and there is no need for more. The compiler takes care of the specifics of the code by offering solutions.In the future, various researchers' work will allow for the introduction of new ways of summarising or representing programs. This will allow novices to better understand how the technology of artificial intelligence works, as well as jobs related to coding. This new language will also improve the ability to convert natural languages into an app format.“If we design programming languages or frameworks with AI in mind, our current AI technologies can perform remarkably better in code generation from human language,” outlined Hasan.The researchers have so far only explored a fraction of their program’s true capabilities, so they are offering the opportunity to the open source community to contribute to its evaluation and propose developments.Hasan and his team also hope to use deep-learning machines like the GPT-3, founded by the company OpenAI, to create even more complex applications. – AFP Relaxnews"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",4:56 PM MYT,Tech,MATHIEU ROSEMAIN,Google to change global advertising practices in landmark antitrust deal,"PARIS (Reuters) -Google said it would make changes to its global advertising business to ensure it did not abuse its dominance, bowing to antitrust pressure for the first time in a landmark settlement with French authorities.The deal with the French competition watchdog could help rebalance the power over advertising in favour of publishers, which held sway over the business in the pre-internet era but lost control with the rapid rise of Google and Facebook.The settlement, which was announced on Monday and also saw Google fined 220 million euros ($268 million), is the first time the U.S. tech giant has agreed to make changes to its huge advertising business, which brings in the bulk of its revenue.""The decision to sanction Google is of particular significance because it's the first decision in the world focusing on the complex algorithmic auction processes on which the online ad business relies,"" said France's antitrust chief Isabelle de Silva.The watchdog found that Google's ad management platform for large publishers - Google Ad Manager - favoured the company's own online ad marketplace - Google AdX - where publishers sell space to advertisers in real-time.Ad Manager provided AdX with strategic data such as the winning bidding prices, while AdX also enjoyed privileged access to requests made by advertisers via Google's ad services, the authority said.AdX, in turn, exchanged data more smoothly with Ad Manager than it did with other advertising management platforms, the watchdog added. Such platforms are crucial for publishers to manage and sell advertising space.Under the terms of the settlement, Google made commitments to improve the way Ad Manager services worked with rival ad servers and ad space sales platforms, the French watchdog said. Some changes would be implemented by the first quarter of 2022, it said, adding that Google would not appeal the decision.Google also said it had agreed to make it easier for publishers to use its data and tools.""We will be testing and developing these changes over the coming months before rolling them out more broadly, including some globally,"" the company added.'RIGHTLY SANCTIONED'Many publishers globally have been infuriated over ad practices employed by the tech giants, whose success relies on the trove of data it has amassed over the years.Most of Google's sales come from search and YouTube ads. But last year about $23 billion was tied to helping publishers sell ads, drawing antitrust scrutiny to the connections between Google's businesses, plus calls from some critics to break up the sprawling company.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the antitrust decision.""The practices put in place by Google to favour its own advertising technologies have affected press groups, whose business model is heavily dependent on ad revenues,"" he said.""These are serious practices and they have been rightly sanctioned.""The French authority said the decision opens the way for publishers who felt disadvantaged to seek damages from Google.It launched its investigation in 2019 following a complaint from News Corp., French news publishing group Le Figaro and Belgian press group Rossel.The three publishers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.($1 = 0.8225 euros)(Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Christian Lowe and Pravin Char)"

Europe's tech stocks index was flat.""The details of the implementation are still to be ironed out and potentially further watered down,"" said Marija Vertimane, senior strategist at State Street Global Markets.Dublin, which has resisted European Union attempts to harmonize its tax rules, is unlikely to accept a higher minimum rate without a fight.""I would treat the current proposal as a small positive for the market,"" Vertimane added pointing to levies being lower than what was initially discussed.The G7's proposals are seen targeting technology companies that sell services remotely and attribute much of their profits to intellectual properly held in low-tax jurisdictions.""The immediate market implications are likely to be minimal,"" said Ian Williams, economics & strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt.""No G7 nation currently charges that low a rate and the details, including agreement from numerous smaller countries, require plenty of work.""(Reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Sagarika JaisinghaniEditing by Rachel Armstrong, William Maclean and Bernadette Baum)"

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",11:00 AM MYT,Tech,,"Manipulating Twitter Trends is possible, and it’s dangerous","Research from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EFPL) in Switzerland has found that it is possible to manipulate Twitter Trends. The findings prove, for the first time, that many trends are created solely by bots exploiting a vulnerability in the Twitter algorithm.The Twitter Trends tool is a formidable window onto the everyday topics proving popular among web users at any given time. It is sometimes used by the media to report on the significance or even the existence of a topic or social phenomenon.For the social network, it is also one of the main vectors for increasing engagement and thus creating a viable business model. Indeed, Twitter Trends can sometimes be used as an advertising channel.Twitter even makes use of this by charging companies for brand promotion on Trends for a day. Users, on the other hand, want Trends to be the result of genuine activity.In order to identify its trending topics (i.e., the most commented-on topics) the platform uses an algorithm that detects the hashtags popular at a given moment. This alerts users to the most popular words, phrases or topics, globally and locally. All in all, it's a considerable mechanism of influence.However, EPFL research has found that the reality of Twitter Trends can be quite different. Focusing on Trends in Turkey, the institution discovered a flaw in the Twitter algorithm by which the social network does not take into account deleted tweets.As a result, it becomes all too easy to push one trend more than another to the top of Twitter Trends.Tuğrulcan Elmas, one of the authors of the research, explains: “We found that 47% of local trends in Turkey and 20% of global trends are fake, created from scratch by bots. Between June 2015 and September 2019, we uncovered 108,000 bot accounts involved, the biggest bot dataset reported in a single paper. Our research is the first to uncover the manipulation of Twitter Trends at this scale.”Twitter has been warnedFake trends – a trick known as Astroturfing – can fall into all kinds of categories, such as misinformation campaigns, political slogans, hate speech, gambling promotions and phishing applications. As part of their study, the researchers demonstrate a case study using the example of CiftlikBank, or “Farm Bank”, a Ponzi scheme that claimed to be a farming company seeking fast, aggressive growth.The firm used ephemeral Astroturfing attacks to promote itself 29 times in Turkish Twitter Trends, using slogans about facility openings or celebrating one year in business. This allowed the company to pose as a growing business. At the first sign of suspicion, it used another hashtag “#WetrustinCiftlikBank” and pushed it as a trend. The CiftlikBank boss then defrauded US$129mil (RM532.51mil) before fleeing in March 2018.This story demonstrates the considerable risks of tools of influence being open to manipulation. Aware of the danger, the researchers tried to warn Twitter on two occasions.Although the American company recognised a vulnerability in its algorithm, it refused to make any changes. “The problem has not been fixed and we still see obvious spam trends occurring. It’s clear that until the vulnerability in the algorithm is corrected, adversaries will continue to create fake trends with the same attack methodology,” concludes Elmas. – AFP Relaxnews"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Tech,,"Survey: Smartphone, broadband usage grows in US","WASHINGTON: The vast majority of US adults now use a smartphone and have high-speed Internet at home, following modest growth over the past two years, a survey showed on June 3.The Pew Research Center said 85% of adults have smartphones, up from 81% in 2019, while 77% reported home broadband subscriptions, four percentage points higher than in a similar survey two years earlier.The survey showed 91% had Internet access either from a smartphone or home broadband, Pew said.But the figures show a stubbornly large segment of the population lacking home broadband, with many people saying the cost is too high either for a computer or an Internet subscription.The survey, taken as more people rely on the Internet for work, school and other activities, also showed 30% of respondents often or sometimes experienced problems connecting to the Internet at home. That included 9% who say such problems happen often.The researchers found roughly 15% of US adults are “smartphone-only” Internet users, who have no broadband connection at home.The survey also found smartphone usage correlated with age, with 96% of 18- to 29-year-olds using mobile handsets compared with 61% for those over 65. Smartphone adoption was also correlated to higher household income and higher levels of education.For home broadband – a topic being debated by US lawmakers and policymakers seeking to encourage Internet adoption – income levels were a key factor. Just 57% of those with household incomes under US$30,000 (RM123,840) annually had high-speed connections, compared with more than 90% for those earning more than US$75,000 (RM309,600).“While there has been slight growth in the share who say they subscribe to high-speed Internet, about a quarter of the population still does not have a broadband Internet connection at home,” said the report led by researcher Andrew Perrin.“And broadband non-adopters continue to cite financial constraints as one of the most important reasons why they forgo these services.”The report was based on a survey of 1,502 US adults from Jan 25 to Feb 8 by cell and landline phone with an estimated margin of error of 2.9 percentage points. – AFP"

It cannot be forged or otherwise manipulated.Sotheby's has no pre-sale estimate for ""Quantum"", which had already reached $140,000 on Friday, a day after it went on sale. The sale ends on June 10.""In 10 years looking back, if in fact these are to grow, this piece can represent and symbolise the start of something that is quite revolutionary and very impactful,"" said Max Moore, vice president of contemporary art at Sotheby's in New York.NFT exchanges happen in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on specialist sites. Traditional auction houses are seeking to capitalise on the new phenomenon.""I fell in love with Bitcoin in early 2013 and just got really interested in that world,"" said McCoy, a 54-year-old multimedia artist.He is a pioneer of NFTs that currently generate several hundred million dollars in transactions every month.McCoy even helped design his own platform for the exchange of certified digital objects: Monograph, which is no longer active.""There was a lot of misunderstanding at the time,"" McCoy recalled, saying the mainstream art world struggled to understand the cryptocurrency world, which had itself had little appreciation of art.He says the craze is only just beginning, but refuses to consider how huge it may become.""The Sotheby's thing is... a big test to see what happens as far as that goes. Honestly, I don't have any expectations,"" McCoy added.The NFT boom is being fueled by early investors in cryptocurrencies who became millionaires.In March, Christie's sold an NFT for $69.3 million.Sotheby's held its first NFT auction in April.

"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",6:18 PM MYT,Tech,FOO YUN CHEE,Critics still unhappy as EU clarifies revamped copyright rules,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Commission on Friday defined the scope of revised copyright rules adopted last year following criticism from governments, including France and Poland, but EU broadcasters and internet activists said there was a danger of censorship.The revamped copyright directive, the first overhaul in two decades, aimed to provide fair compensation for the bloc's $1 trillion creative industry and its 11.7 million employees.A central provision, Article 17, backed by the creative industry, would force Google-owned YouTube, Facebook's Instagram and other sharing platforms to install filters to prevent users from uploading copyrighted materials.It triggered a fierce lobbying battle, pitting artists and news publishers against tech companies, internet activists and consumer groups, with France saying the Commission's stance could weaken Article 17, while Poland is challenging it through the European courts.The platforms can be sued for making copyright-infringing content available to the public, even when it has been uploaded by their users. Critics say filters are costly and could lead to erroneous blocking.EU countries have until June 7 to transpose the directive into national law.The Commission in its policy paper published on Friday said Article 17 would only apply to online service providers and online audio and video streaming service providers that make money from copyrighted work uploaded to their platforms by their users.Not-for-profit online encyclopaedias and educational bodies, open source software platforms and online marketplaces would be exempt.Companies may also escape liability if they can show they have done their best to obtain authorisation for copyrighted works on their platforms and acted speedily to remove content when notified.To mollify internet activists, the Commission said Article 17 should not apply to caricature, parody, criticism, review and quotation.It said automated blocking of content should be limited to manifestly infringing uploads and EU countries should provide a complaint and redress mechanism to service providers so that their users can use it in the event of disputes.Authoritarian governments can abuse automated blocking of content to go after critics, lobby group European Digital Rights (EDRi) said.""This sets a dangerous precedent for future European legislation and for other governments around the world that would get inspired by legalised copyright censorship in Europe,"" its head of policy Diego Naranjo said.The Association of Commercial Television in Europe was also critical and predicted the guidance would be ignored.""This very last minute non-binding guidance is manifestly contentious and very likely to be challenged,"" ACT Director-General Gregoire Polad said in a statement.Facebook had no immediate comment and Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Kirsten Donovan and Barbara Lewis)"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,News,IVAN LOH,Not all need to update health status,"IPOH: The air has been cleared and it is confirmed that not all MySejahtera users are legally required to update their health status on the app, with police saying they would make a request to cancel the compounds issued to 29 people for the non-existent “offence”.Perak police chief Datuk Comm Mior Faridalathrash Wahid (pic) said the issue about compound notices issued to 29 oil and gas company staffers in Sitiawan for failing to update their health status on MySejahtera would be brought to the attention of the Manjung Health Department.The request would then be relayed to the Attorney General’s Chambers to cancel the compounds, he added.“There was some confusion over the matter and Manjung police had checked and gotten clarification on the incident with the Health Ministry’s inspectorate and legal unit.“The Health Ministry confirmed that only those with symptoms, have a history of travelling abroad, have relations or close contact with a Covid-19 positive patient, need to update their health status on the MySejahtera app, ” he said in a statement yesterday.News of factory workers in Manjung being issued compound notices for not updating their health status on MySejahtera had caused concern among the public over the weekend.Prior to this, videos had been circulating on WhatsApp showing people how to update their health status on MySejahtera.Comm Mior Faridalathrash said the people need not worry about police enforcement efforts.“Each action by the police will be referred to the regulations. The people are advised to give their cooperation and be patient with the relevant agencies during the movement control order.“We will also not hesitate to take stern action against those who disobey the law and the standard operating procedure, ” he added.State Health director Datuk Dr Ding Lay Ming said only workers at factories that had Covid-19 cases need to declare their health status daily on MySejahtera as it is part of the manufacturing sector’s SOP.She said this was part of the SOP to manage premises where infections had been detected.“It’s listed under the positive case management topic (of the National Security Council’s SOP), ” she added.Meanwhile, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said while it may not be an offence not to update ones health status on the app, it’s good practice to do so.“This is because the application was created by the government to assist in controlling the spread of infection and to allow users to perform self health evaluations.“As such, the application is not just used to scan codes so that we can enter a place. Also important is that the status be updated constantly, depending on our daily activities, ” he said in his daily statement yesterday.Noting the confusion which led to compounds being issued, Ismail Sabri urged all enforcement agents to not misinterpret the SOPs.“I also hope and urge any such compounds issued to be canceled.“Any misunderstanding and confusion that has arisen must be rectified and improved upon, and I urge understanding from all sides so that we can work together in flattening the curve of infection, ” he said."
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,News,CLARISSA CHUNG,Cases going down to below R1,"PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is seeing a dip in the Covid-19 infectivity rate. Though this is encouraging, health experts caution the public against taking their foot off the pedal.Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman said the downward trend proved that the preventive measures put in place were effective.“Our steps to control the outbreak are on track but we have to continue this effort to reduce it further.“It is a good sign, but if we loosen our grip, the number of infections is set to potentially increase, ” she said.Dr Malina added that while the country’s R value was showing a decline, the aim would be to push it down to near zero.The R value, or reproduction number, refers to the infectivity rate of a virus at a particular point in time.It represents the average number of people an infected person could spread the disease to, so an R value of lower than 1 means that the number of people being infected on average will be fewer over time.Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the R value had dropped to below 1 during the first week of the lockdown.Yesterday, it was recorded at 0.99.On May 31, before the two-week lockdown was implemented, it was 1.09.Previously, the R value was also recorded at levels of 1.21 and 1.16, on May 23 and May 29, respectively. International Islamic University Malaysia epidemiologist Prof Dr Jamalludin Ab Rahman said while the R value did show a positive impact, it was not enough.Malaysia was not out of the woods yet, he said.“R alone is not enough. For example, we should look at fatality rates, or the number of new clusters.“Should we be happy with an R value that is lower than 1?“Yes. But is the effort enough? Not yet, ” Dr Jamalludin pointed out.“The R value has to be persistently low. Until when? There is no precise answer.”He said that while the MCO and lockdown had reduced mobility among the general population considerably, Malaysia was still seeing transmissions in factories.“The government really needs to settle this source of infections.“The movement control order can solve sporadic cases in the community but if factories are still operating and close contact in crowded spaces is not being controlled, we will continue to have cases from factories, ” he added.Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Azmi Mohd Tamil agreed.He said that unless a relational database – where all secondary cases were mapped out to each primary case – it would not be possible to get the accurate average number of secondary persons infected from a single primary case.“What we have is only an estimate based on a mathematical model.“As long as we have cases in the community, the outbreak will continue – until the majority of the population is immune to the disease.”At present, Dr Azmi said, “all possible cases of Covid-19 need to be screened, identified and isolated from the susceptible population”.He reckoned that the lockdown should not be lifted on June 14.“The number of cases does not support that – even though the R value is currently below 1, ” he added."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",4:32 AM MYT,News,SHARON BERNSTEIN,Carbon dioxide in the air at highest level since measurements began,"(Reuters) - Despite a massive reduction in commuting and in many commercial activities during the early months of the pandemic, the amount of carbon in Earth's atmosphere in May reached its highest level in modern history, a global indicator released on Monday showed.Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California San Diego, said the findings, based on the amount of carbon dioxide in the air at NOAA's weather station on Mauna Loa in Hawaii, was the highest since measurements began 63 years ago.The measurement, called the Keeling Curve after Charles David Keeling, the scientist who began tracking carbon dioxide there in 1958, is a global benchmark for atmospheric carbon levels.Instruments perched on NOAA's mountaintop observatory recorded carbon dioxide at about 419 parts per million last month, more than the 417 parts per million in May 2020.Because carbon dioxide is a key driver of climate change, the findings show that reducing the use of fossil fuels, deforestation and other practices that lead to carbon emissions must be a top priority to avoid catastrophic consequences, Pieter Tans, a scientist with NOAA's Global Monitoring Laboratory, said in a report on the emissions.“We are adding roughly 40 billion metric tons of CO2 pollution to the atmosphere per year,” Tans wrote. “That is a mountain of carbon that we dig up out of the Earth, burn, and release into the atmosphere as CO2 - year after year.""The amount of carbon in the air now is as much as it was about 4 million years ago, a time when sea level was 78 feet (24 meters) higher than it is today and the average temperature was 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than it was before the Industrial Revolution, the report said.Despite the pandemic lockdown, scientists were not able to see a drop in the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere partly because of wildfires, which also release carbon, as well as the natural behavior of carbon in the atmosphere, the report said.The carbon dioxide levels measured were not affected by the eruption of Hawaiian volcanoes, Tans said, adding the station is situated far enough from active volcanoes that measurements are not distorted, and occasional plumes of carbon dioxide are removed from the data.(Reporting by Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento, California; Editing by Howard Goller)"

""We can now see the light at the end of the tunnel as vaccine shipments have started to arrive in bulks,"" he added.Since the start of the vaccination drive on March 1, the Philippines has administered nearly 6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines primarily to frontline healthcare workers, the elderly, among others.The government aims to inoculate 70 million people this year, and more than 1.5 million have been fully vaccinated so far.On Monday, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire urged people at high risks such as healthcare workers and the elderly to get the jabs.She also urged people to avoid ""super spreader"" gatherings such as parties and to wear a face covering and keep a safe distance when outside.""We urge the public to stay home and go out only when needed to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and prevent another case surge,"" Vergeire added. - Xinhua"
"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",6:58 PM MYT,Asean+,RAQUEL CARVALHO,"Abuse and anger: inside the online groups spreading stolen, sexual images of women and children","This is the second in a series of stories on image-based abuse supported by the Judith Neilson Institute’s Asian Stories project, in collaboration with The Korea Times, Indonesia’s Tempo magazine, the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, and Manila-based ABS-CBN. Sonia Sarkar, Tashny Sukumaran and Lee Min-young contributed reporting. The piece contains descriptions of a sexual nature.Amala*, 22, from Malaysia, recalls the day it felt like her mobile phone would never stop lighting up with Instagram follow requests from men.“My stomach instantly dropped when I realised what was going on, ” she said. A male friend later told her that her Instagram posts and username had been shared with some 40,000 members of the Telegram channel V2K.“I felt nauseated and pretty much clueless, like every other person who has been in this situation, ” Amala said.V2K – which was last year denounced by women on social media, who also reported it to the Malaysian authorities – is one of hundreds of groups that have sprung up on chat apps such as Telegram.The encrypted messaging platform, which has half a billion users, gained popularity amid a drive to protect user data from governments – but it has also come under increasing scrutiny for being used to share illegal and abusive content.This Week in Asia analysed hundreds of posts on Telegram groups, where images of children as well as non-consensual content involving women have proliferated, while also looking into cases of pictures and videos shared by schoolboys on social networks such as Instagram.Faced with a slow response from the platforms and the police, some women – and a few men – are taking the issue into their own hands by infiltrating these groups and assisting the authorities in their investigations.CHILD ABUSESet up by self-exiled Russian brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov in 2013, Telegram allows users to exchange messages and reach a wide audience through groups called “channels”. It has become the app of choice for protest movements in places such as Hong Kong, where activists and others use it to organise demonstrations and share news while avoiding censorship and ensuring privacy.However, Telegram has also been criticised for allowing the proliferation of malicious activity such as terrorism, rampant misogyny, and other forms of abuse in its chat rooms.Two Italian scholars, Silvia Semenzin and Lucia Bainotti, found that the sense of anonymity provided by the platform, its weak regulation, and the ability to create large male communities had contributed “to the reinstatement of hegemonic masculinity”.This Week in Asia reviewed more than 20 channels – some of them extremely graphic and involving the online sexual exploitation of children. Many of these groups can easily be found by searching keywords on the Telegram app as well as through invitation links, and their content can often be accessed without even having to join the groups.These channels not only re-shared screenshots of photos and videos from social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, but also nude pictures and messages that had been sent privately; home-made sex videos, some of which were taken without consent; and photos of sleeping women.The personal information of women and girls – including their social media handles, phone numbers, and even home addresses – had also been published.In a Telegram channel named “Gadis Melayu” – or “Malay Girl” – we found dozens of posts with pictures of children’s faces and bodies, as well as images of women that appeared to have been posted without their consent. By early June the channel – identified in the invite link as “melayutop” – had more than 2,800 members, and displayed more than 1,500 photos and 915 videos.Several posts showed screenshots of entire galleries of images and videos involving children, with one of the holders of this illegal content described as a“trusted dealer”. At least 20 other posts were even more graphic, showing girls and boys engaging in sexual acts with adults.Bahasa Malaysia was often used in chats and some payments were requested in ringgit, though Indonesian children were specifically mentioned in the written description of at least two of the messages we reviewed.We reported the channel to Telegram for child abuse on May 7, but no action had been taken as of publication time. In fact, more posts with such content have been shared in recent weeks.On May 11, for instance, another collection of photos and videos of children was promoted in the channel, with prices and contacts for those who wanted access to it. The same day, a video of an Asian girl exposing her genitals was posted in the group.More recently, another user wrote: “I just want links to sex videos of little boys and girls.” There were also messages that referred to a “pedomom” – an allusion to a mother’s involvement in pedophilic content.In countries such as the Philippines, where millions of families lost their income during the Covid-19 pandemic, more parents are turning to selling their children online for sexual exploitation.We also filed a report to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which is responsible for finding and removing images and videos of child sexual abuse from the internet. Its response was swift, but its hands were tied.“We are aware of many file sharing programmes available and that they are open to abuse, ” the Britain-based charity wrote in a May 13 email, four days after our report.“The services are based on a peer-to-peer system, without any ISP-hosted content, ” the IWF added, referring to internet service providers in a specific geographic location. The foundation does not have the authority to investigate individual internet users and the content of their hard drives.“This is currently under the sole remit of the police, ” it said. “We can only investigate content that is hosted in the public domain.”Nevertheless, the IWF processed a record 299,600 reports of child sexual abuse imagery last year, including tipoffs from members of the public – close to 40,000 more reports than in 2019.The charity has also seen a staggering 77 per cent increase in the amount of “self-generated” abuse material, as more children and criminals spend longer online amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Content of this nature includes child sexual abuse captured by webcams, often in the child’s own room. In some instances, the foundation said, children are groomed, deceived or extorted into producing and sharing a sexual image or video of themselves.Experts note that there is still limited research on child online safety in the Asia-Pacific region, with many countries still failing to provide sex education.UNDER THE RADARWhile some Telegram channels are more focused on explicit content, others share images portraying women in everyday situations such as having fun with their friends at beaches or swimming pools, and working out at the gym – albeit often without their knowledge and consent.In a group named “SG Sports Bra Babes”, a post read: “Hi everyone, if you’re going to submit pics, please crop out the Instagram slide numbers or tagged icon. You can wait for about two seconds before screenshotting and the icons will fade away.”This suggests that the photos – and some videos – are screenshots from social media accounts, rather than being shared by the women themselves. The channel, which was set up in February, had 179 subscribers at the end of last month, but some posts had more than 1,000 views.In another message from March, the administrator decided to run an anonymous poll, which asked users: “Planning on starting a SG Bikini Channel, anyone up?”On a channel called “Mysggirls”, with more than 4,000 subscribers, there were photos and videos of girls, including some in school uniform. Upskirting videos had also been uploaded, and the administrator wrote in January that people who felt offended should leave the group rather than reporting it.Those who set up such channels on Telegram, and many of their members, are often aware they are being monitored. Some even teach subscribers how to evade authorities and activists.In a private group called “Love United”, which is believed to be based in Singapore, an active user with the handle “Just Siew Mai” warned others about the risks in late March.“Stay here but keep no traces of your online identity. Change your DP [profile picture], your username and most importantly, don’t get too attached to your Telegram stuff. Be ready to delete your Telegram account at a moment’s notice. That’s how we combat those white knights, ” the user said. “What we are doing is lawfully wrong already, so we must do it smartly in order not to get caught.”Just Siew Mai also told others not to worry if activists had exposed the group on Twitter, adding: “Make sure your online identity and character is totally different from your real life persona.”The user later deleted these messages.On “Vitamin4Testicles” – a channel in which more than 19,000 members shared over 15,000 photos and 6,000 videos, mostly of women from Malaysia – there were frequent requests for leaks about specific women. Some also openly offered and sold images of their ex-girlfriends.“If your friend’s photo is in [the] group then it’s already with many people, ” a user wrote on May 13. “Something [that] is online is always online. You are here to watch nudes, just accept it.”There are even users who warned others not to post content about a specific woman after realising she had filed a police report.While some channels are public, other rooms are private – and access to those has varying requirements, including payments in cryptocurrency, or photos of the users’ genitals and faces.Telegram seems to be actively preventing users from accessing some of these groups, but only through iPhones. For instance, when we tried to join “Sg Nasi Lemak Official”, a Singapore-based channel created on November 26, a warning appeared on an iPhone: “This channel can’t be displayed because it was used to spread pornographic content.”But the group, which has more than 5,000 subscribers, was still accessible on Android devices – which have Google-developed operating systems – and Telegram’s Mac application.“If you download the app directly from the Internet [instead of through] the App Store, you are still able to see banned conversations which are hidden on iPhones. Interestingly, the only reason Telegram bans this kind of group is because they do not want to be removed from the App Store – which criminalises pornographic content, ” said Italian researcher Semenzin, a lecturer in new media and digital culture at the University of Amsterdam.David Thiel, Big Data Architect and Chief Technology Officer of the Stanford Internet Observatory, said despite the public’s general impression, “Telegram is not, broadly speaking, an encrypted messaging app”.“Group chats are unencrypted, and one-to-one chats are unencrypted by default, ” he said, adding that this meant “Telegram has access to the content of the chat, so it could be identifying adult content itself, or relying on user reports against particular groups”.Thiel, who previously worked for Facebook, said rather than companies such as Apple pushing apps on its platform to crack down on this content, a better solution would be Telegram implementing controls on material showing the sexual abuse of children as well as non-consensual intimate imagery across all platforms.“I personally think this should be a cross-industry collaborative effort, ” he said.Apple and Google did not respond to questions from This Week in Asia.One of the most surprising things about the Sg Nasi Lemak Official channel – also known as “Sg Nsl Official” – is that it resembles another group that was previously investigated by the Singaporean authorities.In October 2019, four men were arrested and later pleaded guilty for their involvement in the channel “SG Nasi Lemak”, which mainly displayed videos and pictures of Singaporean women to its 44,000 members.The channel’s 39-year-old co-administrator was this year sentenced to nine weeks’ jail as well as a fine of S$26,000 (US$19,550). Two others, aged 20 and 18, were placed on probation for distributing obscene material, while a 27-year-old man, another administrator, was sentenced to a year of mandatory psychiatric treatment.But these penalties do not seem to have served as a deterrent to those operating and sharing this content.The new Sg Nasi Lemak Official channel was recently used to promote “premium content” in a separate group, subscriptions for which varied from S$88 for a month to S$850 for a year. The payments, they said, should be made using bitcoin.The teasers clearly stated that at least part of the shared content was non-consensual. Several posts promised there would be new videos released daily and that private information – such as Instagram accounts and names – would be leaked.LENDING AN EARNisha Rai, a 21-year-old university student from Singapore, in March joined about 20 young women and men who monitor online chat rooms for illegal and non-consensual content. She now spends most of her spare time reaching out to girls and women who have had their images or videos leaked, while compiling lists of these groups’ administrators and active members.Over the past three months, she has sifted through some 70 channels and contacted dozens of women.“What we do on our end is to encourage [survivors] to lodge a police report, especially if they know who they sent [pictures] to or if they know who’s the one who leaked the videos, ” Rai said.But more than anything else, she said, her group existed to lend an ear to those affected. “Sometimes you just want to know that somebody’s there ... We can talk to them and direct them to other organisations that can provide them with professional help should they need it, ” she said, noting that the members of her group did not have formal training in this regard.Rai said the non-consensual sharing of images had become “a huge concern” for young women such as her.“I am someone who is an avid user of social media ... At times, when I get an influx of messages or a sudden surge of follower requests on Instagram, I start to wonder if someone had screenshotted my picture and sent it out in the groups, ” she said.Rai, who has also helped launch an Instagram support page for survivors, worries about the different forms of harassment and trauma that can be caused by image-based abuse. “At the end of the day, when such images get shared and sent out, our physical and online safety is immediately at risk, ” she said.Some men are also lending a hand in the fight. Raakesh Sivapalan, 23, a material handler at a company in Singapore, joined Rai’s team this year after a conversation with his fiancée about such Telegram groups.Sivapalan said he had helped by compiling resources available to survivors and offering advice on how to navigate the Singaporean legal system.He is currently undercover in about five groups – some with 3,000 to 4,000 members – to collect information.“I am not only frustrated, I am also very angry. As a man, I feel that this is so wrong, ” he said, referring to those who shared photos of women without their consent. “If someone breaks up with you, you must show character and dignity instead of chasing the girl in this way.”He said he had encountered men seeking to embarrass former partners, but there were also men who turned to these groups for personal pleasure. “It’s content that is easily available, ” he said.Sivapalan, who witnessed a case of intimate image abuse in his personal circle, said he had come across too many upsetting posts – some of them involving children. He is now focused on understanding how transactions of this sort of content take place, and whenever possible he takes the cases to the authorities.“I feel like I need to stand up, as a man, ” he said. “These men need to understand that women shouldn’t be treated this way. They should think that they too can be affected, their sisters, their cousins ... they too can be targets.”A study focused on Australia, New Zealand and Britain, published last year, found that one in five men had reported having engaged in one or more forms of image-based abuse.Those who shared and/or threatened to share nude or sexual images – most commonly men under 40 years old – said they had done it mostly for fun, and to flirt or be sexy. According to the study – which was conducted by four scholars, including Anastasia Powell, lecturer in justice and legal studies at RMIT University in Australia – their other motivations included wanting to impress friends, for financial gain, to obtain more images, or for revenge on or to control a former partner.“These findings show a range of diverse motivations for engaging in image-based sexual abuse, ” the study said. “In some cases, perpetrators reported motivations which appeared to be less about personally targeting a specific victim and more about their own capacity to either make money or gain status.”The report also suggested that those engaging in these behaviours might not fully understand or even give much thought to the potential impact on survivors. “Importantly, there appears to be a tendency among perpetrators not to recognise image-based sexual abuse as harmful, ” the study said.Shailey Hingorani, head of research and advocacy for the Singapore-based non-profit Aware, said “for the sake of a perpetrator’s momentary pleasure or spite, a survivor may live with anxiety for the rest of her life”.She pointed out that much like all forms of gender-based abuse, tech-facilitated sexual violence was about power and control, and the disregard of women’s consent and agency.“The ease at which men can now capture, disseminate and watch voyeuristic videos seems to have further normalised the practice, and accelerated the rate at which female bodies are reduced to commodities for male consumption, ” Hingorani said, noting that perpetrators were rarely held accountable.“We even know that men explicitly encourage each other to commit these acts over and over. So it is entirely unsurprising to see our case numbers going up. The trend is likely to continue.”The government of Singapore earlier this year said it was working to set up a new alliance focused on tackling online harms, especially those targeting women. It also said new laws could be introduced to tackle issues that included the dissemination of voyeuristic material and non-consensual intimate images.RAPE CULTUREHowever, there is a widespread belief that policies and laws have been too slow in catching up with perpetrators and the growth of technology. Non-consensual images have ended up not only in mainstream social media and chat apps, but also in more niche messaging platforms such as Discord, which is widely used by gamers.Against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement, which has seen women around the world push for accountability for sexual misconduct, an increasing number of survivors have come forward.Soma Sara, who studied in Britain, last year set up a website called Everyone’s Invited, which has turned into part of the movement against rape culture. It has compiled thousands of testimonies from survivors of abuse, including non-consensual sharing of intimate images, many from students who attended private schools in England.There are accounts of how some students set up groups on social media and chatting apps in which photos of girls were traded. But when these cases were reported to schools, few acted on behalf of the targets and most perpetrators faced few consequences, multiple statements said.“Boys had group chats where they would ridicule and spread multiple photos of naked girls online. The school found out but barely punished them, ” read one testimony, which mentioned a top British school.In India, the authorities last year cracked down on an Instagram group chat in which 27 teenagers from New Delhi’s top schools shared images of 15 underage girls, along with lewd comments about them. This came after leaked screenshots of the group went viral on platforms such as WhatsApp and Twitter.Shubham Singh – the founder of Cyber World Academy, a portal that offers online courses in ethical hacking – was one of the first cybercrime experts to come across the private chat, which was called “Bois Locker Room”.At least two survivors had approached Singh to seek the removal of their images from the group, as they feared that filing police complaints would draw further attention to them.“One of the victims told me that her image was morphed and shared in the group, ” Singh said. “In another case, a male member of the group had shared nude images of his ex-girlfriend, which she had privately shared with him when they were seeing each other. The victim said her ex-boyfriend had already threatened to release these photos on social media when she broke up with him.”During his investigations, Singh discovered other private chat groups with similar content, including one called “Wall of Shame”. He said he encountered at least 30 cases of cyberbullying every day.“Bullying has always been common among teenagers in physical space. In cyberspace, bullying takes the form of sexual bullying as people think that this is a private group and nobody is watching, ” he said, noting that many saw it as a form of entertainment.A 19-year-old Delhi college student, who claimed he was privy to Bois Locker Room chats through one of its members, said most of the discussions in the group were about sexual expectations that the boys had from girls.He admitted that some of the members had shared pictures of minors without their consent, and that there were also morphed images of a girl.“Some of the members objected to it too, my friend told me, ” he said, though he maintained that “none of them wanted to rape girls in real life” and that some in the group were only “silent members”.Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of the New Delhi police’s cybercrime unit, who investigated the case, said the group's adult administrator had been arrested and charged, but he was out on bail before the trial. A teenager who was detained had been released last year, he added.He said devices belonging to members of the group, primarily mobile phones, had been sent to a forensic lab for investigation.“We are waiting for the forensic results, ” Roy said. “Not everyone may have engaged in offensive and unlawful activity in the group ... If anything incriminating comes against the other members, we will take action against them.”‘IT’S NOT JUST SOME LOSERS’The issue of image-based abuse has become increasingly prominent in South Korea, which has been rocked by a wave of online sexual abuse cases, some involving K-pop stars and actors.In 2018, tens of thousands of women joined protests in Seoul, holding up signs that read “my life is not your porn” while calling out the watching and taking of non-consensual videos as well as the country’s patriarchal culture.A number of porn sites and online file-sharing drives have been shut down in South Korea due to public pressure and heightened scrutiny, but encrypted chat rooms with foreign servers have gained popularity as alternatives.Following a national outcry, South Korean authorities last year took the unusual step of publicly identifying a then 24-year-old as the leader of an online sexual blackmail ring involving Telegram channels. Cho Ju-bin was behind chat rooms that profited from victims, many of them underage girls, by blackmailing them into sharing degrading and violent sexual imagery of themselves.Cho was sentenced to 45 years in prison, while Moon Hyung-wook, another major player in the case, received a 34-year sentence. Related trials are still ongoing.Two female university students in South Korea, who call themselves Team Flame, were the first to investigate these groups. Although their work eventually led to police investigations into the case, with users trying to lay low amid a recent spate of arrests, the illegal channels are no closer to disappearing.“We don’t think it is over because we still monitor the chat rooms, and there are still rooms with thousands or tens of thousands of people, and illegally filmed videos and sexually exploitative content are still shared there, ” said Bul*, one of the young journalists. “They say in the rooms, ‘Let’s resume when things get quiet’. So we deeply feel we should keep an eye on them and punish them.”One still-active channel is dedicated to “acquaintance insulting”. “Perpetrators make composite photos by adding the faces of their classmates or even their families, such as mothers or sisters ... to sexual, erotic photos, ” said Dan*, the other member of Team Flame.In addition to morphing the pictures, those in the channel write vulgar and sexually insulting comments under the photos, and even share the personal information of some targets.Bul and Dan have also monitored Chinese-language groups in which content produced in South Korea and China is shared.“We are currently in four rooms that use Chinese, and one of them has more than 30,000 members, ” Dan said, arguing that China should step up its efforts to tackle online sexual abuse.Bul said their work had revealed the sheer scale of the issue. “People generally think this is limited only to some losers and it has nothing to do with them. But we learned that so many people around us are exposed to and are engaging in this act of sharing sexually exploitative content.”In Malaysia, a managing member of the feminist collective CybHer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said those who had gone undercover to investigate these groups faced great risks. But on top of being the targets of doxxing and cyberbullying, she said one of the most difficult things to deal with “was realising that your own boyfriend, father, brother, relatives and friends were in the groups, and most often were sharing pictures – often nudes – of their friends”.After the Malaysian authorities cracked down on some groups late last year, most of them went quiet, much like in South Korea. But it did not take long before backup groups and new channels sprang up.This means organisations such as CybHer – which was set up primarily to offer support and help to the affected women – are sorely needed.“Currently, infiltrating the groups enables us to help our friends and other women who are afraid that their pictures are possibly being shared in these groups, ” said the managing member.There are also reports that images with faces of women superimposed on nude bodies were being widely shared in Telegram channels such as Vitamin4Testicles.“What we can learn from this is that there needs to be constant monitoring, ” said Nicole Jo Pereira, a community development executive with the Make It Right Movement at Brickfields Asia College.The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission did not respond to queries about investigations into the V2k channel and other groups, nor did the police.‘THE EXTRA MILE’Pereira is among the advocates who argue that social media companies should do more to screen the content available on their platforms.In January, she was asked to assist in a report made about a Facebook account that was stealing and screenshotting images of women, as well as impersonating them.“While numerous reports were made, nothing has been done to remove the account to date. When faced with the issue of circulation of nude images, time is of the essence and a delay in taking immediate action is dangerous, ” Pereira said, noting that it exposed the victims to further harassment, humiliation, and risks of suicide.A spokesperson for Facebook – which owns Instagram and WhatsApp – said the company had “zero tolerance for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, or threats to share those images without permission”.She said artificial intelligence was used to detect this sort of content before it was reported, and added that Facebook had specially trained teams that quickly removed pictures or videos once they had been reported.“We are also able to use photo-matching technology to prevent those images from ever being re-shared on our platforms in the future, ” the spokesperson said.Facebook removed more than 28 million pieces of content showing adult nudity and sexual activity between October and December last year, while Instagram took down more than 11 million during the same period. Most of it was removed before users reported it, according to the spokesperson.Clare McGlynn QC, professor of law at Durham University in Britain, said social media companies such as Facebook and TikTok had begun to take action against intimate image abuse.“[But] we must keep up the pressure for them to respond to victims. We must hold them at their word and try to eliminate this material from their platforms, ” she said, noting that it was important to invest further resources in developing the technology to track, trace and remove non-consensual material.Teeruvarasu Muthusamy, a lawyer based in Malaysia, said Telegram did not have adequate reporting mechanisms to tackle the dissemination of intimate content.“The anonymity provided by the application appears to make it the preferred social media platform for criminal activity. This is because a Telegram user can hide his phone number and still send messages, images or videos, ” he said.Telegram, which has its global development centre in Dubai but has servers all around the world, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Semenzin from the University of Amsterdam said banning pornography in general would not be an appropriate response.“The puritanical approach of digital platforms to pornography and sexuality is creating several issues of censorship for people who use social media for sex education, or discuss sexuality through a positive approach, ” she said. “What online platforms should do is take more responsibility for their role in mediating the spread of violence. [To platforms such as Telegram], online violence against women and girls is still not considered as urgent or a big issue, but just a side effect of staying online.”Semenzin said normalising pornography in society and educating people about sexuality could diminish online sexual violence. “The most effective way to face such issues is promoting cultural programmes with the aim of replacing rape culture with a culture of consent, ” she said.While Rai, the student activist from Singapore, has had discussions with other women on how to best protect themselves, she insists the perpetrators should be held accountable for their actions.“Some immediate responses include: ‘We should not post or send pictures because someone may misuse it’, ” she said. “But why is it that we are concerned that someone may misuse it? Shouldn’t it be basic respect to not share someone’s images? Why are we females conditioned to be conscious of what we send and why are we not expecting and teaching perpetrators to be respectful?”As part of her efforts, she decided to launch an online petition calling for the Singapore Police Force and State Courts to shut down Telegram channels that had been used to distribute non-consensual pictures, videos and personal information of women. By the end of May, it had garnered more than 2,000 signatures.“The sexualisation of women doesn’t look at their skin [or] what they wear, it’s blind to everything. There are pictures of women who are just going out, who are walking in the street, and yet their pictures are still shared in these groups, ” Rai said.Amala from Malaysia, whose images were shared on Telegram, also feels that the authorities and platforms are not doing enough to help survivors such as herself.“Deep down I know nothing will happen.

Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who made a three-hour stop in Taiwan with fellow Democrat Christopher Coons of Delaware and Republican Dan Sullivan of Alaska, said their visit underscores bipartisan US backing for the democratic island. - AP"

They gave me so much energy. I want to say thank you to everyone.""Saso had held the 36-hole lead and started the day one shot off Thompson's lead. But she was in trouble early with double bogeys at the second and third.""I was actually upset,"" she said. ""My caddie talked to me, said there's still many holes to go -- just keep doing what I was doing the last few days and trust the process.""Saso was two-under the rest of the way, and had a long birdie putt to win at the 72nd hole. It didn't drop, but she rattled in the par putt to force the playoff.- Thompson collapse -Thompson, seeking a second career major to go with her 2014 ANA Inspiration title, was five strokes up on the front nine and remained four up with eight to play.A double bogey at 11 signalled the start of a slide and her bogey at 14 saw her lead down to two.Unable to take advantage of the par-five 16th, she missed a five-foot par putt at the par-five 17th to fall into a tie for first.At the 18th, Thompson was in the fairway but her approach found the front greenside bunker and she left a 10-foot putt to save par, and make the playoff, two feet short.""That's what this golf course can do to you,"" said Thompson of the imposing par-71 Lake Course at Olympic, which has hosted five men's US Opens but had never before hosted a women's major.She finished with a four-over par 75 that left her alone in third on 281.""And that's what I've said all week. Overall, I'd be the first one to tell you that I hit some bad golf shots (down the stretch) and I deserved it,"" Thompson added, ""but it's golf.""Hataoka seemed an unlikely title challenger as the day began. She was six shots off the lead and came within a whisker of completing the greatest final-round rally in US Women's Open history.She started with a birdie at the first, and rebounded from a double bogey at the sixth with birdies at the seventh and ninth.After a bogey at 11 had her seven shots off the pace, the 22-year-old birdied 13, 14 and 16 -- where she rolled in a breaking putt to pull within one.Two pars to finish made her the first in the clubhouse on 280, and it wasn't long until she was joined there by Saso.It was Hataoka's fourth LPGA tour playoff and her second in a major, but in each one she has come up empty.""On the first (major championship) playoff I had to wait over an hour, so I was kind of excited,"" Hataoka said of her near-miss at the 2018 Women's PGA Championship. ""It got me all excited and uptight.""But this one since it was right away, I decided I would just be relaxed, then just keep doing what I'm supposed to be doing, and this was the result."" - AFP"

It will commercially launch Russia's Sputnik V shots this month.Modi said the government would allow private hospitals to have 25% of all vaccine supplies but not to charge more than 150 rupees ($2.06) over the cost of the dose.The new policy should help move things faster, an expert said.""This (centralised inoculation policy) eliminates states having to compete with one another for vaccine supplies, leaving them to concentrate on distributing them rapidly to their populations,"" Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University in Delhi, said.Overnight, India reported 100,636 new infections, the lowest in the world's second-most populous nation since April 6, and well off last month's peaks of more than 400,000, allowing authorities to re-open parts of the economy.The financial hub of Mumbai and capital city of Delhi allowed private businesses to bring back 50% of their staff to workplaces and partially resumed public transport.(Reporting by Neha Arora in New Delhi and Shilpa Jamkhandikar in Mumbai; Additional reporting by Manas Mishra, Rajendra Jadhav and Bhargav Acharya;Editing by Sanjeev Miglani, Clarence Fernandez and Nick Macfie)"

The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump in December 2019, but he was acquitted by the then-Republican-dominated Senate early in 2020.Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden, a Democrat, and left office in January 2021.In April, federal prosecutors investigating Giuliani's business dealings in Ukraine at the time he was serving as Trump's lawyer raided his home and office, seizing cell phones and computers.Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, has not been charged. He said after the raids that his conduct had been ""absolutely legal and ethical.""Giuliani began representing Trump in April 2018 in connection with then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.(Reporting by Mohammad Zargham; Editing by Stephen Coates)"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,EUGENE MAHALINGAM,Bolstering vehicle sales,"PETALING JAYA: The recently extended vehicle sales tax holiday is a timely move, as it will help boost sales and absorb the impact of the multiple lockdowns imposed this year.An analyst with a local bank-backed brokerage said the sales tax exemption will especially help bolster the sales of local car manufacturers, considering the current economic uncertainties.“The ongoing pandemic has created plenty of uncertainty and many customers, in the spirit of wanting to remain cautious, will downgrade to cheaper, more fuel-efficient vehicles.“We believe the tax exemption will bolster interests in passenger vehicles, especially Proton and Perodua.”Maybank Investment Bank Research (Maybank IB), meanwhile, said it is positive but “not entirely surprised” about the vehicle tax holiday extension.“Various bodies, including the Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA), have been a strong advocate for this extension.“This leeway helps to absorb much of the sales and production disruptions (especially in June 2021, which would likely mirror the poor performance in April 2020), due to the multiple lockdowns/movement control orders (MCOs) and global chips shortage during this period, ” it said in a report.Maybank IB said its 2021 total industry volume (TIV) estimate of 600,000 units remained unchanged for now, with January-to-April 2021 vehicle sales of 199,556 units falling within expectations.“We expect stronger May 2021 figures but June will be much weaker due to the lockdown.“Otherwise, we still await the government to roll out the much anticipated but delayed electric vehicle policy, which is expected to be announced in June or July this year.”The vehicle sales tax exemption was announced in June 2020 under the short-term economic recovery plan (Penjana) and was supposed to last until the end of last year.However, it has since been extended twice: initially until the end of this month and recently, to the end of this year.Under the initiative, locally-assembled cars are fully-exempted from sales tax while for imported cars, the sales tax has been reduced from 10% to 5%.MIDF Research also said the tax holiday extension is a welcomed move, given the constraints faced by automotive players during the first half of this year.“The tax holiday period during the first half of 2021 was affected by production constraints, while June deliveries would have been impacted given the full lockdown implementation from June 1,2021, whereby auto vehicle and component manufacturing facilities are only allowed to operate at 10% workforce capacity.“As players still have up to four months of order backlog to deliver, the tax holiday extension serves both to provide the needed room to accommodate these deliveries and to boost bookings further post-lockdown period.”On the outlook for the remainder of the third quarter, or the final quarter of this year, an industry observer said much will depend on how soon the Covid-19 situation in the country can be brought under control.“The sooner the number of daily infections can be brought down to levels where the lockdown can be lifted, things will definitely pick up not just for the economy but also for the local automotive sector.“The performance of the local automotive industry is directly linked to the state of the economy.”He added that the nationwide vaccination rollout programme is key to bringing the number of Covid-19 cases down.“The sooner it can be done, the better. This is important in improving buyer sentiment. The current uncertainty in the market is causing many potential buyers to hold back purchases and adopt a wait-and-see attitude, ” he said.Meanwhile, Kenanga Research in a recent report said it expects the current hiccup in sales of the older models from the global chip shortage to be offset by sufficient supply for the newer models, which garner better margins.“We believe the new volume-driven launches (such as the Perodua Ativa(pic below), Proton X50, Honda City and Nissan Almera) could help spur sales along with overflowing backlogged bookings and further boosted by the extension of the sales tax holiday, seasonal promotions and more new launches expected in the second half of the year.“Overall, 2021 could potentially be a better year with the National Automotive Policy 2020 incentive programme, positive impact from Bank Negara’s interest rate cut and preemptive measures that soften the Covid-19 impact.”PublicInvest Research also believes that the extension of the tax holiday will mitigate the impact of the MCO.“In a surprise announcement, the government announced there will be a (two-weeks) phase one total lockdown for all economic and social sector activities except for essential economic and service sectors, followed by a second phase that extends for another four weeks, which will see a gradual re-opening of some sectors.”As a result, the research house noted that all showrooms, vehicle productions and deliveries are to be temporarily closed during phase one, except service centres where everything will be by appointment only.“Thus we expect close to zero sales for June 2021 if phase one were to last for a month.“Nevertheless, the impact of the lockdown is likely to be mitigated by the government’s extension of the current sales tax exemption to Dec 31,2021, which could lead to stronger vehicle sales volume in the second half of 2021, ” it said.According to data by the Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA), total vehicle sales in Malaysia surged to 57,912 units in April this year, as sales in the previous corresponding period were drastically affected by the implementation of the MCO.Only a total of 152 vehicles were registered in April 2020.Year-to-date April 2021, total vehicle sales were up 89% to 199,556 units from 105,424 units.For this year, MAA projects TIV to grow 8% to 570,000, on the back of the renewed sales tax exemption and stronger economic recovery.The MAA is scheduled to have its second bi-annual meeting next month, where it will announce whether it will be maintaining or revising its 2021 vehicle sales forecast."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,DALJIT DHESI,Opportunities in alternative investments,"PETALING JAYA: Alternative investments are gaining traction in Asean and Malaysia is set to be one of the beneficiaries in the region for such investments.Based on global statistics, it is expected to touch US$17 trillion (RM70.18 trillion) by 2023, an increase of 21% from the current level of US$14 trillion (RM57.79 trillion) in assets under management.Juwai IQI chief economist Shan Saeed (pic, below) told StarBiz that alternative investments have become a major component in the wealth management industry in Asean.“From my talks at various wealth management forums, I realised that alternative investments will become a major focus of attention in Asia by big players in the market.“Alternative investments are those assets which are under-marketed unlike other asset classes but these investments hold value and returns for sophisticated and smart investors, ” he said.According to Shan, such investments include private equity (PE), real estate, hedge funds, arts, luxury goods, farmland and vineyards.The industry, he said, is growing at a fast pace. By 2020, alternative assets have grown to US$14 trillion (RM57.79 trillion) due to low interest rates from global central banks and high interest from big investors in the financial markets.For example, Harvard University endowment has taken position in arts, allocating US$14.2bil (RM58.62bil), and in farmland in New Zealand in 2003.This reflects that big players are getting serious about the alternative investment market which is providing them solid returns, Shan added.Harvard endowment is the largest academic endowment in the world with an endowment size of US$40bil (RM165.12bil). Endowment is a big business in the United States and is valued at around US$500bil to US$800bil (RM2.06 trillion to RM3.30 trillion).He foresees more big players like hedge funds and pension funds entering the market to leverage from solid returns. These players would change the landscape and transform the market into rapid enhancement of wealth management and growth-driven market, he noted.In Malaysia, Shan said alternative investments are growing as more investors are getting exposure, knowledge, insights and market intelligence recognition for such investments.“The size of the market in the country could be small at the moment but is expected to grow between 7% and 10% in the next five years“The average return can vary from asset class to asset class. For example, arts can provide returns from 15% to 35% for established paintings like Andy Warhol’s, Van Gogh, Claude Monet or Picasso. Harvard endowment has taken a position in arts as well.”Shan said contemporary art prices have outperformed S&P by 172% for the period 1995-2020. This clearly demonstrates the interest in arts from big investors and its value-driven risk-reward ratio, he noted.“Samsung CEO recently sold his paintings at a sum of US$12bil (RM49.54bil) to pay off its tax bills. Agriculture farmland is another example whereby some PE groups are buying land in the US to make solid returns ranging from 8% to 12% with rising commodity prices, ” he added.Shan said Malaysia could become a potential alternative investment hub due to rising income levels and growing wealth of ultra high-net worth individuals who want to diversify into other asset classes.He added that the key to becoming a hub is to train and enhance the skillset of wealth advisers and planners to demonstrate the big picture to those sophisticated investors so as to broaden their investment landscape in the long run."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,GANESHWARAN KANA,Malaysia’s fundamentals still solid,"PETALING JAYA: The Malaysian economy is not out of the woods yet, but experts say the country remains supported by solid macroeconomic fundamentals.The fundamentals will help to put the economy back on track, once the Covid-19 pandemic is brought under control.Moody’s Investors Service said last week that the country has a diversified, competitive and moderately large economy, ample natural resources and strong medium-term growth prospects.The country’s large pool of domestic savings also supported the high government debt burden and lowers liquidity risk.Speaking with StarBiz, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid (pic, below) pointed out that Malaysia has a resilient banking system that is highly liquid and well-capitalised.“This has allowed more flexibility for Bank Negara to leverage on the strength of the banking institutions to complement the prevailing monetary policy stance, ” he said.The country enjoys the presence of strong institutional investors such as the Employers Provident Fund, the Retirement Fund Inc (KWAP), large insurance companies and asset management companies, according to Mohd Afzanizam.The presence of strong institutional investors will allow better absorption rate in the event of volatility in foreign capital flows.“In addition, the government debts have very little exposure to foreign currencies, with 97% of them being ringgit-denominated debts.“This would give the government the flexibility to raise more funds via the local capital markets as the credit risks are low. The government can always resort to increasing its funds and refinance existing borrowings, ” said Mohd Afzanizam.Meanwhile, MIDF Research economist Abdul Mui’zz Morhalim said Malaysia’s growth fundamentals would remain intact, especially after the current health crisis is brought under control.Being an exporting country, he told StarBiz that Malaysia would benefit from the recovery in global demand.“Despite the lockdown, we foresee Malaysia’s economic growth to be supported by the technology upcycle, as well as demand for commodity products such as rubber gloves, palm oil and crude oil.“On the back of growing international trade and recovery in demand from major trading partners like China and the United States, Malaysia is expected to continue recording a current account surplus, ” he said.In April 2021, Malaysia’s total trade recorded the strongest growth ever since 1998 with a surge of 43.2%, reaching RM190.8bil compared with RM133.2bil a year earlier.According to the Statistics Department, exports remained at a higher level, increasing by 63% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM105.6bil. Imports in April 2021 were valued at RM85.1bil and increased by 24.4% y-o-y.Trade balance continued to record a surplus with a value of RM20.5bil.Apart from the recovering global demand that boosts Malaysia’s exports, Abdul Mui’zz said the country would also benefit from the high commodity prices, especially crude oil and palm oil.Malaysia continues to be backed by its “stable and strong” banking system, despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. according to Abdul Mui’zz.“Stress tests conducted by Bank Negara showed Malaysian banking institutions are well-capitalised and able to withstand shocks to the economy.“Until now, we see banks continue to extend new lending and financing to the economy, supported by the currently accommodative monetary policy, ” he said.Moody’s Analytics, in a report issued yesterday, concurred that Malaysia’s exports are powering ahead, thanks to high commodity prices coupled with strong consumer tech demand.However, it pointed out that there are concerns about how much the domestic manufacturing sector and the country’s exports will be limited by capacity constraints introduced during the latest lockdown“Prior to the latest lockdown, the government pinned GDP growth at 6% to 7.5% in 2021. But there will be downward revisions announced in coming weeks.“Our baseline forecast assumes a 5.6% expansion in 2021, but there is added downside risk and heightened uncertainty.“The lockdown will disproportionately impact domestic demand, particularly household consumption given that only essential services are allowed to be in operation, ” it said.However, Moody’s Analytics opined that the latest fiscal stimulus should do the heavy lifting that guides the economy through this latest lockdown.On May 31, the government introduced a new stimulus package called Pemerkasa Plus worth RM40bil, equivalent to 2.7% of the gross domestic product to cushion the blow from the lockdown.The latest fiscal package is the third package to be introduced by the government this year and is double the RM20bil package announced in March.“The government is running out of fiscal space against rising debt obligations.“Prior to the latest stimulus package, the government estimated the fiscal deficit would hit 6% in 2021, unchanged from the deficit in 2020 and the largest since the financial crisis in 2009, ” according to the research firm.Moody’s Analytics added that Bank Negara has limited room to flex monetary muscle after substantial monetary easing in 2020.“We put odds of a 25-basis point rate cut in the third quarter at 70%, bringing the policy rate to 1.5%.“It is a potentially risky move with some chance of igniting capital outflows given higher US yields, ” it said."
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,,Getting a large share,"PETALING JAYA: Dagang Nexchange Bhd’s (DNeX) aim of increasing its stake in Ping Petroleum Ltd by 60% to 90% will enable the group to consolidate Ping’s contribution and exert more control over the company to access proven and probable oil and gas reserves.“The Anasuria cluster, which Ping has a 50% effective interest in, offers mature O&G (oil and gas) fields that entail production and development opportunities.“Once we increase our stake, our effective entitlement to the cluster leaps from 15% to 45%. With greater control, we are afforded the flexibility to unlock Ping’s long-term growth potential, ” said (DNeX) group managing director Datuk Seri Syed Zainal Abidin Syed Mohamed Tahir.Syed Zainal, in a reply to StarBiz, said DNex saw an opportunity of an attractive entry price with strong upside potential in increasing its stake in Ping.“Ping is stable, cash generating and profitable as well as has a strong track record and has been recording revenue and profit year-on-year for the past three financial years.“What is important to note is that Ping has been able to generate positive cash flow from its operations without having to rely on external borrowings, and has been in a net cash position for the past three fiscal years, ” he said.To fund the 60% stake buy, he said the group is looking at borrowings, some or all of which may be procured from Ping in the form of an inter-company loan.“The recently announced private placement will partially finance the proposed acquisition of Silterra. At the same time, it will also go to funding our Ping acquisition as the intention of the private placement is to fund any suitable and viable potential businesses or investments as well as our working capital requirements, ” Syed Zainal said.DNeX had said it would pay RM314mil for an additional 60% stake in Ping Petroleum Ltd to raise its stake in the oil and gas company to 90%.On its plans for Ping, Syed Zainal said Ping’s focus in the near term will be to unlock its untapped potential and maximise economic value from its asset portfolio.He said there was an opportunity to further improve Ping’s production output by rejuvenating existing wells to monetise economically attractive reserves in the Anasuria Cluster.“Moreover, as international O&G majors are divesting their upstream assets as part of their global portfolio rebalancing, we are also looking into acquiring additional late cycle producing assets in such target markets as the North Sea, Malaysia and within the region as well. “Opportunities are aplenty for us to embark on investments or acquisitions of late cycle producing brownfield assets in these regions, ” he said.Ping is said to have managed to keep and reduce operating costs to below US$20 (RM82) per barrel to ensure the company remains profitable and generates a positive operating cashflow despite the soft and volatile market conditions.Syed Zainal said the group was looking at potentially expanding into similar assets to the Anasuria cluster within the UK as well as in South-East Asia.“The O&G industry is also expected to face a major transition, with many major international O&G players expected to divest mature or late cycle oil assets as part of their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.“We see opportunities to acquire these quality assets in the near term to capitalise on improved oil prices once the global economy improves, ” he said.On the group’s plans for Silterra following winning the bid for the asset, Syed Zainal said immediate plans to drive Silterra’s transformation were to increase plant utilisation, undertake cost optimisation and expand market access.“These include initiatives to improve efficiencies and increase the company’s operational capacity as well as new capital investment to remove bottlenecks and improve plant utilisation, ” he said.“In addition, we will lead Silterra to ready market access including strategic customers and long-term supplier contracts by leveraging on the network of our partner.”He said also in the pipeline were the adoption of technology upgrades including micro-electromechanical system and silicon photonics, thus enabling change in product mix that can generate improved business margin.“The outlook of the semiconductor sector is expected to stay bullish with increasing demand continuing up to 2024, which can lead to sustainable positive earnings for Silterra and DNeX.“This makes the acquisition of Silterra timely and strategically compelling for DNeX. We are confident that our business in the semiconductor market will grow at a strong pace, ” he said.“We have set a two-year time frame to turn around Silterra and bring the company back to profitability.”Syed Zainal said when DNeX first ventured into the prospect of this acquisition, it was fortunate to land with a very experienced and likeminded partner in the form of Beijing Integrated Circuit Advanced Manufacturing and High-End Equipment Equity Investment Fund Centre (Limited Partnership) (CGP Fund).“CGP Fund was established as a private equity fund in 2014 focusing on the semiconductor industry in China. Meanwhile, Beijing CGP Investment Co Ltd (CGP), a private and independent investment management company, is the general partner and manager of CGP Fund which is principally operating based on market-oriented principles.“CGP has the experience in acquiring strategic assets, putting in the necessary resources, and successfully turning businesses around including Silex Microsystems, and ChipOne.“Our partnership will act as a bridge bringing in an established ecosystem of international technology players to nurture Malaysian, local content to serve the global market, ” he said"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,LEE HENG GUIE,Planning a transition and reopening framework,"WE are in a critical stage in the race to end the deadly Covid-19 pandemic, with rising daily infection cases and deaths hitting record level and an overstretched healthcare system.Although the vaccination programme has picked up, it is still slow. The enormous task ahead is to increase the vaccine supply and accelerate vaccination during the three phases of a nationwide lockdown (full movement control order or FMCO), covering two to four weeks.Throughout our fighting journey against the unprecedented pandemic, the implementation of the different phases of movement restrictions, relaxation and reopening (MCO 1, MCO 2, conditional MCO, enhanced MCO and recovery MCO) come with considerable social, economic and political consequences.We are now racing against time. The next two and four weeks of FMCO give us the much-needed breathing space to manage the inflection level and relieve the healthcare system.More urgently is that we must continue to ramp up mass testing, diagnostic checking, contact tracing and isolation as well as getting more people vaccinated, say, at least 30% (9.8 million persons) of targeted population having one dose from 2.36 million persons as of June 5,2021.It was observed that with the exception of MCO 1.0, we were unable to contain the virus spread and flattened the infections to an acceptable and manageable level during the movement restrictions.What have gone wrong? Pandemic fatigue caused the authorities and people to let down their guard in curbing the virus transmission; premature withdrawal or excessive relaxation of MCO restrictions; confusing standard operating procedures (SOP); lax enforcement; and inconsistency and double-standards in the compliance of SOP have caused public to be less compliant despite the hefty fines.The lessons we should have learnt relate to the leadership, public communication, SOP, public self-discipline and the ethics of implementation and enforcement.What’s next after these two weeks of lockdown? We have to start planning and preparing now as we move to the second phase of FMCO (a four-week period starting June 15) so as to ensure a smooth transition of implementation and avoid market confusion.The phases of safe transition from allowing more economic sectors or some social activities to safe reopening of the economy for returning to normalcy will be guided by the level of infectivity and vaccination rate.A responsible and safe transition to a reopening framework covers good and clear communication, gaining public trust and cooperation, influencing public behaviour in compliance, ethics as well as the enforcement of SOP during the lockdown, transition and reopening.> Start early in engaging with industry stakeholders in the preparation of the SOP and get them out at least three days before the date of implementation. This allows time for businesses to get ready and make the necessary arrangements.> Clearly define SOP (simple, consistent, and clear dos and don’ts) to avoid confusion and misinterpretation of the rules and regulations by the law enforcers. Rules that have so many exceptions are impossible to apply and enforce. Whatever rules and SOPs we choose will hurt someone.> The SOP is to be standardised and uniformly applied by the federal, state and local authorities. Make the SOP available in Bahasa Malaysia, English, Mandarin and Tamil.> To avoid confusion and for better compliance, we can consider implementing a tiered system and colour-coded SOP to signify different stages of movement restrictions. The Covid-19 risk assessment will be measured by the level of infectivity: (1) Red (Widespread); (2) Orange (Substantial); (3) Yellow (Moderate); and (4) Green (Minimal). This provides clearer information on the various protocols and restrictions that will apply.> The staged lifting of movement restrictions and reopening will be pegged to the level of vaccination rate, the level of compliance as well as the number of infections as follow:(i) The level of infections has to come down continuously for at least 14 days in a row;(ii) Making use of vaccination as the basis for adjusting social distancing measures in the food and beverage sector, social gathering, leisure sports, religious congregations as well as border control measures, say, to visit tourist attractions and indoor recreation places. For example, in Ontario, Canada, it uses three-step vaccination threshold to draw up a roadmap for reopening: (a) Step 1; 60% adults with one dose; (b) Step 2: 70% adults with one dose; 20% fully vaccinated; and (c) Step 3: 70%-80% adults with one dose; 25% fully vaccinated;It is crucial to instill public trust in the government and Health Ministry to secure citizen support and hence, lead to greater compliance. Transparent disclosure of accurate information, effective communication and timely dissemination of granular data in this critical period is crucial, as misinformation undermines the public health response and aggravate public anxiety.Public response suggests a desire for clear and undisputable rules backed by hard and irrefutable evidence.

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,YVONNE TAN,Hong Seng’s glove business to start ops,"PETALING JAYA: Hong Seng Consolidated Bhd says its first two glove production lines out of the eight planned for this year, should be up and running by the end of this month.Group managing director Datuk Teoh Hai Hin said despite delays due to the Covid-19 restrictive measures, plans for its glove operations should kick off by end-June, pending the lockdown being lifted.“By the end of this year, we hope to get all eight lines up and running, ” he told StarBiz.Despite its detractors, Hong Seng, a newcomer in the glove scene believed that the demand for gloves should still hold strong for at least a couple of years due to the ongoing pandemic and increasing hygiene levels here and globally.After that, the company believed that the average selling prices for gloves will normalise in line with demand, but still be able to give the company a net profit margin of about 20% to 25%.Executive director Kenny Khaw said the eight lines are expected to produce a total of about two billion pieces of gloves per annum.According to him, the RM59mil financing for the company’s glove business will come from the rights issue exercise that has been completed.“We still need to borrow money for working capital, ” he said.Despite banks being increasingly cautious and concerned about their asset quality in the pandemic, Khaw claimed that Hong Seng had an array of financing choices.“We are talking to many banks now and will choose our bankers based on the most attractive terms for us, ” he said.According to Khaw, the company will be able to recover its investment costs after only a year of glove production.Teoh said the demand for the company’s gloves had already exceeded what the company can produce at its initial stage of production.“We are not only looking at healthcare but also other sectors like food and beverage to sell our gloves to, ” he said.Meanwhile, Hong Seng has another ambitious plan that it hopes will materialise.The company plans to set up its own factory to produce raw materials to increase efficiency and lower overall costs in the future.For this reason, it has plans to acquire 105 acres of federal land in Kedah Rubber City for RM45.74mil to set up a nitrile butadiene latex (NBL) manufacturing plant, a main raw material in glove production.Currently, the company sources its raw materials mostly from China.Previously known as MSCM Holdings Bhd, a search and advertising company, Hong Seng saw the entrance of Penang businessman Teoh, last August.After announcing its interest to manufacture gloves, the company shot onto the radar of investors.Teoh is the single largest shareholder in the company, holding a stake of about 15%.Since his emergence into the group, Hong Seng has announced a string of proposed acquisitions including that of a 50% stake in Pantasniaga Sdn Bhd, a company which provides polymerase chain reaction test kits and test labs set-ups for government and medical agencies, a 20% stake in eMedAsia Sdn Bhd which runs www.emedasia.com, an e-health digital platform and a 60% stake in NeoGenix Laboratoire Sdn Bhd, a medical diagnosis and research laboratory company."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,,Ringgit shrugs off lockdown in sign worst of losses may be over,"KUALA LUMPUR: The ringgit has greeted the start of Malaysia’s two-week national lockdown with a show of stability, suggesting any adverse impact from the restrictions may be limited.The currency was Asia’s worst-performer in May, falling almost 1% against the dollar as the nation’s virus cases rose to a record.However, it never breached the March low of just under 4.16 per dollar and steadied last week around 4.13 despite the start of the lockdown.Part of the reason is the impact of the recent tightening of restrictions on economic growth is estimated at less than 1%, according to the Finance Ministry.This is premised on a strategy that targets physical contact-heavy sectors while allowing those that contribute to more than 90% of gross domestic product (GDP) to operate.In fact, some suggest the curbs may actually benefit the currency if they widen Malaysia’s trade surplus by reducing demand for imports and exports remain robust.The latter surged 63% in April on an annual basis.“The lockdown could strengthen the ringgit due to domestic demand compression – as we have seen previously in the case of the Philippines peso or Indian rupee, ” said Trang Thuy Le, Asia FX strategist at Macquarie Capital Ltd in Hong Kong.The rupee was Asia’s best performing currency last month despite Covid-19 continuing to ravage India.The bigger near-term risk for the ringgit may be if the government’s US$9.7bil (RM40bil) aid package spurs foreign investors to sell Malaysian bonds over fiscal deficit fears. But even here the impact of the stimulus may be limited.Economists at MIDF projected Malaysia’s fiscal deficit to be 6.1% of GDP, versus the official government forecast of 6%, after taking the package into account.“Fixed income outflows could rise in the near term on concern of fiscal deterioration, but we think this should be more than offset by weaker imports during lockdown, ” says Le, who sees the ringgit ending this month around 4.12 per dollar.Rising crude prices could also help support the ringgit given the country’s status as a net oil exporter. West Texas Intermediate touched its highest since October 2018 last week. —Bloomberg"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,,"After years in prison, China grocery tycoon weighs twin IPOs","BEIJING: In 2018, Zhang Wenzhong was cleared by China’s top court of financial misconduct charges after earlier spending more than half a decade in prison.Three years later, the Chinese tycoon has revived the supermarket business he founded, and is about to launch two initial public offerings – one in Hong Kong and the other in the United States.It’s a marked reversal of fortunes for Zhang, 59, who watched the Wumart grocery store chain he started in 1994 languish after he was convicted of fraudulently receiving funds from the state, bribery related to a business he had tried to acquire, and using funds from an insurance firm to trade for personal gain.While the convictions were eventually overturned by China’s highest court in 2018, Zhang returned from prison to a company that had been deserted by its employees, suppliers and investors.“This experience let me really understand life is short,” Zhang said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.“Everything can suddenly happen to you. In the meantime, everything will just pass.”In the period since his release – in 2013, after serving a reduced sentence – Zhang has made Wumart a player in China’s hyper-competitive supermarket sector again.He did it by pivoting Wumart stores, known as Wumei in Mandarin, in the direction of innovations that tech giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com Inc pioneered in China’s US$1.3 trillion (RM5.4 trillion) groceries market.These included guaranteeing rapid delivery of fresh groceries, and giving customers the option to bypass check-out counters and pay via mobile phones.Wumart has used its offline supply chain advantages to launch sub-brands selling fish and vegetables good only for a day, while it now delivers to 94% of Beijing compounds within the fifth ring road in as fast as 30 minutes, with its hypermarkets serving as fulfillment centres.Zhang also fought to build scale, borrowing to buy majority stakes in the China businesses of British home-improvement chain B&Q Ltd and German wholesaler Metro AG.Now, he’s looking to raise as much as US$1bil (RM4.13bil) in an initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong for WM Tech Corp, a unit that includes the company’s two flagship chains – Wumart, with 426 stores, and Metro China, which has 97.WM Tech’s prospectus shows its revenue jumped to 39.1 billion yuan (US$6.1bil or RM25bil) in 2020, up from 21.4 billion yuan in 2018, largely due to the Metro acquisition.On its own, the Wumart chain’s revenue grew 6.4% and 8.1% in 2019 and 2020 respectively, according to the documents.Separately, Zhang also founded an e-commerce platform named Dmall Inc that provides online retail solutions, helping traditional brick-and-mortar businesses bring their services online via its cloud and operating systems.Dmall, backed by investors like Tencent Holdings Ltd, IDG Capital and Lenovo Group Ltd’s technology industry fund, is planning to list in the United States as soon as the second half of this year, Bloomberg earlier reported.Still, Zhang faces an uphill battle to keep his businesses growing in China’s fragmented, competitive groceries industry. — Bloomberg"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,,Gold is good but bitcoin better for hedge fund,"NEW YORK: Gold will surge to fresh highs next year, but investors seeking currency alternatives as global debt balloons should look to bitcoin, according to a US$7.5bil (RM31bil) hedge fund.Both are likely to rally even as the Federal Reserve (Fed) moves to taper asset purchases, said Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager at SkyBridge Capital.The two are frequently compared by investors, with former Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers saying cryptocurrencies could stay a feature of global markets as something akin to digital gold.“We’re going to stick to bitcoin and crypto because we just think there’s more upside,” Gayeski said in a telephone interview last week.“While there’s more volatility, you’re going to capture a little bit more juice than you will in gold from that same phenomenon,” he added.Investors are tracking commentary by the US central bank as inflation ticks higher and policy makers move closer to paring the huge asset purchases that rescued the economy from the turmoil caused by the pandemic.The monetary support has driven the Fed’s balance sheet to a record, while muscular fiscal spending has boosted government debt.Both may pose an eventual risk to the dollar’s value, potentially burnishing the appeal of alternatives.”All fiat-currency alternatives – which have all gone through fairly recent substantial corrections – are in a much better place now to handle that eventual taper and gradual slowing of money-supply growth, than they were as they were making higher-highs after higher-highs,” Gayeski said.Both bitcoin and gold have seen substantial swings this year, which unfolded amid a debate about whether the cryptocurrency was drawing demand away from bullion.The digital token soared to a record near US$65,000 (RM268,320) in April, before plunging. It was last around US$36,600 (RM148,610).Gold, meanwhile, came close to sinking into a bear market in March, but reversed course to erase year-to-date losses.Leading Wall Street banks are divided on the relative merits of the pair -- Citigroup Inc. has said gold is “losing lustre” to cryptocurrencies, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc made the case that the two assets can coexist. Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk, whose tweets have roiled bitcoin prices this year, said in May he supports cryptocurrencies over fiat, or paper, currencies.Bullion, which hit a record above US$2,075 (RM11,166) an ounce last year, has now established a floor, according to Gayeski.A lot of the taper talk concerns have been pulled out of the market, and even when it’s announced, the Fed is not going to start reducing the pace of its purchases until 2022, he said.“Going forward, the probability of gold continuing an uptrend is fairly high, making new highs over the next year,” he said.Even as signs of recovery accumulate, the Fed is still buying US$120bil (RM495bil) of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities a month, and its balance sheet has surged toward US$8 trillion (RM33 trillion), about a third of gross domestic product.Talk on tapering that support – which carries the potential to boost Treasury yields and the dollar, tarnishing gold’s appeal – is moving closer.SkyBridge, a fund-of-funds manager, has a small exposure to a gold miner that’s leveraged to a continued gold price rally.Its primary exposures are to US cash-flow-generative strategies, backed by tangible assets, distressed corporate credit and convertible-bond arbitrage among others. The company’s bitcoin fund is up 51.2% since its inception last December through to June 1.SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci has teamed up with First Trust Advisers on an exchange-traded fund that plans to buy and sell bitcoin, and Gayeski expects the Securities and Exchange Commission to approve the product by the fourth quarter of 2021 or the first quarter of next year. — Bloomberg"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,,KEEPING FOODS FROZEN AND FRESH,"Cycleworld serves the the cold chain industry, from food to Covid-19 vaccine storageAT the frozen food section of the supermarket you can find an array of foods such as tempura prawns, fish balls, chapati and many others.Do you ever wonder if the freshness of the foods is maintained throughout the supply chain, and there is no break in the chain when it comes to keeping the items frozen?This is where Cycleworld comes in.With some 28 years of serving the cold chain industry, Cycleworld Corporation Sdn Bhd builds cold rooms to ensure food supplies are kept fresh and frozen.Born and bred in Malaysia, Cycleworld has been a building material provider to the cold chain industry since 1993, serving the food and beverage, cosmetics and logistics industries, and recently, the medical and pharmaceutical industry for Covid-19 vaccine storage.Cycleworld has a factory on a 2ha-site in Klang that manufactures sandwich panels for the Malaysian market and also exports some 50% of its product to Asean countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and Cambodia, to name a few.A manufacturer of insulated sandwich panels – a structure made of three layers including a low-density core and a thin skin-layer bonded to each side – Cycleworld acquires raw material in the forms of chemicals for the production of its polyurethane (PUR) rigid foam and polyisocyanurate (PIR) rigid foam.Cycleworld ‘s panel construction method – steel skin PUR rigid foam panels – was popular in Europe after World War II, where advances in chemical knowledge, quick-build technology together with lightweight construction methods were paramount to the post-war boom.By the late 1950s and early 60s, building a large warehouse with insulated sandwich panels had become mainstream construction and today, almost all large industrial cold rooms are built using insulated sandwich panels.This method is comparable to other building materials like concrete or brick for commercial purposes, except that insulated sandwich panels far exceed the properties of thermal resistance.The insulating property of PUR is touted to be some 700% better than brick, whereby the thermal resistance (km/w) of PUR and PIR is between 0.022 and 0.028km/w whereas brick is only between 0.49 and 0.87 km/w.Meanwhile, when the foam is being manufactured, the foam is thermally bonded on pre-painted galvanised iron (PPGI) skins, and then moulded into sizes resembling large Lego block-like panels.This is the base when building a myriad of applications, such as industrial cold rooms, temperature-controlled warehouses, roofing, communication cabins and many others. Furthermore, this base can span across many industries.The year 2019 was an exceptionally good year for Cycleworld.It completed the supply of insulated panels and cold chains related products, such as Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS), to the single-largest automated cold room built in Vietnam.The construction of the warehouse measured about 120,000cm3 of temperature-controlled space on land spanning some 7,600sqm in Ho Chi Minh City to house more than 59,000 tonnes of product.The same year, Cycleworld unveiled its latest investment, a state-of-the-art 33m double belt that fully automated the production line which quadrupled Cycleworld’s production capacity.This investment has been supported by the increasing demand for cold chain facilities in Malaysia and the Asean region.Today, with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid increase in e-commerce activities which propelled the rise in demand for cold chain and logistic facilities as well.With a strong business foundation, Cycleworld has also diversified its business portfolio by producing a range of panels made from cement fibre board skins – also known as FastFix panels – instead of metal skins used for the construction of modular housing and buildings.Its excellent thermal insulation qualities, as well as its lightweight feature, are suitable for quick builds.This division known as Cycleworld’s Modular Division is at its infancy, but has already gained Industrialised Building System (IBS) status from the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) and has been steadily exporting FastFix panels to Australia over the past five years."
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,,China EV maker betting on its cult status,"SHANGHAI: Since last July, a little-known automaker in China’s southwest has dominated the world’s largest electric car market, outselling bigger players and even Tesla Inc almost every month with a tiny, bare-bones EV that starts at just US$4,500 (RM18,576).The Hongguang Mini is the brainchild of SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co, a joint venture between SAIC Motor Corp and Guangxi Automobile Group Co, two state-backed automakers, and US giant General Motors Co.Based in the city of Liuzhou, known for its limestone mountains and river-snail soup, the company – which has sold some 270,000 of the cars within nine months, making it the best-selling EV in China – has even bigger ambitions for the future. It’s aiming for annual sales of 1.2 million vehicles next year, almost equal to the number of EVs churned out by China’s carmakers in 2020 combined.It’s an eyebrow-raising target, but even before the Hongguang Mini, Wuling had a track record for producing winners in a market that’s defining the new era of driving.Set up in 2002, the Chinese-American JV built its business selling microvans: dependable sliding-door workhorses that earned the nickname “the bread box car” in Mandarin, and were China’s top-selling passenger vehicle in 2017. Millions of them ply the country’s roads, used by contractors and delivery drivers alike.The buyers of those gas-guzzling gray vans are almost exclusively male, which makes Wuling’s pivot to the Hongguang Mini – which has a top speed of 100 kilometers an hour and 12-inch wheels – all the more extraordinary. Shortly after its debut last July, the automaker realised the vehicle was gaining a following among young women, a phenomenon it leaned into with an approach that bends conventional wisdom about how cars are sold.“Our company’s mentality is to produce whatever people need, ” Wuling’s head of branding and marketing, Zhang Yiqin, said in an interview. “We keep close tabs on our users. The hurdles to electric car adoption can only be cleared when consumers find using them a comfortable thing.”To that end, Zhang has staffed his team with employees who understand the Hongguang Mini’s customer base, which is now around two-thirds female. At 35, he jokes he’s the elder statesman of the group whose age averages around 27. Slogans like “Young and Eager” are splashed across the walls of Wuling’s headquarters in Liuzhou, a city that’s embraced EVs alongside the company with 30% of all car sales electric last year, the highest rate in China, according to WAYS Information Technology.Wuling’s success with the Hongguang Mini was driven by a targeted marketing campaign conducted almost entirely online, according to Zhang. His team often communicate with consumers directly via various social media platforms, and it was a customer’s request for more hues that saw the company come up with Hongguang Mini’s latest iteration – the Macaron. It comes in avocado green, lemon yellow and white peach pink, with an optional solid-color roof for contrast, to mimic the vanilla butter cream that sandwiches the French meringue confections of the same name.It’s also how they landed on one of the car’s key selling points – besides its rock-bottom price point: Hongguang Mini drivers are able to customise their vehicles in a way that’s not possible elsewhere.Using “stickers, ” the car’s panels and body can be transformed. Some sport the Nike swoosh, some have galaxy-like outer space scenes and others cartoon characters from Hello Kitty and Doraemon. The original Hongguang Mini comes in around 20 different base colors, which can be switched up, and buyers can customize the interior as well. — Bloomberg"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,,China’s trade boom continues in May on strong global demand,"BEIJING: China’s exports continued to surge in May, although at a slower pace than the previous month, fuelled by strong global demand as more economies around the world opened up. Imports soared, boosted by rising commodity prices.Exports grew almost 28% in US dollar terms in May from a year earlier, the customs administration said, weaker than forecast and below the pace in April, but still well above historical growth rates. Imports soared 51.1%, the fastest pace since March 2010, leaving a trade surplus of US$45.5bil (RM187.82bil) for the month.Overseas demand for Chinese goods remained strong as economies from the UK to the US emerged from months of lockdown. Exports to emerging markets like India and in South-East Asia, which have seen a resurgence in Covid-19 outbreaks, also climbed. South Korea’s exports, a bellwether for world trade, surged the most since 1988 in May, a sign that the global recovery is strengthening.“It’s still a fairly healthy set of numbers, ” Jonathan Cavenagh, senior market strategist at Informa Global Markets, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV. “We know that global demand is still recovering and that trend is likely to continue towards the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter as the major developed economies open up.”Exports to the US moderated, although still grew at a healthy pace of about 21% growth, while shipments to the European Union slowed to an almost 13% expansion. Purchases by Indian companies jumped more than 100% for the second straight month.There was also a shift in categories driving export growth. Sales of household appliances and lighting grew, while there was a more than 41% drop of textile and fabric goods, which includes masks and protective clothing.These changes “seem to be consistent with our view that strengthening exports of non-Covid related products offset weakening exports of Covid-related products as global vaccination proceeds, ” Goldman Sachs Group economists wrote in a note.China’s exports will keep up their good momentum in the first half of the year, Gao Feng, a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said last week.Higher commodity prices and last year’s low base continued to drive up imports. The economy’s strong recovery from the pandemic has fuelled demand for commodities, also helping to boost their prices.Imports of iron ore and concentrate were up 85.5% by value in the first five months of the year, but only 6% by volume. Copper ore and concentrate imports were up 54.5% by value, but only 6.4% by volume.Those record prices are pushing up costs for businesses. The government has recently ratcheted up its campaign to tame prices and curb inflation pressures.The data may have been distorted by fewer working days in May due to the five-day Labour Day holiday. There were also disruptions at one of China’s busiest ports from late May due to a Covid-19 outbreak, which could have impacted the data.“Exports surprised a bit on the downside, maybe due to the Covid cases in Guangdong province which slowed down the turnover in Shenzhen and Guangzhou ports, ” said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.“The risk of supply chain disruption is rising” and export prices and shipping costs will likely rise further as Guangdong plays a critical role in the global supply chain, he wrote.Chinese factory gate prices likely rose 8.5% in May from a year earlier, according to the median estimate ahead of data due tomorrow. — Bloomberg"

Liao has spent 24 years at HSBC and was seen as one of the front-runners in replacing Wong, who has been crucial in steering the bank’s sometimes rocky relationship with China. Rosha joined HSBC in 1991 and was named CEO of India in 2018.“Given HSBC’s push into Asia, the appointments look appropriate with the need for regional expertise and stability at the management level, ” said Andrew Wong, a credit analyst at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “HSBC’s current operating environment and execution of its strategic plan appear to be on track.”Wong will become non-executive chairman of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, the firm’s local unit, and also serve as an adviser to Quinn and chairman Mark Tucker.Wong had been preparing for his eventual retirement by mentoring Liao and Mark Yunfeng Wang, the head of its China operations, people familiar with the matter have said.A member of China’s top political-advisory body – the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference – Wong’s ties have been pivotal to mending relations with Beijing, frayed by the lender’s role in a US probe of Huawei Technologies Co.He was also the point person when HSBC last year endorsed the controversial security law imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing.The bank is also building up its leadership further in Hong Kong, its biggest market.

It is also Southeast Asia’s first integrated phosphate complex.Phase 1 comprises three plants which will produce yellow phosphorus, technical grade phosphoric acid and food grade phosphoric acid. It will have an annual production of 48,000 tonnes, 75,000 tonnes and 60,000 tonnes respectively.“To date, the facility has secured 60% of long-term commitments for both raw material supply and product offtakes, ” said Lugun.As the first non-alloy based facility within the SIP that caters for energy-intensive industries, he pointed out that MPAS will propel the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (Score) and CMS into a dynamic new industrial sector that offers long-term sustainable growth.“It offers opportunities for investment in downstream manufacturing such as the industrial chemicals, animal feed, fertiliser, cleaning and detergent sectors.“For the long term, the business within these sectors are expected to be drawn to the SIP so that they can be located nearby to their feedstock supplier, ” he added.On OM Sarawak, Lugun (pic below) said AU$20mil (RM63.27mil) has been invested to install a sinter plant which will further lower manganese alloy production costs.During the initial hot commissioning and performance testing period of the sinter plant, trial production of 22,826 tonnes of manganese sinter ore was produced and 7,132 tonnes sold in January-March 2021 quarter, said OMH.OMH said the remaining manganese sinter ore produced was utilised as feed material for the plant’s production of manganese alloys.“Planning of Phase 2 of the (smelting) facility is in progress which will add to further economies of scale. This entails the modification of two existing ferrosilicon furnaces to produce silicon manganese and another two to produce metallic silicon to better capitalise on the present market situation as well as the construction of up to four more manganese alloy furnaces by 2022, ” said Lugun.OM Sarawak’s smelting plant has a design capacity to produce some 200,000 to 210,000 tonnes of ferrosilicon (FeSi) and 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes of manganese alloys per annum.As at March 31 2021,12 out of the 16 furnaces were in operation with six furnaces producing FeSi and six others producing manganese alloys.Of the remaining four FeSi furnaces, two of them have been idled for the purpose of conversion to produce manganese alloys and the other two currently idled and ready to be re-started once manpower constraints have been alleviated, according to OMH in its March 2021 quarterly production and market update.“The planned conversion of the two idled FeSi furnaces is progressing as planned, with furnace excavation and civil work in progress.”OMH said manpower shortages continued to impact the smelting plant’s ability to operate at full capacity as the Malaysian border remains closed with strict travel restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 pandemic.“Production plan for the second half of 2021 may be readjusted in accordance with latest conditions as the Covid-19 situation evolves, depending on manpower availability and scheduled leave rotation requirements, ” it added.In the March 2021 quarter, OM Sarawak raised its FeSi production volume by 13.4% to 38,415 tonnes from 33,866 tones in December 2020 quarter. However, the production volume of manganese alloys fell by 7.6% to 57,136 tonnes from 61,806 tonnes during the same period, said OMH.“The sales volumes for both FeSi and manganese alloys decreased by 45.5% and 37.5% respectively as the pace of destocking inventory stablished during the quarter ended 31 March 2021.“Sales volumes were significantly higher in the previous quarter following a surge in demand from end users as steel mills collectively restocked ferrolloys in December 2020, ” added OMH."
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,,China’s investment push,"BEIJING: China is expected to roll out more policy support to boost the confidence of both public and private investment and help better unleash consumption potential to realise steady and healthy economic growth for 2021, experts and industrial insiders said.A report issued on Sunday by Tsinghua University’s Academic Centre for Chinese Economic Practice and Thinking said China’s gross domestic product is expected to expand by 8.2% year-on-year in 2021, investment in fixed assets will continue to climb and the recovery of consumption will be relatively slower.In response to the global trend of rising commodity prices and its possible impact on the domestic economy, the report said, such price surge is likely to be mild, because of speedy vaccination progress in many advanced economies in the latter half of the year, and will not strongly affect consumer prices or cause domestic inflation.The expansion of the consumer price index in China is likely to come in at 1.5% year-on-year growth this year, the report projected.In a recent Morgan Stanley briefing, Robin Xing, its chief China economist, said China will face less inflation pressure compared with advanced economies, including the US.Xing said this is because China’s stimulus policy has tapered off and returned to normalcy at a relatively earlier stage.Some of China’s regulatory approaches in the economy, such as its regulation of virtual currency and various asset bubbles, sharply contrast with the aggressive stimulus in advanced economies.More efforts are needed for deepening structural reform in the long run and in optimising relations between government and the market, Li Daokui, a professor and director of the Tsinghua think tank, said on Sunday at the release of the report.In the long run, he said, there is huge potential in China’s economic growth, as both the public and private sectors have strong willingness to work hard for a better living.Moreover, greater efforts will be made to ensure better synergy in the interactions between government and the market, Li said.The report also said that the role of consumption in catalysing growth has not been fully unleashed in the first two quarters, and the level of consumption has so far not returned to the pre-pandemic level, as an increase of business output has not effectively fed through to the level of household incomes.“Also, the scattering resurgence of Covid-19 cases has wound down people’s willingness to engage in offline activities, while the pandemic per se has deeply changed people’s habits of buying and overall reduced the amount of offline consumption,” said Li Bing, a researcher at the think tank.Considering the stark differences in vaccine rollouts globally, multispeed recoveries are underway in all regions and across income groups, which makes the global recovery still uncertain, the report said.Guo Meixin, a researcher at the Tsinghua think tank, pointed out that the yuan has recently appreciated against the US dollar yet many uncertainties remain in this trend.“The sizable stimulus measures in US and European countries will phase out once the Covid-19 situation gets effectively controlled, and liquidity is likely to subsequently flow back to developed countries,” Guo said.“Therefore, the yuan’s trend for appreciation is not likely to exist over the long run.”The report also suggested swifter efforts be made to prune local government debt and warned about certain operational difficulties for some medium-sized and small banks.On Saturday, the G-7 group of countries announced they would set a minimum global corporate tax at a rate of at least 15%.Chen Xingdong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas, said that this is likely to draw investors from countries like China back toward advanced economies, and that China needs to move faster in improving the business climate. — China Daily/ANN"

Buyers can now complete almost the entire transaction without ever leaving their home, ” he added.Kashif said the survey also found that 68% of Malaysians wished to go back to working at the office or some other workplace at least two days a week, post-pandemic.“Some office workers have discovered they can sometimes get more done and have greater job satisfaction working from home, but it’s not for everyone. Only 27% of people want to work from home full time.“The new work-from-home phenomenon during the lockdowns has changed the sort of home that house buyers look for, as buyers are looking for bigger spaces, separate work nooks or home offices and extra bedrooms when they can afford them, ” he said.Despite the current troubles, Kashif said 71% of Malaysians believed that life in the country would be back to pre-pandemic normal by the end of next year. — Bernama"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,,G7 strikes deal on tax rules for US tech giants,"LONDON: The Group of Seven (G7) rich nations secured a landmark deal that could help countries collect more taxes from big companies and enable governments to impose levies on US tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc and Facebook Inc.The agreement by the G7 finance ministers in London satisfies a US demand for a minimum corporate tax rate of “at least 15%” on foreign earnings and paves the way for levies on multinationals in countries where they make money, instead of just where they are headquartered.The deal is aimed at modernising the century-old international tax code and cools transatlantic tensions that threatened to spill into a trade war under Donald Trump. But key details are still to be nailed down, more nations must sign on, and full implementation could take years.US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen, among the finance chiefs who hailed the announcement as an unprecedented step, said a final accord on which companies could see their profits taxed outside their home countries would include the likes of Amazon and Facebook.“What you’re seeing is a revival of multilateralism, a willingness of leading nations in the G7 and G20, to cooperate to address the most critical challenges facing the global economies,” Yellen said after the meeting.Focus will now shift to a July meeting of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Italy and long-running talks between about 140 countries at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The G7 pact marks a step to re-write a global system that critics said allowed big companies to save billions of dollars in tax bills by shifting jurisdictions.It’s also help address complaints that major digital companies can make money in multiple countries and pay taxes only at home.In response to the announcement, some of the world’s biggest tech companies focused on how the deal could help clear up the rules on where to pay taxes.“Today’s agreement is a significant first step toward certainty for businesses and strengthening public confidence in the global tax system,” Facebook’s global affairs vice- president Nick Clegg said on Twitter.An Amazon spokesperson said the OECD-led process “will help bring stability to the international tax system” and described Saturday’s deal as a “welcome step forward in the effort to achieve this goal.”Under the Trump administration, the United States had also refused to allow foreign governments to tax American digital companies, a key European demand.The transatlantic division spiralled into a battle of unilateral measures and threats of trade sanctions, which although suspended, are still in place.According to the communique after the London meeting, countries where big firms operate would get the right to tax “at least 20%” of profits exceeding a 10% margin.That would apply to “the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises,” potentially enabling the G-7 to square the circle so that digital is included without being targeted.Asked whether that means companies like Facebook and Amazon would be included, Yellen said they would qualify “by almost any definition,” and “most of those firms are likely to be included in this new scheme.”The ministers of the UK and France both said they were now assured that tech giants would be in the cross-hairs of new rules, even as the final quantitative criteria are still to be determined.“We’ve been fighting for four years in all European and international forums, here at the G7 and the G20 for a fair taxation of digital giants and for a minimum corporate tax,” France’s Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.The antipathy in recent years was greatest between Paris and Washington.France was the first country to bypass the slow-going OECD process on how to tax profits, opting for a controversial levy exclusively on the digital revenues of large firms.The G7 said that countries would “provide for appropriate coordination” to remove such digital services taxes.Resolving the exact sequencing of that could prove tricky, with countries unwilling to give up revenues before they have certainty over what they will gain from new global rules.Italian Finance Minister Daniele Franco said he’ll aim to broaden the discussion when G20 finance ministers meet in July in Venice. Once the proposal is agreed, Italy will no longer need its digital tax, he said.Japan’s Finance Minister, Taro Aso said the change in US leadership this year had opened space for an agreement and criticism of the big profits being made by tech companies also galvanised the group to take action.Two issuesHighlighting other remaining divisions, the finance minister of Ireland, whose country has attracted some of the world’s big businesses with low taxes, said any deal on a minimum rate must meet the needs of “small and large countries, developed and developing.”Pushing in the other direction, Le Maire said the 15% is a starting point and France would fight for a higher rate in the coming weeks.President Joe Biden’s administration still needs approval from the US Congress and will hope the deal hands it leverage for its massive infrastructure program.It is seeking support from lawmakers to raise the domestic corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.An international deal for 15% could help him because it offers multinationals options.Two top Republican lawmakers said the agreement “appears premature given the many unanswered questions about the pillar one and pillar two proposals and their potential effect on American companies and US revenues. We continue to caution against moving forward in a way that could adversely affect US businesses,” Senate finance committee ranking member Mike Crapo and house ways and means ranking member Kevin Brady said in a statement.The OECD has said a final global deal may not come until October, with delivery requiring nations to pass the plan through national legislatures. “There is important work left to do,” said OECD secretary-general Mathias Cormann. “But this decision adds important momentum to the coming discussions.” — Bloomberg"

Using livestreaming, she sells handmade shoes, bags and locally grown agricultural products on well-known e-commerce platforms.On average, a typical livestream session of hers attracts audiences of nearly 10,000 potential e-shoppers. During the show, she demonstrates stitching soles for shoes made of cloth, an ancestral skill she has come to master.“Now, I’ve another job-to teach female villagers to sell products through livestreaming on e-commerce platforms,” said Zhou.Her livestreaming studio resembles an art gallery with ethnic styles. It is located in the village of Yantouwan in Macheng city, Hubei province. Two separate rooms are full of webcast equipment. Zhou’s two female colleagues sell chrysanthemum tea, the bestselling product among local specialities. In 2020, products worth more than 5 million yuan (US$782,364 or RM3.2mil) were sold online from here.Yang Zuozhu, party secretary of Yantouwan village, called this gallery “a home of internet celebrities”.Through online sales platforms, local internet “celebrities” not only help sell local agricultural products but also products that have sold well in other places.E-commerce and farming have become two key sources of livelihood. Online sales generate the largest chunk of income for local villagers, he said.Yang showed some infrastructure set up in the village to promote the so-called Internet economy, including a training school for webcast hosts, a courier firm, and an outdoor park that serves as a set where ads are shot and also doubles up as a site for tours. — China Daily/ANNTo support infrastructure construction and promote e-commerce, the local government of Macheng city has continuously injected fiscal funds. Local authorities saw this new business model as a driver of consumption and economic growth, which earlier helped in poverty alleviation.According to Bao Bin, head of the local finance department of Macheng city, nearly 830 million yuan (RM535mil) of fiscal funds will be integrated and coordinated this year to consolidate and expand progress in poverty alleviation with rural revitalisation. Part of the funds, totaling 130 million yuan (RM83mil), will be used to develop rural specialty industries.It is in line with the provincial-level government’s work plan for this year to promote the rural revitalisation strategy in Central China’s Hubei province. From this year to 2025, the finance department of Hubei increased its budget by 500 million yuan per year to support major enterprises in technology development, agricultural production, key equipment purchases and cold chain logistics, said Jin Weifeng, an official from the provincial finance department.The local government will also integrate 500 million yuan per year for subsidizing major enterprises’ bank loans, Jin said.About 20 kilometers away from Yantouwan village is a base of chrysanthemum. Some edible varieties of this flower are used as tea, snacks and to make traditional Chinese medicine. Many of the products sold by Zhou online are from factories around this flower-growing base.The chrysanthemum industry has become a pillar of Huangtugang town’s economy in Macheng. The government has allocated 80 million yuan to build four new greenhouses, an exhibition, a factory making chrysanthemum byproducts and a seedling workshop, according to local officials.The chrysanthemum industry has changed from traditional extensive planting to the integration and demonstration development pattern that integrates chrysanthemum scientific research, standardized planting, intensive processing, cultural display and horticultural health preservation, they said.This specialty industry can provide more than 2,000 households, which have been lifted out of poverty, with an average annual income of more than 10,000 yuan, and the output of the whole industry chain in the town exceeds 300 million yuan, local officials said.“To promote rural revitalization, we cannot stick to all the old models of poverty alleviation. Instead, we need to innovate new measures and consolidate the results. Key obligations of the finance departments include raising funds and supervising the usage of funds, to ensure that the money is injected into the right areas,” said Hu Qingchao, deputy head of the finance department of Macheng city.The municipal-level government in Macheng arranged 120 million yuan to support large-scale industrial development projects in counties. “We took flexible management methods. If the projects are not profitable, we will recall the funds and reallocate them to other priority areas,” Hu said."

Prices peaked at 73.74 cents, surpassing the previous 2008 record, during the overnight trading session.Rising vegetable oil prices are contributing to the highest global food prices in more than a decade, raising livestock feed costs for meat plants and threatening the potential of biofuels to help governments meet climate emissions goals.New-crop soyoil contracts were posting even bigger gains, supported by concerns that the supplies will remain tight if the harvest of the soybean crop that is currently being seeded in the U.S. Midwest disappoints.Soyoil futures have jumped 71.3% this year due to dwindling supplies of soybeans that have left end users scrambling to keep up with global demand for food and animal feed products, let alone greener fuels like renewable diesel.The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast global supplies of soybeans will fall 10.3% to a five-year low of 86.55 million tonnes by September.The stocks situation will continue to pressure prices in the coming months as processors struggle to find enough supplies to keep plants that crush soybeans into oil and meal operating at desired levels.Companies including U.S. agricultural commodities trader Cargill Inc have announced plans to invest in expanded soybean processing capacity, but increased crushing is contingent on more availability of oilseed crops.""If the crush rates don't keep up pace, things are going to get a little tight in the balance sheet come August,"" said Terry Reilly, senior commodity analyst at Futures International.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler (pic) said on Monday that SEC staff should consider tougher restrictions on such changes and increased transparency.""When insiders or companies adopt 10b5-1 plans, there’s currently no cooling-off period required before they make their first trade,"" Gensler said at the Wall Street Journal's CFO Network event. ""I worry that some bad actors could perceive this as a loophole to participate in insider trading.""While the rules do not treat canceling a trading plan as a securities transaction, Gensler added that doing so may be ""as economically significant as carrying out an actual transaction.""He had also asked staff to consider more robust disclosures regarding the adoption, modification and terms of the trading plans. An SEC proposal could also curb the number of plans executives can set up and reduce the risk of improper trading by requiring insiders to wait up to six months after a plan’s conception before trading, he added.Dennis Kelleher, head of Washington-based nonprofit Better Markets, said the proposed changes were long overdue.""Executives have been able to game the system, including engaging in de facto insider trading, by creating, changing, and canceling these stock trading plans in secret and virtually at will.""- Reuters"

It is now the first day of the prosecution, and that is difficult for us,"" Evert van Zijtveld, who lost his two children Frederique and Robert-Jan and his wife's parents, told journalists as he walked into court.After a year of mostly procedural hearings, judges announced the start of the evidence phase on Monday. From Tuesday the judges will begin summarising the evidence gathered by investigators in the case, and potentially calling witnesses.Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said his panel would be looking specifically to determine what type of missile hit the airplane, where it was fired from and whether the four suspects can be held responsible.""It is taking a long time but we want to know the truth. It is the only thing we can still do for the children,"" said Rob Frederiksz, whose 23-year-old son Bryce died along with his girlfriend Daisy in the crash.After years of collecting evidence, a team of international investigators concluded in May 2018 that the missile launcher used to shoot down the aircraft belonged to Russia's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade. The Dutch government holds Moscow responsible. Russia denies any involvement.On Monday the Kremlin said it was following the trial and took note of ""alternative information"" that could lead to other explanations of the crash from the Dutch prosecutor's main theory of the Russian-made missile fired by pro-Russian separatists.""But again, because we are not part of the investigation, we cannot directly influence what is happening, ” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.- Reuters"

""It's just a little bit of cramps and a little bit of low back pain.""There was no chance that I could win a point, so I decided to retire because I think it was the best thing.""MUSETTI QUITSA relieved Djokovic went 4-0 ahead in the decider before Musetti quit in an anti-climactic end to what was brewing up to be a seismic shock in a tournament already full of surprises.Djokovic said he had felt nervous before the match and even ""liked"" the fact that he lost the opening two sets.""I don't know, I just played under a certain kind of tension and wasn't able to go through my shots,"" he told reporters.""Just not playing and not feeling great in the first couple of sets. But credit to him for playing well in important moments. After I lost the second set and went out to change and came back, I just felt different. I was a different player.""Musetti dropped serve early on but hit back when Djokovic made a backhand error and from then on went toe-to-toe with the 18-time Grand Slam champion who appeared unsure how to counter the all-court flair of his young opponent.Djokovic was 4-1 ahead in the first set tiebreak but Musetti unleashed two stunning single-handed backhand winners to close the gap and then carved out a set point when Djokovic dragged a forehand into the net at 5-5.Musetti smiled ruefully when Djokovic saved that with a forehand flush onto the sideline. But the young Italian swiped away two forehand winners to take the opener.DJOKOVIC RATTLEDA rattled Djokovic blazed a forehand wide to surrender serve early in the second set but quickly replied as Musetti's concentration wavered.Djokovic had to dig deep to save break points at 2-3 and 3-4 and eventually took the set into a tiebreak.A terrible misjudgement by Djokovic saw him leave an improvised lob from Musetti that landed on the baseline with the Serb bizarrely offering no shot.When Musetti punished more Djokovic errors to move two sets ahead it seemed he was on the brink of a momentous victory.Djokovic left the court to change clothes and when he returned, he might have suspected Musetti had been replaced by a look-alike. He broke serve straight away and suddenly the Italian looked lost, making basic errors and appearing sluggish.Djokovic needed no second invitation to take advantage and lost only 14 points in levelling the match in a flash -- the third and fourth sets lasted 46 minutes in total compared with the 75 minutes it took Musetti to win the superb opener.After that, there was no way back for teenager Musetti as the 34-year-old Djokovic overturned a two-set deficit for only the fifth time in his career.""It's unfortunate for a young player like him,"" Djokovic said. ""He was unable to physically sustain the level.""(Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Ken Ferris and Hugh Lawson)"

Me or the clubs? If they do not take care of the welfare or salaries of the players, how can I be the person ruining the league?” he questioned.“I spend according to my means. My rivals have to spend according to their budget. In financial management, you mismanage, that’s your failure, not mine.“I rescue the players who are not getting salaries.“You can ask the PFAM president about players who haven’t received their wages and what I do for them. Every Raya, who gives Raya pocket money?“I am the owner of JDT. What’s my responsibility? The success of my club. Whatever the strategy, commercial, recruitment or academy, that’s our responsibility.“Look at Bayern (Munich), they buy players from their rivals because they want to make their team successful.“If I have to buy players to improve the team, I will buy that player. If I’ve to develop, I will develop.“My responsibility is towards JDT. If I have to buy more players, I will buy them.”Under his leadership, the Southern Tigers have won 17 trophies, of which seven of them were Super League titles. This season, they are top of the league table with 30 points.He had further enhanced his squad for the Super League when he signed Nathaniel Hong Wan from the Wolverhampton youth team in the second transfer window, and Indonesian midfielder Syahrian Abhimanyu who will return to the club after his loan stint with A-League side Newcastle Jets.He also added former Perak duo centreback Shahrul Saad and striker Guilherme De Paula in the recently concluded second transfer window.On another question that his style of managing the club borders on arrogance, Tunku Ismail said to run a professional club, you need to be the best and not be humble all the time.“If we run a professional club, you need the best transportation, clothing and players. You need to look presentable and professional. In competition, there is no humbleness.“In competition, you need an ego booster.”"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Sport,,Portugal’s young talents waiting in the wings,"LISBON: Portugal begin the defence of their European title at Euro 2020 boasting a wealth of young attacking talent lining up behind veteran superstar Cristiano Ronaldo.Bernardo Silva, Diogo Jota, Joao Felix and Andre Silva are part of a new wave of attack-minded players who will be pushing for the Portuguese to become the second nation to retain the European Championship after neighbours Spain.After missing Euro 2016 through injury, 26-year-old Bernardo Silva has become a fixture in Portugal’s starting XI, scoring seven goals in 54 appearances and providing the same dynamic, forward-thinking presence as for his club Manchester City.Another of Portugal’s Premier League stars Diogo Jota has recovered from injury just in time to take part in the Euro and played in Friday’s goalless draw with Spain.With six goals in 12 international appearances, the 24-year-old Liverpool forward has shown that he could replace Ronaldo up front just as easily as he can develop alongside the five-time Ballon d’Or winner.Despite his average height (5ft 10in or 1.78m), he also managed to score three headed goals in 2022 World Cup qualifying matches against Serbia and Luxembourg in March.Touted as the successor to Ronaldo, Joao Felix has so far failed to fulfil his obvious potential, ending this season out of the Atletico Madrid starting line-up and at just 21 with the air of a player lost.Breaks away from the Spanish capital with the national team have changed little, with Felix starting on the bench against Azerbaijan and Serbia in World Cup qualifying before being substituted before half-time by coach Fernando Santos against Luxembourg following a distracted performance.He also made little impact in the 0-0 draw with Spain, which was played at Atletico’s Wanda Metropolitano stadium.“I don’t think I’ve lost my talent. Talent tends to evolve and as a team player I believe I’m continuing to evolve,” Felix said during preparation for the Euro.Andre Silva meanwhile comes into the tournament off the back of his best ever season that put him in some exalted company in the goalscoring charts.The 25-year-old scored 28 Bundesliga goals this term as Eintracht Frankfurt missed out on Champions League football by just a point, and he was fourth in the chase for the European Golden Shoe behind Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski.“I believe I’m having the best period of my career both mentally and physically. I come here motivated and confident following the season I’ve just had,” Andre Silva said after joining the national team training.However despite his record of 16 goals in 38 Portugal matches, he seems to be incompatible with Ronaldo, the pair proving ineffective against the modest resistance of Azerbaijan during a 1-0 World Cup qualifying win.Portugal are not lacking in talent but it remains to be seen if a talented supporting cast can link up with its leading light Ronaldo, who is just six goals short of Iranian Ali Daei’s all-time international record of 103 goals and level with Michel Platini’s record mark of nine European Championship strikes. — AFP"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Sport,,Germans spoil English party in superbly organised tournament,"“WHEN football comes home.”There has never been a slogan more fitting for a European Championships than in 1996.England hosted one of the best organised tournaments ever – the first Euros to feature 16 finalists, following UEFA’s decision to expand the competition from eight teams.For one glorious month, it really did feel like the Beautiful Game had come home.The only thing amiss, sadly, was Terry Venables’ Three Lions failed to triumph on their own turf.That, however, did not stop the tournament from being a magical experience for the players and fans. It left a lingering feel-good factor that has been sorely lacking for England in most major Finals since.What made it so special, apart from the fact that the sun was shining and England were winning – until the last four – was that there was something exceptional about Venables’ cast.Master marksman Alan Shearer described the side as the best he had played in during his eight-year international career, as the lads had an exemplary team spirit to match.Lively and Lion-heartedEngland, led by Tony Adams, started slowly with a stuttering 1-1 draw against Switzerland, a tie noted only for Shearer’s first international goal in 12 games.But things quickly got much better from there.A much livelier display saw the hosts sinking Scotland 2-0, with a spectacular solo strike by Paul Gascoigne – and his unforgettable “dentist’s chair” celebration – being the showcase.Then came the classic last group game against Holland. The English, at their lion-hearted best, demolished Guus Hiddink’s side 4-1 with Shearer and Teddy Sheringham bagging a brace each.It was now on to the quarter-finals with high expectations.Pain of penaltiesIt almost became a spot of bother for England when the goals dried up against Spain.The resolute Spaniards held on for a 0-0 draw after extra time, leaving the hosts scrapping to earn a 4-2 shootout win.Stuart Pearce provided some imagery to rival that of Gascoigne’s – Psycho’s fist-pumping celebration after despatching his penalty became a talking point.But the talk that followed next was one of heartbreak – against eternal foes Germany in the semi-final at Wembley.In a truly epic encounter, Shearer headed England into the lead after just three minutes but 13 minutes later, Germany levelled through Stefan Kuntz.Venables’ super-charged charges threatened with a series of near misses but the score stayed that way after extra time.It was left to penalties to decide again – an all too familiar ending from England’s point of view.Shearer, David Platt, Pearce, Gascoigne and Sheringham all converted but Germany were also successful with their first five efforts.It was sudden death next. Gareth Southgate’s tame effort was saved by Andreas Kopke, and Andreas Muller stepped up to fire Germany into the final.After the heart-breaking loss, legendary commentator Barry Davies said: “If somebody told me you are going up to heaven and you can take one game with you, I think I would take that England game.I’d try to get the result changed when I got up there, though.”To rub salt into England’s wound, Germany would go on to win the final, edging an exciting Czech Republic side 2–1."

He would go on to drop 11 more strokes in the next eight holes, no thanks to further two bogeys, three double bogeys and a triple bogey at No. 13.Gavin has now missed six cuts in all nine European starts to date, a stark contrast to the previous season where he qualified for the final two rounds on eight occasions with the same number of tournaments.He did not just make the cut, but also performed strongly by finishing no worse than a 27th placing and even finished an incredible joint-third at Saudi International which boast a world-class field that included American Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson.Gavin’s next competition is the rebranded Scandinavian Mixed, which begins in Gothenburg, Sweden on Thursday.The unique mixed-field tournament will feature 78 men and women from the respective European Tour and Ladies European Tour.

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Sport,,Belgium and Holland win final pre-Euro friendlies,"PARIS: Belgium and Holland completed their Euro 2020 preparations with respective wins over Croatia and Georgia.Belgium, the world’s top-ranked side, beat the 2018 World Cup runners up 1-0 thanks to a first half goal from in-form Romelu Lukaku, fresh from winning the Serie A title with Inter Milan.Roberto Martinez’s side will be one of the favourites to win what would be their first ever major international trophy and line up in Group B alongside Denmark, Finland and Russia.In a tight match it was Lukaku, 28, who was the difference between the two sides in a cagey contest, and he was unlucky not to open the scoring in the 31st minute with a wonder goal.Holding off three Croatia defenders, Lukaku unleashed a curling shot which looked to be heading in before it crashed out off the bar, with Yannick Carrasco’s header on the rebound also thudding onto the woodwork.However, he gave his side the lead seven minutes later when he pounced following confusion in the Croatia penalty area and lashed home his 60th international goal.Few clear-cut chances came along after that, but Lukaku should have netted his second of the night with a minute remaining when his close-range header was somehow kept out by Croatia goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic.The Dutch had an easier time of it with a 3-0 win over Georgia.Frank de Boer’s team will be aiming to make a big impression at their first major tournament since the 2014 World Cup and play all their Group C matches with Ukraine, Austria and North Macedonia in Amsterdam.Denmark also go into the tournament on a high after seeing off Bosnia 2-0 in Brondby.Austria drew 0-0 with Slovakia while Scotland scraped a 1-0 win over 10-man Luxembourg ahead of their first major international tournament appearance for 23 years.England manager Gareth Southgate was upset with substitute Jordan Henderson for defying team orders as the midfielder decided to take a penalty and missed in the 1-0 win over Romania.Henderson returned to action for the first time since being sidelined with a groin injury in February by taking the field as a half-time substitute but he denied striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin who won the spot-kick and was expected to take it.The Liverpool captain saw his shot palmed away by Romania goalkeeper Florin Nita in the 78th minute after Marcus Rashford had netted England’s first penalty 10 minutes earlier before the striker was replaced shortly afterwards.“We had Marcus Rashford on penalties then James Ward-Prowse but both came off, ” Southgate told ITV.“We expected Dominic Calvert-Lewin to take it and I was expecting Hendo to go over to him and let him take it. We will pull rank next time.”Henderson told the BBC: “I was confident but it was a good save. It wasn’t a great penalty but I am not too bothered. It would have been nice to cap the comeback off with a goal.” — Agencies"

Because we can’t continue losing points like we’ve done in Monaco and here.""Monaco and Baku were always seen as tracks where Mercedes might have a harder time, but the dominant team of the last seven years looked jaw-droppingly off the pace in practice in Baku before Hamilton unlocked some performance on Saturday.He might have won on Sunday had he not hit a brake button by accident at the re-start after Verstappen's crash and gone down an escape road.In Monaco, Bottas had to retire while in second place after the team were unable to remove a wheel at his pitstop. It finally came off at the factory some 43 hours later.""In the last two races we haven't been good enough. Not fast enough, we've made mistakes, we struggle to switch the tyres on and we've been on the back-foot through free practice,"" said trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin.""We know the level it takes to win championships and we're not at that level right now so we need to re-group and come back performing the way we know that we can.""We have the team, the car and the drivers to win this, but we need to be tough and honest with ourselves over the next few days.""(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, Editing by Hugh Lawson)"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Metro,GRACE CHEN,Handling waste safely,"At a time when double masking is encouraged for maximum protection against Covid-19, it has come to light that some sanitation workers are not wearing necessary protective gear as they go about their work.Welfare and animal rights group Persatuan Penyayang and Kesaksamaan Kuala Lumpur (PPKKL) president Idris Moktar shared his observations of sanitation workers accompanying rubbish trucks on their rounds in Kampung Baru and the Chow Kit area.“Watching workers handle bags of rubbish with their bare hands leaves me to wonder if they have been properly briefed on the possible dangers of infectious materials like used sanitary pads, diapers or face masks, which are regularly found in domestic waste.“As some of the workers are foreigners, it is possible that they may not understand what is being said at daily briefings though they are seen wearing masks and gloves when they clock in for inspection.“Ideally, there should be instructional pamphlets printed out in the workers’ native tongue so that the message on donning personal protective equipment (PPE) can be effectively conveyed,” he told StarMetro.Former SS20 Rukun Tetangga (RT) chairman Eileen Thong, who echoed Idris’ sentiments, said masks, gloves, safety footwear and sanitisers should be part of these workers’ standard operating procedure while on their collection rounds.“Seeing the workers touching rubbish without gloves and wearing their masks below their noses or on chins is worrying as our waste now consists of thousands of used face masks,” she added.PPE is essentialEnvironment and waste management specialist Dr Theng Lee Chong agrees that donning PPE is compulsory for workers in this sector by international standards.In fact, it is essential for their safety.“In a housing estate, for example, there is no way of knowing who are the users of the discarded items.“So for their own safety, workers should not even open the rubbish bags to rummage for recyclables as they may come in contact with needles, bandages or even drinking bottles used by individuals who have infectious diseases.“At the very least, they should have aprons, gloves and rubber boots to safeguard against exposure to possibly harmful bacteria, which may be present in the rubbish as well as leachate coming from it,” he stressed.In a study led by Professor Kamruddin Ahmed, director of Borneo Medical and Health Research Centre at Universiti Malaysia Sabah, it was revealed that urban sanitation workers were among the occupations that have a high risk of contracting leptospirosis as it required contact with waste.During his research, blood samples from 303 sanitation workers in Kota Kinabalu were tested in 2017 and 133 tested positive for leptospira, a bacterium that causes leptospirosis.In an urban setting, leptospirosis can spread to humans through rat urine in rubbish areas.At its most severe, the disease can cause kidney failure and brain damage.With this in mind, retired broker and Taman Desa resident Kenny Tan said waste companies must take a top-down approach in this matter.“Management must prioritise its ground crew’s welfare and health, and not treat it as a micro issue to be left to their supervisors to handle.“It all boils down to having checks and balances.“Having such standards in place will also reflect well on the company,” he opined.Policies in placeKDEB Waste Management (KDEBWM) general manager of operation Mohd Idris Mohamed Yusof said the SOP for sanitation workers collecting domestic solid waste was to don safety shoes and reflective vests as stipulated in the agreement with their contractors.KDEBWM, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mentri Besar Selangor Incorporated, was established to manage domestic waste collection and public cleansing services in Selangor.“The compulsory inclusion of face masks was introduced at the start of the first movement control order in March last year,” said Mohd Idris.To minimise the risk of exposure to infectious diseases among ground crew, they were to make full use of the bin lifter on refuse compactor trucks instead of holding rubbish with their hands, he added.Constant reminders to wear PPE are also given on a daily basis during morning briefings before work starts.Mohd Idris said at these briefings, workers were told that they risked being exposed to Covid-19 or other infectious diseases if the SOP was not followed.Ground crew were also required to observe physical distancing of at least one metre when dealing with the public.“A gentle reminder will be given to contractors whose workers are seen not complying with the agreed SOP.“If they continue to flout the SOP, they will be fined up to a maximum of RM500 for each offence,” he added.On medical insurance for workers in case of hospitalisation, Mohd Idris noted that there was an existing workmen’s compensation insurance providing cover for its local crew.Foreign workers come under the Foreign Workers Medical Examination Monitoring Agency (Fomema) insurance scheme, which is with their annual work permit renewals.KDEBWM also has a corporate social responsibility programme, where donations are given to crew members if accidental injuries occur in the course of their duties.Since the start of the MCO last year, the company has donated 17,000 face masks and 1,000 bottles of hand sanitiser to their subcontractors.Taking a proactive roleAccording to KDEBWM Kajang operation head Abdul Razak Abu Talib, the public has a proactive role to play when it comes to the safety of rubbish collectors.“In addition to encountering setbacks like theft and acts of vandalism of metal leach bins placed at communal rubbish collection areas, the ground crew often has two major challenges.“This includes improperly tied up rubbish bags, which result in waste spillage, and piled up rubbish, making it too heavy to be hitched onto the bin lifter.“So, the ground crew has little choice but to haul some of the rubbish bags into the compactor truck to lighten the load of the leach bin,” he explained.“They also have to pick up the scattered rubbish and this needs to be done in the shortest time possible, as trucks have to stop on narrow public roads during collection service. If the process takes too long, it causes a traffic jam.“Rushed for time, workers often resort to doing the job by hand as it is a faster solution,” he said.Another problem faced at these communal rubbish collection areas is traders also dump their rubbish there, resulting in excessive waste.Abdul Razak said commercial entities have to deal with their own waste and not throw them in these areas, which are only meant for residents.To top it off, bulk waste such as mattresses and used furniture are also disposed of at these areas, where rubbish is collected thrice weekly.“It will be helpful to the ground crew if the public can take a mindful approach to rubbish disposal.“At the very least, they should secure their waste disposal bags to prevent spillage,” he said.To ensure the safety of its ground crew, KDEBWM would be conducting regular checks on PPE usage, its media and public relations head Mahfuzah Muhammad Tarmidi told StarMetro.Likewise, Alam Flora chief executive officer Datuk Mohd Zain Hassan has also addressed this issue on its website, assuring that field staff are constantly reminded to wash their hands and use sanitisers.The wearing of PPE is also compulsory for them.Mohd Zain said steps had been taken to prevent its field staff from being infected with Covid-19.This included mandatory body temperature checks for all employees at headquarters, state offices, depots and mustering points before they start work.Those with a temperature reading exceeding 38°C would be sent for medical check-ups immediately, he added."
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Metro,MANJIT KAUR,State takes the wheel on bus service,"The Perak government is expected to make a decision tomorrow over the lack of bus service in Taiping and Kamunting.State infrastructure, energy, water and public transportation committee chairman Datuk Mohd Zolkaply Harun, when contacted, said it would find a solution for commuters relying on public buses and the matter would be decided on Wednesday at the state executive council meeting.He said the state government had the Taiping and Kamunting people’s best interest in mind even though the number of locals using public buses was fewer compared to foreign workers.“There are bus service operators who are willing to ply the routes, and are waiting for the green light from the state government.“We are settling the requirements and will make an announcement soon, ” he said, adding that the buses used would be in good working condition.Residents in Taiping and Kamunting have been restless as there has been no news of a replacement bus service after Rapid Kamunting announced it was ceasing operations by the middle of the month.Many people, especially senior citizens, depend on public buses to go to work, town or the market.They are worried that come June 15, there will be no buses on the road.Commuter Christina Ho said many were panicking as they had not received news on a new bus service to replace the Rapid buses that used to ply routes within Taiping and Kamunting.“We feel that Rapid Kamunting should continue to operate until a new bus service takes over.“We do not want to travel on the old private ‘red bus’ as they are unreliable.“In fact, we don’t even see these buses on the roads now due to the lockdown, ” she said.Recently Rapid Bus Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Prasarana Malaysia Berhad (Prasarana), announcedthat its Rapid Kamunting bus service in Perak was ceasing operations from June 15.Rapid Bus, in a statement, said the decision was due to funding constraints and low demand since the service began in 2016.A commuter, who wished to be known as Madam Choo, said Rapid Kamunting’s buses were wheelchair-friendly.“I go to the market daily with my friends and before the lockdown, we visited the lake gardens often, ” she said adding that they took the bus to these destinations.Those living in Aulong said that the Rapid Kamunting service offered convenience as it was the only public bus to ply that route.Wong Sai Mooi, 70, said it was a pity that Rapid Kamunting was stopping operations as it provided services that accommodated senior citizens.“I am hoping that the state government will be able to provide an equally good bus service to replace Rapid Kamunting, ” she said."
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Metro,LIEW JIA XIAN,The bright side of lockdown,"I WANT to go home!Under the movement control order (MCO), I am stuck in Penang while my family is back in my hometown, Ipoh.Pictures of their delicious home- cooked meals and interesting lockdown activities in our family chatgroup never fail to make me yearn for home.Thankfully, my brother managed to head home before the lockdown and be with our parents after completing his finals exam, or else he would have been stuck in Melaka.Seeing their yummy dishes has motivated me to try cooking on my own, so I asked for the recipes from my mum and brother.Let’s hope I’ll not burn down the kitchen!But the lazy person in me still depends on takeaways and deliveries.Being in a lockdown can really take a toll on people’s mental health due to the lack of human interaction and uncertain, worrying situations.Instead of focusing on the negative, I recently decided to make some ‘lockdown resolutions’ and mark things off the bucket list.Here are some of the things that I would like to achieve during the lockdown.For someone who prefers outdoor exercises such as hiking and cycling, not being able to be with nature is eating me up.I was hiking at least once a week prior to the lockdown and it was a great exercise to shed the extra pounds.For now, I can only jog around my neighbourhood or do home exercises by following fitness gurus on YouTube.Then there is my diet, which is always in a mess. But then, there is always a tomorrow when it comes to eating clean and losing weight.Inspired by one of my assistant news editors, I gave a short-term egg fast a try but failed terribly.It is funny how everything seems to be tastier when you are starting a diet. The junk food on my shelf seduces me when I walk past them every time.But still, I have decided that I should take small steps when making healthier food choices.Another inspiration from someone close to my heart has gotten me to practise meatless Fridays.Studies have shown that going meatless at least once a week is good for our health and that it lowers the risk of getting cancer.It is June now, half a year has passed; time to look back at the resolutions that I made at the beginning of the year.Small steps can really make a big difference in the long run andI believe that habits shape life. Remember the hare and tortoise story? Slow and steady wins the race.So, without pushing myself too hard, I will make conscious day-by-day efforts to cook my own food more often and eat clean.Next will be the effort to form deeper bonds and relationships.It is important to look out for each other and support friends and family. A kind gesture, a phone call or even a smile can always go a long way.I have been watching quite a few lifestyle videos on YouTube.Instead of scrolling through people’s social media and comparing myself with them, I am trying to focus more on improving myself and be thankful for the good things and kind souls in my life.As we have more time during the lockdown period, why not pick up some books to read?Reading can expand our horizon and make us wiser. It will stimulate our creativity and is a sweet escape from the drudgery of life.A few days ago, I visited a bakery in George Town and was amazed at how an undergraduate took up entrepreneurship during the first MCO.Her passion for baking was ignited and she started selling burnt cheesecakes through her social media.I was impressed by how she managed to find the light at the end of the tunnel and turn it into an opportunity to start a business during the pandemic.My social media feed has been flooded with pictures of delicious home-cooked food and desserts during the MCO and surprisingly, many of my friends are good chefs and bakers.People are staying safe at home and not travelling unnecessarily, and it turns out that cooking and baking are their escapism.I was told that cream cheese and sponge fingers were sold out during the first MCO due to the burnt cheesecake and tiramisu craze.I wonder what the trend will be this year? Come on people, show the world your creativity! I can’t wait to see what this lockdown will offer."
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Metro,R. SEKARAN,Early target for herd immunity,"IF all goes well, Penang could achieve Covid-19 herd immunity earlier than expected, with 70% or 1.38 million people, getting vaccinated by August.State health committee chairman Dr Norlela Ariffin said the present vaccination of 14,814 daily doses this month would be ramped up to 35,165 doses next month and 35,572 doses in August.She said 103,627 targeted recipients had obtained the first dose while 73,607 more recipients had obtained both doses in the state as of June 3.Dr Norlela said a comprehensive plan would be presented at the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) meeting today.“All our systems are in place to attain this. At the meeting, we will present our preparation to achieve our target.“These proposals were discussed at an earlier CITF meeting.“A lot of background work has been done and we already have a plan for the implementation,” she said.Dr Norlela said the decentralisation of vaccine administration would be key to achieving the goal.She said two more vaccine-dispensing centres (PPV) would be set up at Penang Pesta site today and Seberang Jaya expo site on June 14, while three more at Dewan Balai Rakyat Bayan Baru, Pusat Konvensyen Perda and Dewan Serbaguna Sungai Bakap were in the pipeline.She added that for now, Penang has one mega PPV at Setia SPICE Arena and five PPVs located at Caring Society Complex, Balik Pulau Sports Complex, Dewan Millenium, Dewan Serbaguna Jawi and Seberang Prai Arena Convention Centre.Norlela said PPVs had also been set up in three private hospitals yesterday.They are Lam Wah Ee Hospital, Pantai Hospital and KPJ Hospital, while another three in LohGuanLye Specialists Centre, Penang Adventist Hospital and Gleneagles Hospital are expected to begin operation on June 14.“Increasing the number of PPVs will accelerate the vaccination process.“Vaccine supply should not be an issue as the state will get two million vaccines in June and July.“The Health Ministry is supportive of our pro-active approach in the vaccination process.“They have promised to deploy trainee nurses and doctors, final-year medical students, retired nurses and hospital staff.“Administrating the vaccination dosage is not a very difficult task and most of them could be of great help in the process.“Some 500 general practitioners will be on board in the planned PPVs,” she said.Norlela said she would also propose for drive-through PPVs to be set up at Mydin Perda in Bukit Mertajam and the State Stadium in Batu Kawan.“The stadium can be used as an industrial PPV with company employees working in the zone going there for vaccination. They do not have to crowd at the existing PPVs.“The proposal also includes using parking lots of Ikea Batu Kawan, Lotus’s (formerly Tesco Extra) Seberang Jaya and several big malls as PPVs.“We have also proposed for the closed Equatorial Hotel Penang to be turned into a vaccination centre which can be used by company workers in the industrial zone.“Both the Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association and Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) are on board for the plan.“FMM has 320 small-and-medium-scale industry members who employ fewer than 1,500 people.“And with more PPVs, more of these people can be vaccinated,” she said.For large manufacturers, Norlela said on-site vaccinations would be implemented, with preparation being handled by the companies themselves.She said Penang is a small state, and should be able to achieve the targeted vaccination figures as planned.Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow had earlier said that the state was looking at achieving herd immunity by October.He said the three challenges were the number of PPVs, vaccine supply and manpower."
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Metro,N. TRISHA,Market trader compounded for SOP violation,"A TRADER at the Bukit Mertajam market, which is closed after Covid-19 cases were reported there, was slapped with compounds after he removed part of the fencing there to unload goods for his business.The market is to remain closed until tomorrow.The trader flouted the standard operating procedure (SOP) by entering the market premises on June 1 and taking down part of the fencing put up by the Seberang Prai City Council (MBSP) without the council’s permission.MBSP in a statement said they issued a compound for vandalism under the council’s Vandalism By-Law 1993, which carries a fine of not more than RM2,000 or jail term no longer than a year, or both, if found guilty and a compound under the MPSP Licence Fees By-Law 1980.“As this premises has been closed by the Ministry of Health, the trader will also be subjected to enforcement actions by the ministry, involving a compound of up to RM5,000 under Section 18(1)(d) of the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act for the offence of carrying out activities (unloading business goods) in the area or premises that has been closed.“Traders and the public are reminded to always abide by the instructions issued by the authorities in order to stop the spread of Covid-19, ” the statement read.Earlier on May 31, MBSP mayor Datuk Rozali Mohamud said sanitisation work and contact tracing at the market would be carried out while the market was closed.Rozali warned traders to comply with all SOPs and those who have been asked to take a swab test, to comply."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Metro,,"Proper safety measures in place, say recycling centres","Recycling stations run by charity organisations and social enterprises in the Klang Valley have taken precautionary measures to safeguard workers against the Covid-19 pandemic as they sort through items donated by the public.The Salvation Army public relations department senior community manager Algene Tan said steps had been put in place at its receiving warehouses.The charity’s social enterprise arm accepts pre-loved items such as clothing, electrical items, furniture, books and household items that are still in good condition to sell at its Family Thrift Stores for income.Tan said they would ensure that those entering the warehouses have their body temperature taken.“In addition to regular hand washing, they must also always wear face masks.“Thankfully, our premises is large enough to avoid overcrowding and we ensure all employees are physically distanced as they work.“If any employee feels unwell, especially if they display signs of flu, fever or cough, they will not be allowed to enter the premises.“So far, everyone understands the repercussions of flouting the standard operating procedure as most do not want to burden their own families and community by contracting the virus,” she said.Tan added that a sanitising solution was sprayed on most items.However, some things like paper do not get sprayed.“As such, we highly recommend that people clean or wipe their items upon purchase.“Our collection centres in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya arecontactless so donors can safely drop off their items at our cabins,” she said.Social enterprise Bless Shop senior operations manager Tina Chong said it had stopped accepting volunteers to help with sorting at its warehouse.Its retail shop sells pre-loved shoes and clothes in Mid Valley Megamall in Kuala Lumpur.“This is to emphasise the point that everyone should stay home to stop the spread.“Employees are also covered under our group insurance plan, so if there is ever a need for them to undergo coronavirus tests or be hospitalised, they can claim for it,” she added.However, with the lockdown currently in place, Bless and Salvation Army’s warehouses and stores are closed.At Pertubuhan Amal Seri Sinar Kuala Lumpur dan Selangor, its founder and president Datuk Eadon Ching said gloves were mandatory, especially for workers assigned to collect items deposited at the 30 collection bins placed around Klang Valley.The charity has been collecting recyclables like plastic bottles and scrap metals since 2003 to raise funds for the underprivileged.“The workers come in contact with bin door handles, which have been touched by the public.“They are also required to have water in the truck so they can wash their hands.“At the end of a working day, our sorting area is fogged with disinfectant,” he explained.The organisation’s sorting centre is still open but with only 60% manpower for segregation work and collection from its recycling bins.Visitors and in-person donation of items are not allowed at the premises for now.One message that Tan, Chong and Chin are eager to pass on to the public is to refrain from treating the recycling centres, donation bins and pick up cabins as a dumping ground for non-recyclables.“Disposable diapers, sanitary towels, face masks, tissues, carbon paper, sandpaper, paint cans, toxic liquid cans, cups, plates and bulbs are examples of non-recyclables.“Plastic bags, aluminium cans or paper and glass packaging, especially if they have been soiled by dirt or grease, should not be disposed of at such centres either,” they said. — By GRACE CHEN"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Metro,,"Speed up vaccination for disabled and caregivers, say charities","CHARITY organisations running shelters for people with disabilities (OKU) are hoping that the government will be able to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme for those in this category.According to Johor Baru Handicapped and Mentally Disabled Children Association president S. Murugaiyah, 55 out of its 214 residents have so far been registered with the Welfare Department (JKM).“Registration was done last month and we are yet to get the vaccination date,” he said.Murugaiyah said of the 214residents at the home in Taman Saleng, Indah, Kulai, only 15 were not eligible for vaccination as they were below the age of 18, and the remaining residents would be registered with JKM soon.“At the same time, only 10 out of the 55 caregivers at our shelter have already got a date for their first dose,’’ he added.Murugaiyah hopes the department will quickly provide vaccination dates for the other 45 caregivers as they are dealing with high-risk residents and those with morbidity issues.Ten of the caregivers will be receiving their first dose tomorrow at the shelter, along with 63 residents of VR Melodies Old Folks Home, which is also under the association.Separately, Murugaiyah said donations to the association had declined by 70% since the movement control order was imposed on March 18 last year.“When the economy is bad, charities like ours are among the most affected,” he lamented.The Kulai shelter, he added, needed between RM1.2mil and RM1.9mil a year to take care of 214 residents – 120 males and 94 females aged between six and 50.Murugaiyah explained that the amount was also needed to pay its 55 full-time staff, as well as for utility bills, quit rent and waste collection.Apart from Kulai, the association also has shelters for handicapped children in Banting, Selangor; Bukit Baru, Melaka; Kuantan, Pahang; and Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu.Meanwhile, Johor Area Rehabi-litation Organisation (Jaro) general manager Joseph Roy Arputham said 37 of its employees, aged between 24 to 70, had so far registered with JKM for the vaccination.“We hope to get all our employees vaccinated within the next six months,” he said, adding that JKM had agreed to conduct the vaccination programme at the complex.Joseph also said that the MCO since last year had financially impacted charity organisations.“It is a difficult time not only for charities like us but also for businesses and companies,’’ he said.Prior to the pandemic and MCO, Jaro was able to make around RM500 daily from the sale of handicrafts created by its residents and displayed at the showroom in the complex.The organisation’s average monthly income, Joseph said, had been about RM20,000 from the individual sale of handicrafts, bulk orders from companies and cash donations, but that amount has declined significantly now.“We need funds to operate and despite closing during the first MCO in March last year and the lockdown now, we still have to pay our employees,’’ he added.Jaro was set up in 1952 for tuberculosis patients, but later became a centre for the disabled."
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Metro,,Building right for a green future,"Gamuda Bhd has announced its Green Plan that sets forth tangible targets driven by environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions for over the next five years and beyond.The plan, unveiled in conjunction with World Environmental Day this year, commits the entire group to circular construction with specific steps to reduce direct and indirect corporate greenhouse gas emission intensity by 30% in 2025, and by 45% in 2030.Gamuda is building on its foundation of engineering and technology innovation, workplace safety, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and workforce diversity.This is followed by pledges to “Build Right. For Life.” in pursuing nation-building development that balances economic and social growth with a strong environmental stewardship.Over the years, it has mapped various ESG strategies across its business units to create value for the triple bottom line – profit, people and planet.The commitment is also underscored by the group’s decision in 2020 to include sustainability as a key management risk.The Gamuda Green Plan is anchored on four key pillars:Sustainable Planning and Design, Circular Construction – to facilitate sustainable master planning featuring climate-responsive design, integrated transport and super-low-energy buildings with smart features.Our Community and Our Business – to develop talent capabilities and cultivate good governance in ESG.Environmental and Biodiversity Conservation – to drive impactful efforts in nature conservation and biodiversity stewardship in its townships and property developments.Enhancing Sustainability via Digitalisation – to leverage on technology and data management to enhance Group-wide efforts in sustainable development.The “living” document will evolve and realign with policies over time, taking account of latest technological developments and current stakeholder demands.Gamuda Group managing director Datuk Lin Yun Ling said the Green Plan was its commitment to value, mitigate and adapt to climate change.“We must own it and hold with very deep conviction to walk the talk.“By taking a whole-of-group approach, we are empowering our own people to pursue these goals with a structured plan.“By addressing climate change, we are making an effort to leave a positive legacy for our future generations. There’s no alternative, ” he added.As a key feature of the plan,bold targets have been listed for Gamuda’s landmark project, Penang South Islands (PSI).It aims to achieve an overall 50% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, which will play a significant role in transitioning to a low-carbon future.PSI’s Green Tech Park is designed to be 100% powered by renewable energy, posing as a promising hub for emerging low-carbon technologies and enabling decarbonisation at scale.Gamuda Green Plan also outlines various initiatives for its townships to reach 40% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.These include 35% reduction in urban planning emissions with sustainable master planning, 10% reduction in transport emissions through green mobility plans and low carbon commuting networks, 40% reduction in non-renewable energy use, 65% reduction in freshwater demand and 50% reduction in landfill waste in closing the waste loop.Yayasan Gamuda will scale up the group’s community investment efforts through programmes such as Enabling Academy and Gamuda Scholarship.Gamuda Parks will intensify its biodiversity conservation by establishing a wetlands arboretum with a forest seed bank for native species, as well as developing internal capabilities in the areas of arboriculture and horticulture by partnerships with the indigenous community.Gamuda will also nurture and plant one million trees and saplings through its Advance Tree Planting scheme as part of this initiative.To accelerate progress towards the ambitious targets, the group will fully adopt Digital Industria-lised Building System (IBS) across all its developments, together with other industry players, aligning to the circular construction framework.Lin said Digital IBS was capable of delivering a wide range of construction products through cloud-based Building Information Modelling design models, integrated with precise robotic production.This, he said, would reduce Gamuda’s reliance on foreign workforce and generate less waste – these are key elements of ESG.“Hence, it’s imperative that we increase our productivity and upskill the local workforce and supply chain to enhance sustainability through digital construction, ” he added."
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,"As aid dries up, Baba is back at his dhaba","On a hot May afternoon, Kanta Prasad and his wife Badaami Devi make for a picture of despair as they wait for customers at Baba ka Dhaba, a nondescript roadside eatery in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar. The sight is a far cry from just a few months ago when a social media campaign, which saw help pouring in from across the country, seemed poised to end their troubles.Prasad and his dhaba had become famous overnight last year after a city YouTuber shared a video showing the octogenarian Prasad in tears, telling him how he struggled to make ends meet as business dried up.The viral video led to thousands of people making a beeline to the couple's eatery for food, selfies and donating money.Soon, he opened a new restaurant, added a new floor to his house, settled his old debts and bought smartphones for himself and his children. However, life has since come a full circle, as the new restaurant closed in February and Prasad and his wife are now back at their old dabha where the sales, which saw a 10-fold jump after the initial YouTube video in October, have slumped drastically over the past few months.Prasad said the fourth Covid-19 wave in Delhi, which forced the closure of their old dhaba for 17 days and further affected the sales, have led them to penury – again.""The daily footfalls at our dhaba have declined because of the ongoing Covid lockdown, and our daily sales have come down from Rs3,500 (RM198) before the lockdown to Rs1,000 (RM56.60) now. The income is not sufficient for our family of eight,"" said a dejected Prasad, as he waited for customers.There are some signs from his glory days. The old dhaba, that looked like a portacabin, now has three CCTV cameras and the live footage can be accessed on Prasad's smartphone. And a fancy board atop displays the dhaba's name, the year it was established, photographs of the elderly couple, two mobile numbers, and proclaims Indian and Chinese menu for lunch and dinner. However, the dhaba currently serves only Indian food such as rice, pulses, and two types of vegetables – the same menu that the couple had at their dhaba before the viral video earned them fame – for lunch and it closes before dinner.Prasad had opened his new restaurant with much fanfare on a cold December morning and for the first few days, it was a roaring success. Unlike at the dhaba where Prasad rolled out rotis for his customers, he and his wife and their two sons sat behind a new gleaming counter, collecting payments as his employees – two cooks and waiters – flitted about serving customers. For a while, it seemed the octogenarian's pains were a thing of the past.After the initial frenzy, customers, however, started disappearing slowly and soon, the expenses were more than the income.Prasad said he invested Rs5 lakh (RM28,300) in the restaurant and hired three workers. The monthly expenditure was around Rs1 lakh (RM5,661) – Rs35,000 (RM1,981) towards rent; Rs36,000 (RM2,037) to pay salaries of three employees; and Rs15,000 (RM849) for electricity and water bills, and to procure food ingredients.""But the average monthly sales never crossed Rs40,000 (RM2,264). I had to bear all the losses. In hindsight, I feel we were wrongly advised to open a new restaurant,"" he said.The new enterprise collapsed in three months.""Of the total investment of Rs5 lakh, we managed to recover only Rs36,000 from the sale of chairs, utensils, and cooking machines, after the restaurant shut down,"" said Prasad, blaming Tushant Adlakha, a social worker who, he said, had encouraged and helped him to open the new restaurant at a rented place.""Essentially it was he (Adlakha) and his team who managed and supervised everything, including the investment and sales. He said he would make it a success, but he never gave enough time for the restaurant,"" said Prasad.But Adlakha denied the allegations and blames Prasad and his two sons for the new restaurant's failure.""From setting up the restaurant to bringing customers and orders for home delivery of food, we did everything. What else could we do? Prasad's two sons took charge of the restaurant, but they hardly ever stayed at the counter. There were enough orders for home delivery, but the two failed to deliver them,"" he said.In November, Prasad had filed a cheating case against YouTuber Gaurav Wasan, who had shot the viral video of the octogenarian's plight. Prasad alleged that Wasan had collected large sums of money from good Samaritans, but handed him only a small part of it.Wasan denied the allegations and claimed that he gave to Prasad all the donations he had received. Prasad's allegations against the YouTuber polarised opinion on social media, with many saying that he was unfairly targeting his benefactor.Wasan said he held no grudge but was hurt by Prasad's allegation questioning his selfless motive.""I was heartbroken and was mentally stressed for a couple of months, as the allegations had affected my reputation. Baba has since called me a few times on my mobile phone but I never responded. I have moved on,"" said Wasan.Prasad and his wife, on the other hand, claimed that they still do not know how much money was collected from the people by Wasan. A senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said,""The investigation into the case is still on.""Prasad's wife Badaami Devi said they are back to square one. ""All our money is gone. Our children are unemployed and we are old and cannot run the dabha anymore. We hope the government will help us in some way,"" she said, as Prasad nodded in agreement.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) senior leader Somnath Bharti, who is also the MLA from Malviya Nagar, attributed Prasad's failure to multiple reasons, including his inexperience in handling fame and success, and managing the financial assistance and resources he got through various channels.""I personally believe that there should be a proper system in place when it comes to helping people like Prasad. Expecting an old man like him to start a new business is always risky as there will be people who would try to get benefits out of their situation and circumstances. That's why I feel that help should come through a proper channel and the objective is to help such people grow. I had also offered to help Prasad and I am still available – both in my personal capacity and through the Delhi government,"" said Bharti. – Hindustan Times, New Delhi/Tribune News Service"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Eating a cold dish could increase your calorie intake,"Our perception of calorie content can be distorted by the temperature of a dish, whether warm or cold.This could lead us to eat more.According to a study from France, our brain perceives a cold dish to be lighter in calories than a warm dish.The majority of people who choose a cold dish tend to consume more calories (+31%), fat (+37%) and carbohydrates (+22%).But how can this unconscious decision made by our brain be explained?To answer this question, three researchers from Grenoble Ecole de Management conducted a survey of 2,600 French, American and Brazilian adults of all ages.One of the study’s authors, Amanda Pruski Yamim, offered a first element of explanation for this observation in a press release.“In most cultures, warm foods are considered filling and play an important role in the day’s main meals.“This perception comes from the fact that humans digest hot foods more easily and expect warm food to be tastier,” she outlines.And so for a tastier meal, we are willing to pay more.The study reports that survey participants would be willing to pay up to 25% more for a food item when it was served (or simply labelled) hot.“These observations are essential for people with weight problems or suffering from obesity,” says the researcher, who advises adding a warm food item to a cold dish to increase the feeling of satiety. – AFP Relaxnews"

Maybe it's because there are many things I miss...

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,"After being featured in 'One Good Thing', volunteers keep on giving","For more than a year, The Associated Press has been bringing us “One Good Thing” – stories highlighting good deeds done by individuals to brighten others’ days during trying times.Usually, their stories don’t end there. They keep volunteering their time, energy and resources to help people in need, even if their own lives were also turned upside down by a pandemic that has killed and sickened millions around the world. Sometimes they’ve received recognition for their service, or seen support and donations roll in as a result of the publicity.Recently, we checked in with several of those heroes and updated their stories.In February, we brought you the story of Bonifaz Díaz. He biked in and around the Guatemalan highlands city of Quetzaltenango with his saddlebags filled with donated books to barter for an oatmeal-like cereal mix, Incaparina, that an NGO was using to feed nearly 400 children in need.Díaz is still covering around 150km per week in the city at a lung-busting 2,330m above sea level. Mostly, he makes his trips in the morning because it’s the rainy season and storms typically roll in in the afternoon. He figures he collects about 36kg of Incaparina a week, enough to keep the malnutrition programme going.Díaz had worried that the barter donations could dry up as pandemic lockdowns eased in the country, but the opposite turned out to be the case: Donor interest has surged, three other cyclists have joined him since February, and a local cycle shop is now doing maintenance on their bikes for free.“My fear was that once they started being less afraid (of the coronavirus), people wouldn’t feel as committed, ” Díaz said. “But the project has been getting stronger because people participate.”Even as he hopes to return to work in the coming weeks at the theatre company he co-founded – shut down for more than a year due to the pandemic – he intends to keep the barter project up and running.“I feel that there’s reason for it to exist even without the pandemic, ” Díaz said. “The problem of child malnutrition is always latent.”Flourishing food pantryDespite her own coronavirus-related struggles, including a lost job and overdue rent on her martial arts studio, Sofia Moncayo spearheaded a New York City food distribution programme as it ballooned to serve hundreds of people suddenly struggling to stave off hunger.After the AP’s story was published three months ago, more people came forward wanting to support the project, organised through the Mosaic West Queens church and community centre, Moncayo said recently by email.Touring musicians David Shenton and Erin Shields, the subjects of another story, assembled a cast of Broadway stars and celebrities for a benefit concert that raised about US$6,000 (RM24,735) for the pantry in a single evening, Moncayo said.The Kelly Clarkson Show donated US$5,000 (RM20,612) for the pantry and also paid for Moncayo, Shields and another volunteer to go on an upcoming vacation to the Bahamas in appreciation for their efforts. And LaGuardia Community College invited Moncayo to speak at 2021 commencement ceremonies.Moncayo said that with a federal farm-to-families food programme ending this month, the pantry is looking to boost its US$20,000 (RM82,450) monthly budget to US$30,000 (RM123,675) to keep up with demand.“The work at the food pantry continues, ” she wrote, “and our fundraising efforts are more important than ever.”Flying for a causeTJ Kim, a high school junior and aviator living in McLean, Virginia, was recognised as one of 10 noted youth volunteers in the country. His accomplishment: after-school missions flying more than 90,000 items of gloves, masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment to 20 rural hospitals in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia.The distinction – awarded during a virtual celebration last month – came with a US$7,500 (RM30,919) scholarship and a US$5,000 (RM20,612) grant to a nonprofit of Kim’s choice. With India in crisis as the world’s pandemic epicentre, he plans to give the grant to an organisation doing Covid-19 relief work in the South Asian nation.Kim devised Operation Supplies Over the Skies, or Operation SOS, as a way to help the community and keep himself active after his lacrosse season was shut down. The response he got from hospital staffers was rewarding, and he plans to continue making deliveries even after the pandemic eases or ends altogether.“I’ve always said from the beginning that as long as there’s a need, ” Kim said, “I’m going to keep flying.” – AP"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",8:05 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Qatar prepares traditional dhow boats in time for 2022 World Cup,"A fleet of 40 traditional dhow boats are being renovated for tourists in Qatar as the country prepares to host the 2022 World Cup.The excursion boats once used for pearl diving, fishing and transporting goods are to take off from the Doha’s central Dhow Harbour, today a key landmark of the Qatari capital marked by a prominent clamshell monument.The country’s tourism authority says the restorations, set to be ready by October 2021, will preserve the boats’ authentic traditional exteriors while adding facilities for a more fun trip out on the water and solar power to replace fuel.The city also wants to modernise its harbours and jetties as part of major efforts to spruce up its infrastructure for the expected onslaught of visitors during the 2022 FIFA World Cup football tournament.Traffic on the Corniche waterfront promenade leading from the harbour, and at other popular locations in Doha, is notoriously congested. But Qatar has also been building a new metro system especially for the football world’s biggest event.Five of the eight stadiums being used for the tournament will be reachable on the new network. Two of the stadiums have already opened.FIFA has been trumpeting the fact that none of the stadiums are more than 55km apart, making it possible for fans to attend two matches in one day.FIFA has also confirmed that there will be designated fan zones during the tournament. And possibly the most important detail for football fans: alcohol will be served inside these zones.Since about 80% of hotel rooms will be occupied by FIFA during the tournament, Qatar will be laying on cruise ships, among other things, for tourists to sleep in. There will even be the option of sleeping in the desert – or if that sounds a bit extreme, you can always go there on a day trip instead.Qatar’s announcements of new tourist infrastructure have been marred by human rights issues surrounding the conditions of migrant workers during construction work ahead of next year’s world cup.British newspaper The Guardian has said that 6,500 migrant workers from five Asian countries have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010.There have been calls to boycott the Qatar World Cup while the host nation has said reforms have taken place and the deaths are not excessive given the size of the workforce from those countries. – dpa"

""This is a place I’m staying.”Ai’s show in São Paulo in 2018 covered twice the area of the Lisbon exhibit but had fewer works on display.Rapture is being presented in a long, low, riverside building that housed Portugal’s national rope factory starting in the 18th century and now hosts temporary art exhibitions. Ai’s show runs until Nov 28.The 85 pieces include some of Ai’s iconic works, as well as new ones produced exclusively in Portugal.Forever Bicycles from 2015, a giant sculpture using 960 stainless steel bicycles as building blocks, stands at the entrance to the building. Ai's 16m-long black inflatable boat with human figures, which alludes to the migration crisis, is also in Lisbon, as are some other of his well-known installations, sculptures, videos and photographs.Ai notes, however, that most of the works ""have never met each other” and are appearing in the same place for the first time.Ai was arrested at Beijing’s airport in April 2011 and held for 81 days without explanation during a wider crackdown on dissent. He moved to Europe after Chinese authorities returned his passport.He has travelled across Portugal visiting craftspeople and manufacturers who use traditional Portuguese methods and materials such as marble, textiles, hand-painted tiles and cork.His experimentation has yielded a self-portrait sculpture in cork, a cut-out world map in fabric that stands about 1.5m high, a 40-long rug, and a marble cylinder almost 2m high.Marcello Dantas, the show’s Brazilian curator, says that Ai arrived in Portugal for the first time in 2019 on a flight that landed at 8am. By lunchtime, he had bought a house near the farming town of Montemor-o-Novo, about 100km southeast of Lisbon""I always make decisions by my personal instinct, ” Ai said. ""I feel comfortable here.”The artist ticks off what appeals to him about the country: the relatively slow pace of life, the ""very open” people, the ""very acceptable” food and the abundant sunshine.Ai says the limits on movement during the Covid-19 pandemic furnished him with ""a most productive time.”Over the past year or so, he made three feature-length films in addition to art pieces. He has a book coming out later this year and another exhibition planned for this summer in the northern Portuguese city of Porto.Remaining in Portugal was ""probably the best decision I ever made, ” he says. - AP"

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",6:06 PM MYT,Tech,STEPHEN NELLIS,"Apple adds virtual IDs on iPhone, video plans that rival Zoom, Teams","(Reuters) - Apple Inc, facing accusations from rivals that it has too much control over its App Store, on Monday outlined plans to increase user privacy and keep consumer data out of other companies' hands, laying out features including expanded video conferencing and storing virtual government IDs on iPhones.The changes came at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference for software developers, some of whom have started to complain about Apple's grip over which apps can appear on its devices, as well as its 15% to 30% commissions on digital sales.Many of the new features allow users to safeguard data, trusting the information to the Apple brand. Users will be able to scan ID cards in participating U.S. states, and the cards will be encrypted in a user's digital wallet, along with credit cards and transit cards in some U.S. cities. It is working with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration to accept the digital IDs at airports.In many cases, Apple itself cannot see all the information. The company has updated the paid version of its iCloud storage service to include a service that obscures a user's Web-browsing habits, even from Apple. Another new iCloud feature will let users hide their real email address, which has become increasingly used as an identifier for digital marketers to track users. Apple said iCloud pricing will not change with the new features.Apple also tweaked some of its apps and services in ways that could intensify its rivalries with Zoom Video Communications Inc and Microsoft Corp's Teams, both of which gained prominence during the pandemic.It updated its FaceTime video chat app to allow scheduling calls with multiple attendees and making the software compatible with Android and Windows devices.Apple also introduced what it calls in-app events, a way for developers to host live events within apps and have those events featured in real time in the App Store. Video game developers, for example, could host live tournaments and market those on the App Store, which Apple's current systems are not built to handle.The move could intensify competition with Facebook Inc, which on Monday said it was planning to launch an online events business that would be free until 2023 and thereafter will charge commissions lower than Apple's 30% fees for the App Store.Several of the other features Apple introduced Monday, such as the ability to snap a photo of a sign and use artificial intelligence to pluck out the written text, have been present on the rival Android operating system for several years.The rest of Apple's conference is dedicated to technical sessions for developers, some of whom have bristled at its controls and fees.Those issues have come under regulatory scrutiny and are at the heart of an antitrust lawsuit brought by ""Fortnite"" creator Epic Games, in which a federal judge is considering how to rule.Apple has said its App Store practices increase the market for mobile software by creating an environment for paid apps that consumers trust, and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook and his team did not address frayed developer relations during the presentation.Not all developers have negative sentiments, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive at Creative Strategies, who has been surveying Apple developers and found more than 90% have no plans to stop making apps for Apple devices.However, some complaints are widespread, with more than half of developers saying fees should be capped at 10%, and many wanting more clarity around reasons for rejecting apps from the App Store and how to resolve such issues, Bajarin said.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Peter Henderson, Aurora Ellis, Nick Zieminski and Jonathan Oatis)"

The changes stem in part from the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement - which has prompted vendors and customers alike to think beyond the needs of a white, English-speaking audience - and the pandemic, which created a large ""remote"" workforce heavily dependent on technology.Alphabet Inc's Google this month plans to deploy an artificial intelligence (AI) feature that addresses the longstanding issue of darker skin tones being under-illuminated in video chats.Cisco Systems Inc in January launched a gesture-recognition feature to display a thumbs-up in Webex, taking pains to assure that skin tones would not affect performance. LogMeIn Inc's GoToMeeting, Microsoft Corp's Teams and Facebook Inc's Workplace are adding translation or pronunciation options in what they describe as an equity push.""Technology is fundamentally today just not as inclusive as you want it to be,"" said Jeetu Patel, senior vice president and general manager for Cisco security and collaboration. Setting ""values and principles that a product should stand for"" has become essential, he said.The tech industry has long been under fire for a poor record on workplace diversity and a failure to recognize the ways in which product design can perpetuate discrimination.Worries about bias in video conferencing picked up last September after Colin Madland, a doctoral student at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, tweeted a screenshot https://twitter.com/colinmadland/status/1307111818981146626 of a Black colleague appearing headless when deploying a virtual background on Zoom.Studies of other AI cropping systems have shown they generate more errors with darker skin, in part because the data used to train them mostly included lighter examples.Zoom's chief diversity officer, Damien Hooper-Campbell, told Reuters: ""Bias was not at play, but rather a combination of the user's distance from the camera, use of headphones, and seating position.""Madland said the problem subsided after his colleague purchased a green screen and some ""snazzy lighting.""For Zoom and its rivals, delivering on inclusion could provide an edge while vying for post-pandemic deals with clients - which are facing their own reckonings on diversity.Global spending on cloud-based conferencing is forecast to reach $5.41 billion this year, up from $5.02 billion in 2020, according to tech consultancy Gartner. It does not track market share, but analysts cite Zoom and Cisco as the leaders.'NOT EQUALLY REPRESENTED'The upcoming Google Meet feature tackles the problem of people appearing darker because of their surroundings, for example when sitting in front of a window, said Niklas Blum, a Google product leader involved with Meet.""Users with dark skin tones are not equally represented, and we want to build products for everyone,"" he said.The AI separates users from their background, determines whether they are underexposed regardless of their skin tone, brightens the picture accordingly, and finally merges the background and foreground.Meet's virtual waiting room will prompt users to activate the lighting adjustment when it detects they could benefit from it, said Stéphane Hulaud, product lead for video quality and processing in Meet.Blum and Hulaud said Meet first identified the representation issues in video when launching a low-light enhancement for mobile calls well before the pandemic. Developing the latest feature took considerable time, but it led Meet to establish product inclusion testing procedures and mandate them for all of its work.Google is pursuing additional fixes, too. Meet is pitching laptop makers and operating systems on sharing greater control over cameras' white balance and exposure. Internally, Google adopted minimum light reflectiveness requirements for conference room designs.At Cisco, the new gesture-recognition option, when turned on, lets users hold up their thumb on camera for about a second to generate a virtual thumbs-up on screen.Cisco trained its AI to focus on the shape outline and movement of the gesture in time and space, reducing potential issues from variance in skin tone, said Keith Griffin, a distinguished engineer at the company.Praying hands - for ""thank you"" - are among possible new gesture options to come, with a feature that interprets sign language an eventual goal. Webex also expects to add skin-tone options beyond yellow for the icons.Mike Sharp, LogMeIn's chief product officer for unified communications and collaboration, said education clients have driven some of the company's ""inclusion"" updates.For instance, forthcoming support for Spanish, Mandarin and other languages in voicemail prompts and transcriptions will benefit an unidentified California school district that wanted to better engage with its community, Sharp said.Facebook Workplace, a suite of business communication tools, last month said video town hall hosts soon would see name pronunciations for workers posing written questions.Product head Ujjwal Singh said the pointers, which are AI-generated but editable, aimed to help executives at clients including Nestle SA and Booking Holdings Inc properly address colleagues and promote inclusion.""I don’t want to mispronounce it to thousands of employees and look like I'm not in touch with the company,"" he said.(Reporting by Paresh Dave in Oakland, Calif.; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Matthew Lewis)"

Discussion site Reddit banned the forum last year, saying it encouraged violence against public officials.Nineteen of the accounts on the renamed Patriots.win site were created in three hours last Nov. 5, two days after the presidential election, Graphika said, and have amplified Republican Trump's false claims of vote rigging. http://www.graphika.com/patriotsThe accounts also posted cartoons and comments that falsely accuse President Joe Biden, a Democrat, of pedophilia and senility. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the postings.Graphika said 16 times in March and April, Patriots.win accounts posted the same cartoons as accounts the firm was already tracking on Gab, a site popular with white supremacists. Neither Gab's top executive nor a group of Patriots.win moderators responded to Reuters questions about the accounts.Identical postings from Patriots.win and Gab were still visible last week, though Reuters could not independently establish they were posted by the same people.The Gab accounts previously promoted a site called the Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens (NAEBC), which Facebook experts said was associated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian government contractor.The activities of the accounts shows that they are acting in close coordination with known IRA disinformation operations, Graphika said. The postings typically occurred within an hour on both Patriots.net and Gab networks, Graphika said.The contractor was indicted in 2018 by U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller for interfering in the 2016 election; it has not entered a plea and has reorganized since then.

"Monday, 07 Jun 2021",4:56 PM MYT,Tech,MATHIEU ROSEMAIN,Google to change global advertising practices in landmark antitrust deal,"PARIS (Reuters) -Google said it would make changes to its global advertising business to ensure it did not abuse its dominance, bowing to antitrust pressure for the first time in a landmark settlement with French authorities.The deal with the French competition watchdog could help rebalance the power over advertising in favour of publishers, which held sway over the business in the pre-internet era but lost control with the rapid rise of Google and Facebook.The settlement, announced on Monday and included a fine on of 220 million euros ($268 million), was the first time the U.S. tech giant had agreed to make changes to its ads business, which brings in the bulk of its revenue.""The decision to sanction Google is of particular significance because it's the first decision in the world focusing on the complex algorithmic auction processes on which the online ad business relies,"" said France's antitrust chief Isabelle de Silva.The French settlement alone may not meaningfully affect industry market share, according to ad-supported media companies and Google's advertising rivals. But they hope it inspires similar antitrust cases in the United States and other jurisdictions.""This decision is a key milestone to re-energize competition and innovation in the ad tech space, and publishers, who are the primary victims of Google practices, will ultimately benefit from it, but the battle is only beginning,"" said Arnaud Creput, chief executive of Smart, which provides ad tech to publishers.France's case did not address, for example, Google's control of its dominant search and YouTube properties to thwart competition. It also did not discuss user privacy curbs Google is to introduce on the web that could benefit it at the expense of competitors.Instead, the watchdog focused on the ties between Google Ad Manager, used by publishers to auction ad space, and Google AdX, one of several marketplaces which can manage auctions.Google grew market share of both services by sharing strategic data across them and barring them from operating as smoothly with rival systems, the authority said.The privileged relationship ""deprived"" publishers from benefiting from potential industry competition, it said.Under the terms of the settlement, Google committed for three years to level the playing field better for AdX with an independent trustee monitoring the situation, the French watchdog said. Some changes would be implemented by the first quarter of 2022, it said, adding that Google would not appeal the decision.""We will be testing and developing these changes over the coming months before rolling them out more broadly, including some globally,"" the company added.'RIGHTLY SANCTIONED'The ad practices of tech giants, whose success relies on the trove of data they have amassed over the years, have infuriated many publishers globally. The French antitrust authority said its decision opened the way for publishers who felt disadvantaged to seek damages from Google.Most of Google's sales come from search and YouTube ads. But last year about $23 billion was tied to helping publishers sell ads, drawing antitrust scrutiny to the connections between Google's businesses, plus calls from some critics to break up the company.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire welcomed the watchdog decision.""The practices put in place by Google to favour its own advertising technologies have affected press groups, whose business model is heavily dependent on ad revenues,"" he said.""These are serious practices and they have been rightly sanctioned.""It launched its investigation in 2019 following a complaint from News Corp, French news publishing group Le Figaro and Belgian press group Rossel.News Corp struck a global news deal with Google in February, one of the most extensive deals of its kind with big tech.""We haven't been involved in the case in France since we concluded our deal with Google in February, but we remain pleased by the progress of our global partnership, and are hopeful for a long and fruitful relationship in the years ahead,"" a News Corp spokesman said.Groupe Le Figaro declined to comment while Rossel did not respond to a request for comment.($1 = 0.8225 euro)(Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain; Additional reporting by Helen Coster and Paresh Dave; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Christian Lowe and Pravin Char)"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",10:32 AM MYT,News,RENJU JOSE,Australia's Melbourne eyes way out of COVID-19 lockdown as cases ease,"SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's Victoria state authorities said plans to ease COVID-19 restrictions in state capital, Melbourne, this week remained ""on track"" as new locally acquired coronavirus cases declined on Tuesday.Victoria, Australia's second-most-populous state, was plunged into a one-week lockdown on May 27 to contain a virus outbreak, forcing its 7 million residents to remain home except for essential business.The lockdown was extended in Melbourne until June 10, while some restrictions were relaxed in other regions in the state.Two new locally acquired cases, both linked to existing clusters, were reported on Tuesday, down from 11 a day earlier.""While we never want to see new cases, it is reassuring that we are again seeing these cases with clear links to existing outbreaks,"" Victoria state Acting Premier James Merlino told reporters in Melbourne.Merlino said contact tracers have linked the source of the highly infectious Delta virus variant to an overseas traveller who entered hotel quarantine in Melbourne on May 8.But officials said that it was still unclear how the Delta variant was transmitted into the community and that further tests would be needed.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he would like to see the COVID-19 lockdown in Melbourne lifted as early as possible and urged authorities to balance risks when they decide to shut down large parts of the economy.""Further restrictions around the country should either not occur at all, or for a very, very narrow set of circumstances,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney.Australia has reported zero local cases for most days this year, encouraging authorities to ease restrictions helping the country's A$2 trillion ($1.55 trillion) economy rebound sharply to above pre-pandemic levels.DELTA VARIANTThough case numbers remained in single digits on almost all days through the lockdown, the emergence of the highly contagious Delta variant, first detected in India, late last week had stoked concerns of a major spike in infections.The Delta variant has been classified by the World Health Organization as among the four COVID-19 variants of concern because of evidence that it spreads more easily, and that it most likely caused the latest devastating wave of COVID-19 in India.Australia has fared better than many other developed countries in containing COVID-19, largely with snap lockdowns, regional border restrictions and tough social distancing rules. It has reported just under 30,200 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began.The latest outbreak has spurred a surge in people getting inoculated across Australia as federal, state and territory governments look to step up the pace of a sluggish nationwide vaccination drive.New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, on Tuesday said it would build a second mass vaccination hub while South Australia extended its rollout to include people in their 40s. The Northern Territory has made vaccines eligible for anyone older than 16.About 20% of Australia's adult population has received a first vaccine dose, with about 5.1 million total shots administered so far.($1 = 1.2905 Australian dollars)(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Gerry Doyle)"

We should not make the Olympics (an occasion) to spread the virus to these countries,"" he added, noting most countries lack vaccines.Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on July 23 despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources.Japan has not suffered the explosive outbreak seen elsewhere but has recorded nearly 760,000 cases and more than 13,500 deaths. Tokyo and other regions are under a state of emergency after a fourth wave hit, straining hospitals.The government's top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, said last week medical experts planned a statement on the Games by June 20, when the state of emergency is set to be lifted.A labour union in the northern island of Hokkaido, where the Olympic marathon will be held, petitioned its governor on Monday calling for the Games to be cancelled, media said.Japanese Olympic Committee board member Kaori Yamaguchi, a judo bronze medallist at the 1988 Games, said on Friday Japan had been ""cornered"" into pressing ahead with the Games.Japan's public remains divided about holding the Games, although opposition appears to be easing somewhat.

But this also depends on the shipping time, which may take longer,"" said Zhang.Many ships are waiting to dock at the port, and some are choosing other ports. The nearby Shekou Port is also congested because of the influx of many cargo ships, said Zhang, adding that goods and people on ships need to be screened for epidemic prevention.Zhang Manfeng, assistant director of the Guangdong Shoe Manufacturers Chamber of Commerce, said that shoe exporters face longer shipping times and higher rates.""What normally takes one day to be loaded on ships now takes about a week,"" said Zhang, noting that the container price is also at least 20 per cent higher.The port congestion is the result of tight anti-epidemic measures amid surging local Covid-19 cases.Three newly imported confirmed cases and ten imported asymptomatic cases were reported across the province on Sunday. As of midnight on Sunday, 2,542 confirmed cases of Covid-19 had been reported in the province, including 1,052 imported cases, according to the Health Commission of Guangdong Province.Despite the long waiting times, traders and producers said that they understand the necessity of epidemic prevention.""It's not easy for China to prevent a new epidemic - it's the only country that has been able to do so. This is the reason why we will be able to resume full production and deliver much-needed products to our global clients,"" said Zhang.The shoe association has been talking with clients abroad and most of them are willing to accept longer delivery times.To keep things moving and ensure epidemic prevention, Yantian port's official account issued a new order on Saturday saying that anyone who wants to enter the port must book in advance.Guangdong is improving coordination of prevention and control work at ports, including Covid-19 vaccinations for all workers at international ports and terminals before June 3, a government report said. Staff at all terminals must also undergo regular nucleic acid tests.Such measures have helped to ease crowdedness at the port and ensure safety, according to businesses.""The backlog has been alleviated after the regulations were put in place,"" a trader surnamed Peng with Shenzhen Ruicheng Logistics, told the Global Times on Sunday.However, industry insiders said that given the ongoing global epidemic, ports will be under pressure for some time.What happened at Yantian port is often seen in other countries, where epidemic prevention has disrupted logistics, Kang Shuchun, a director of the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, told the Global Times on Sunday.What happened at Yantian is expected to have a temporary and limited impact on the global supply chain, Kang said. But what is really hurting companies are the high freight rates that have lasted since the second half of last year.""Due to the epidemic conditions in some other countries, containers that leave China can't come back on time,"" said Kang.Sea shipping accounts for more than 90 per cent of China's foreign trade, public data show. Joint efforts worldwide are needed in order to tackle this global shipping crisis, analysts said.""The export season for Christmas items normally comes around August and September, and if the container shortage is not resolved, this will be a real problem for the global supply chain,"" said Kang. - Global Times"

And how this concept links the Belt and the Road to South-east Asia and beyond, ” he said, describing this an area for “fertile discussion with much to look forward to”.The ILSTC is a logistics network centred on Chongqing, linking China to South-east Asia, along with key nodes in the western provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, Gansu, Qinghai and Xinjiang.During a bilateral meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the main event, Dr Balakrisnan said Singapore is willing to play an important role in the ILSTC to “jointly promote regional and world economic recovery”, according to a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Wang said both countries need to continue the momentum of high-level exchanges in a flexible manner, the statement reported, and jointly explore more ways to improve economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges during the pandemic.In the 30 years since China was invited to be an Asean dialogue partner, Singapore has played an important role in deepening Beijing's relations with the grouping, said Wang.Noting that this is a significant occasion, marking three decades of diplomatic ties between China and Asean, Dr Balakrishnan said the relationship had seen its ups and downs.But he added: “This was an occasion to reflect on successes, as well as to assess how we move forward, and move forward with the challenges that confront China and Asean.” - The Straits Times/Asia News"

Shanghai, Seoul, Wellington, Taipei and Manila were all up but off their initial highs.Analysts said there was little reaction to news that G7 finance ministers had endorsed a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15 per cent, with their focus on tech giants and other multinationals.""The reality is that this was well flagged as much as a fortnight ago (soon after President Biden publicly endorsed the 15 per cent figure),"" said National Australia Bank's Ray Attrill.""Plus there is awareness there is still a long way to go before a deal is inked at the broader G20 -- or much broader OECD -- levels and where the likes of Ireland with its 10 per cent tax rate may yet prove to be a thorn in the side of securing a global agreement.""He added that acceptance of the levy could even be seen as a ""result"" if it meant an end to Biden's plan for a hike in corporation tax from 21 per cent to 28 per cent."

Alan Peter Cayetano told reporters on Monday (June 7).Cayetano, who was Duterte’s running mate in the 2016 national elections, said that the president’s “legacy” might be affected if he would decide to run for the second- highest government post in next year’s elections.“If I were asked personally, for example, if I were beside him right now and he would ask: Alan, what do you think? I will tell him: ‘Boss, you became one of the best presidents. Your legacy might be hit, and there are many other issues. You know, whoever becomes the next president, even if its [Vice President Leni Robedo, ” she will consult with you. So just be the elder statesman, ’” Cayetano said, speaking partly in Filipino.“Look at President Ramos. Not everyone agrees with him. To be frank, he wasn’t the most exciting politician. But then he became an elder statesman, ” the former House speaker added.Cayetano stressed, however, that it would still be a decision for Duterte to make.“It’s he who has to decide, not me. But that’s my view. It’s also affected. And what if the one he endorses as president will not win? So they will quarrel. This time around he will have no power for six years. He will just be waiting. If anything happens to the president, he might be blamed for it, ” Cayetano said.Duterte’s name floated as a possible vice presidential candidate after the ruling Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) adopted a resolution seeking to convince him to run for the post in the 2022 polls.Cayetano, for his part, earlier bared that he was “seriously considering” running for the presidential or other posts. - Philippine Daily Inquirer/Asia News Network"

Officials reported 2,419 new Covid-19 cases and 33 deaths yesterday, bringing the total to 179,886 cases and 1,269 fatalities.“My feeling is that no matter what, we will need to go outside of our homes for the littlest things, so getting the vaccine gives us a sense of relief, ” said Praepawee Lertpongkijja, 38, at a vaccination centre.The government has been scrambling to source more vaccines as concerns emerged about the production capacity of royal-owned Siam Bioscience, the company making the AstraZeneca vaccine locally, after the Philippines said its order had been reduced and delayed.Thailand will receive 3.24 million more doses from AstraZeneca after mid-June, the health ministry said.Thailand received 1.8 million locally-produced AstraZeneca shots on Friday and has sourced another 200,000 doses from South Korea, a health ministry source said.The country expects to sign a contract this week for 20 million shots of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. — Reuters"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Asean+,,Blood test to detect cancer and treatment efficacy,"Researchers have developed a blood test which will not only allow doctors to determine the effectiveness of cancer treatment within 24 hours, but also detect the disease in annual check-ups.Targeted treatment for cancer, such as immunotherapy, blocks the abnormal growth of cancerous cells by attacking specific molecules which instruct them to grow and spread.But to evaluate its effectiveness, clinicians often have to rely on imaging techniques such as MRI and CT scans, which are costlyand can only be determined weeks after the treatment, said Asst Prof Shao Huilin from the National University of Singapore’s Department of Biomedical Engineering and the Institute for Health Innovation and Technology (iHealthtech).Alternatively, a tissue biopsy, which is an invasive procedure, is carried out, she said.Prof Shao and her team have now developed ExoScope, which is able to accurately detect cancer drug effectiveness within a day through the use of a platform to identify extracellular vesicles which circulate in the blood.Extracellular vesicles are secreted by cancer cells and carry a variety of “cargo” inherited from their parent cells, including proteins, DNA, RNA and even drugs.When the cancer treatment is successful, it means that the targeted cancer drug has attached to the cancer cell and interfered with its tumour growth, and so the treated cell will release extracellular vesicles, containing the drug, into the bloodstream.This will be detected by ExoScope sensors which are able to indicate drug effectiveness, said Zhang Yan, who is one of the authors of the study and a doctoral student from the NUS Department of Biomedical Engineering and iHealthtech.Prof Shao said the platform can also be used to diagnose cancer early by detecting extracellular vesicles in the bloodstream.This could possibly be integrated into a routine blood test for yearly health check-ups, she said. — The Straits Times/ANN"

Then my haj departure got cancelled and I was left disappointed, ” said Yeti, the owner of a car spare parts shop.“Now I just feel dispirited.”For the second consecutive year, hundreds of thousands of Indonesian would-be pilgrims will have to put their haj plans on hold after the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation decided to cancel the 2021 haj due to concerns over the pandemic.Henny Marina, a 48-year-old paediatrician in Bandung, West Java, and her husband are among the would-be pilgrims who have had their lifelong dreams interrupted.So is private company employee Ahmad Tahmid, 49, who has to wait another year with his wife after years of saving money for the haj while raising three children.“I’m sure every pilgrim feels let down by this cancellation, including myself, but at the end of the day, we have to be realistic in seeing the situation, ” Ahmad said.Freshnel Kreasindo Perkasa, a Yogyakarta-based haj travel agency that organises haj tours mainly in Central Java and East Java, said many people felt dejected by the government’s decision after years of long spiritual preparation.Its branch in Kebumen, for instance, was supposed to send 80 pilgrims from Central Java to Mecca this year.“We’ve tried helping them spiritually and psychologically to get through their disappointment, ” Freshnel manager Titik Wahyuni said, adding that the company did so while bearing the economic burden the pandemic had caused for the past two years, forcing it to let go two-thirds of its staff in Kebumen.The haj is regarded by Muslims as one of the five essential pillars of their faith and performing it at least once is an obligation for everyone whose health and wealth allows them to do so.For many Indonesian Muslims, the religious pilgrimage is a once-in-a lifetime event and the wait time can take up to 20 years because of a quota system.Indonesia usually has the largest quota of haj pilgrims in the world.Last year, the country planned to send up to 221,000 people for the annual haj before deferring the programme due to the pandemic and Saudi Arabia’s indefinite suspension of the haj for overseas pilgrims.The Religious Affairs Ministry recorded that nearly 180,000 of the Indonesian pilgrims had paid for their scheduled journeys. — The Jakarta Post/ANN"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Asean+,,Experts hope to raise bamboo shark numbers,"IN the Gulf of Thailand, fisheries researchers use a guideline to scuba dive to the ocean floor, where they release baskets full of young bamboo sharks.The small, slow-moving, bottom-dwelling sharks with striped bodies and an extra long tail have become endangered in recent years because of their popularity with fish collectors and exotic food diners.Researchers have released scores of juvenile bamboo sharks in the Gulf over the past several months, hoping to remove the species from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s “Near Threatened” red list.“We dive down to the sea base to release the fishes in a safe area so that they will have a better chance to survive. If we release them on the water surface, they will be eaten by bigger fish or swim out from shelter, ” fisheries official Udom Krueniam said.Researchers last week released 40 of the brown-banded bamboo sharks, aged between two and three months, in a purpose-built artificial coral reef at a depth of 18 metres.The species is native to the Gulf of Thailand and is also found across South-East Asia, Japan and Northern Australia.One of the smallest marine predators, the sharks grow to a maximum length of around 1.2m and are not dangerous to humans.They feed mainly at night, using their small teeth to grasp or crush prey.Experts hope the released sharks will settle in to their new home, where they will initially be sheltered by the man-made reef and hopefully reproduce.Researchers help hatch the eggs in an aquarium, rather than in the open sea where they are vulnerable to other predators.Udom said a successful egg hatching project last year provided more baby sharks to release this year. The project has so far helped deliver more than 200 bamboo sharks to the Gulf of Thailand. — Reuters"

A stop-work order following an incident in Alam Damai on March 22,2021 has been lifted.Notwithstanding this, MARC’s sensitised scenario which has incorporated a six-month delay in tolling commencement to June 2022 among other factors indicates a finance service cover ratio of above the covenanted 1.5 times for 2021-2024.This is primarily due to sizeable pre-funded cash and reserves of RM1.06bil.The principal repayment is materially constrained by the non-amortising structure of the senior facilities, worth up to RM4.7bil that need to be repaid in 2027, given that PLSUKE will not be able to generate sufficient cash flow during this period to meet the bullet repayment.In this regard, the rating agency believes that PLSUKE’s linkage to Prolintas and PNB, as well as the long remaining tenure of the concession (at least 42 years from 2027), would provide room to undertake a refinancing exercise."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Business,,UAE federal bank planning second-ever sale of dollar debt,"ABU DHABI: A lender wholly owned by the federal government of the United Arab Emirates mandated banks for its second international bond sale.Emirates Development Bank (EDB) hired Emirates NBD Capital, Standard Chartered Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to arrange investor calls from yesterday, according to a person familiar with the matter.The bank, which started operations in 2015 and provides financing to UAE citizens and small-and medium-sized enterprises, could raise US$750mil (RM3.1bil) or more, people familiar with matter said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.A five-year offering is expected if the market conditions are suitable.The proceeds would go toward supporting companies in sectors considered a priority for the economy, the people said.The bank’s debt is assigned the fourth-highest investment grade from Fitch Ratings, the same as the sovereign.A spokesperson for EDB declined to comment.The UAE passed a law in October 2018 allowing the federal government to issue sovereign debt for the first time, enabling its seven emirates to benefit from a higher credit rating and lower borrowing costs.EDB was the first entity to take advantage of the law by selling its first debt in 2019. The government has yet to issue a federal bond for the first time.The price of global oil benchmark Brent crude has almost doubled since October to more than US$70 (RM287) a barrel as major economies vaccinate their citizens and businesses reopen -- a boon for the UAE, Opec’s third-largest producer.Favourable financing conditions thanks to ultra-low borrowing costs are meanwhile prompting emerging-market sovereigns and state firms to address any funding needs for later this year.Bahrain, Saudi Aramco and Qatar Petroleum are among issuers from the Gulf region that are wading back into debt markets. Abu Dhabi sold US$2bil (RM8.2bil) of dollar bonds in late May, followed by the emirate’s sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co. — Bloomberg"

Someone else will be acting in it. The production will do a nationwide casting in Malaysia to find someone,” said Nicol.ACE Pictures will search for Nicol’s role via a nationwide casting in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak,Nicol’s coach, Liz Irving of Australia, will be played by a Hollywood actress but no name has been given as the production is keeping most of the details under wraps for now.The screenplay will be done by two high-profile female screenwriters - a Malaysian and a US-based writer.Asked what her favourite segment in the biopic would be, Nicol said: “My best part of this movie or the essence of it is the portrayal of a woman’s will and dedication that is so profound, it becomes life itself.”“And the complex struggles one has to face when confronted with the reality of having to let go of something so deeply a part of herself,” she said.Meanwhile, ACE Pictures president Peter Wong said the biopic would be produced in English.“Hearing Nicol speak about her life story gave us a completely different view into the sacrifices that had to be done in order to achieve her remarkable level of success,” said Peter in a press statement.“While we believe many are willing to go beyond the ordinary for their careers as a pro athlete, the love and dedication Nicol has for the sport exceed normal understanding. This is why her biopic will not only be about an underdog’s rise to success - she was and always has been an established icon.”On the production’s active steps in advocating gender equality by not only choosing a pro athlete but also two distinguished women screenplay writers, Peter said: “Both are masters of the craft, we believe that collaboration between the two writers will bring about a deeper dimension and more values into the screenplay.”The biopic will not only cater to local audiences but also key markets in the US and Europe as ACE Pictures has distribution networks and connections to sales agencies in these regions."

AVINESHWARAN,Tunku Ismail says he’s buying players to improve JDT,"PETALING JAYA: Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) owner Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has lambasted critics for claiming that he is spoiling the Malaysian football league by signing top players from other clubs.In an Instagram live session titled “Nindia Bola” hosted by football commentator Hafizal Hamad on Sunday, he answered several questions on the national team, Malaysian football and his club.However, he was piqued by a participant who asked why he is spoiling the league with multiple buying of the players.Tunku Ismail retorted by asking about the clubs who have not paid their players’ salaries for months.“If you have four to five teams not paying salaries, who is spoiling the league? Me or the clubs? If they do not take care of the welfare or salaries of the players, how can I be the person ruining the league?” he questioned.“I spend according to my means. My rivals have to spend according to their budget. In financial management, you mismanage, that’s your failure, not mine.“I rescue the players who are not getting salaries.“You can ask the PFAM president about players who haven’t received their wages and what I do for them. Every Raya, who gives Raya pocket money?“I am the owner of JDT. What’s my responsibility? The success of my club. Whatever the strategy, commercial, recruitment or academy, that’s our responsibility.“Look at Bayern (Munich), they buy players from their rivals because they want to make their team successful.“If I have to buy players to improve the team, I will buy that player. If I’ve to develop, I will develop.“My responsibility is towards JDT. If I have to buy more players, I will buy them.”Under his leadership, the Southern Tigers have won 17 trophies, of which seven of them were Super League titles. This season, they are top of the league table with 30 points.He had further enhanced his squad for the Super League when he signed Nathaniel Hong Wan from the Wolverhampton youth team in the second transfer window, and Indonesian midfielder Syahrian Abhimanyu who will return to the club after his loan stint with A-League side Newcastle Jets.He also added former Perak duo centreback Shahrul Saad and striker Guilherme De Paula in the recently concluded second transfer window.On another question that his style of managing the club borders on arrogance, Tunku Ismail said to run a professional club, you need to be the best and not be humble all the time.“If we run a professional club, you need the best transportation, clothing and players. You need to look presentable and professional. In competition, there is no humbleness.“In competition, you need an ego booster.”"

The AFL and our game did not do enough to stand with him at the time, and call it out.""The Hall of Fame's induction event was scheduled for June 22 but postponed due to an outbreak of COVID-19 in Melbourne.Goyder said the decision was not disclosed earlier because Goodes did not want to detract from the 2021 inductees.Goodes won two championships with the Swans and two Brownlow Medals as the league's ""fairest and best"" player in 2003 and 2006.He used his Australian of the Year title to push for Indigenous Australians' rights but his strong views upset conservatives, while right-wing pundits branded him divisive.The vitriol spilled over stadium fences in his final season, with crowds booing his every touch of the ball.It took the league almost four years before offering a formal apology to Goodes for failing to do enough to call out the ""racism"" of the booing crowds.Since retiring, Goodes has remained distant from the AFL.Goyder said the AFL's apology in 2019 was ""too late"" but apologised again on behalf of the league to Goodes.""Failure to call out racism and not standing up for Adam let down all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander players, past and present,"" he said.""We hope that there will be a time in the future when Adam will want to be connected to the game again. This is a decision for Adam and Adam only and we understand and respect his choice.""(Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Peter Rutherford)"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",,Sport,,Expectations rising for England after Southgate’s youth revolution,"LONDON: Energised by his vibrant young team, England manager Gareth Southgate heads into Euro 2020 harbouring genuine hopes of ending his country’s 55-year wait to win a major tournament.Southgate has overseen an impressive youth revolution since taking charge of England in 2016 and the delayed European Championship could be the perfect time for his labours to bear fruit.With an average age of 25 years and three months, England will go into the tournament with one of the youngest squads.But after reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup and making the last four in the Nations League a year later, Southgate believes England have a golden opportunity to win a senior international prize for the first time since the 1966 World Cup.That iconic success came on home turf and Southgate was an England player when they reached the Euro 96 semi-finals at Wembley.Southgate’s current crop will be helped by a tournament schedule that could see England play all but one of their games at Wembley if they reach the final.Asked recently if anything less than a semi-final appearance would be a failure, Southgate said: “Yeah, it probably will.“I think we’re realistic about that, we have to live with that expectation.“Are we ready to win? Well, we’ve been to two semi-finals so the next step is to try to go further.”Southgate’s confidence is inspired by the influx of dynamic youngsters who have added drive and skill to a squad already featuring seasoned campaigners Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling, Kyle Walker and Jordan Henderson.Phil Foden, Mason Mount, Jack Grealish and Jadon Sancho give Southgate an embarrassment of riches in the playmaking department.Arsenal’s versatile winger Bukayo Saka staked his claim for Euro involvement when he capped an eye-catching display with his first England goal in last week’s friendly against Austria.Borussia Dortmund’s promising 17-year-old midfielder Jude Bellingham made his first England start in that 1-0 victory.Underlining the quality available to Southgate in comparison to some of his predecessors, there were seven England players involved in the Champions League final, with Chelsea’s Mount providing the killer pass for Kai Havertz’s winner against Manchester City.Meanwhile, Ben White has been chosen to replace the injured Trent Alexander-Arnold.The 23-year-old Brighton defender made his England debut after coming off the bench in a 1-0 win over Austria last Wednesday.He started alongside Tyrone Mings in Sunday’s 1-0 win over Romania in England’s last warm-up before the tournament. — AFP"

I think after the first point things got a little bit better, a little bit easier,"" she said.""Then I broke her. I just felt like, yeah, I can play, I can actually play her.

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",12:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,DAVIN ARUL,'The Falcon And The Winter Soldier' review: Bearing the weight of a broken world on its shoulders,"Just the thrill of hearing Michael Giacchino's stirring fanfare for the Marvel Studios intro before the start of The Falcon And The Winter Soldier (TFATWS) would have been enough for this unabashed Marvel Zombie to slap a glowing review on this six-episode miniseries.Once, perhaps. Pre-Blip, maybe.And by ""Blip"", I mean the forced changes in lifestyle, mobility and perspective brought on by this awful pandemic which, if anything, have left many of us more cynical, more critical, and less trusting of people, institutions and authority... well, just about everything.TFATWS has all the hallmarks of a Marvel Cinematic Universe blockbuster and sometimes seems way too large to be confined to the dimensions of a tablet (on which I binged this, since I don't have a ""smart"" enough TV to run Disney+ Hotstar).It's a buddy show, has a whole lot of individual arcs, is loaded with action and humour, follows its numerous comic-book sources rather faithfully, and has plenty of visual and musical callbacks to pivotal moments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Not forgetting a multitude of Easter eggs, pop culture references (a Beverly Hills Cop II reference within the first half hour?), grandstanding speeches and ""aww, gee"" bonding moments.Familiar characters return (Emily VanCamp's Agent 13, for one, and Miss ""Move, or you will be moved"" from Civil War), new characters show up (including one who could only be played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus), new locations are introduced (like Madripoor, a wretched hive of scum and villainy known in the comics as a hangout for Wolverine!).There's a lot in there to please fans, courtesy of series creator Malcolm Spellman (Empire) and his writing team (which includes John Wick creator Derek Kolstad, who pens the show's most shocking episode).And with just one director (TV veteran Kari Skogland) helming the whole show, there is the polish to be expected of her experience, and a consistency in tone.Yet with so much in here, TFATWS also stumbles from uneven pacing, strangely placed interludes, and some pretty obvious arbitrary writing that calls its main character's judgment into question.Set a few months after the events of Avengers: Endgame, TFATWS begins with Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), a.k.a. the Falcon, returning the shield bestowed on him by Steve Rogers to the US government.Working as a free agent to handle cross-border ""issues"", Sam also has his hands full as a civilian trying to help his sister and her two young sons save the struggling family business.This raises some interesting questions about whether or not superheroes get paid, and the financial straits of the Wilson family do not really ring true.Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the Winter Soldier, is also on his own, attending mandatory therapy sessions as a condition of his pardon (from all the bad stuff he did under Hydra's control).He has a list of names of people who suffered as a result of his wetwork, and is trying to make amends – not too successfully – one name at a time.It's a very different world out there in the MCU, with millions displaced by the Blip (first from the Thanos snap and then the Bruce Banner one).An international entity known as the Global Repatriation Council has arisen to repatriate those millions, and as is often the case, resorts to ""impartial"" enactments and military force to do so.Those affected will not go quietly into resettlement camps, however, and a rebel anti-patriotic organisation known as the Flag Smashers (comic-book root: the Flag-Smasher, a Captain America foe) is carrying out acts of terror to get its message out to the world.The message: One World, One People, not the worst slogan after someone like Thanos came a-calling.Not too out of sync with the wobbly orbit of our own broken world either, but the parallels are not drawn clearly enough to matter.As mentioned earlier, there are a number of arcs here. Aside from Sam and Bucky's, we also have that of Karli Morgenthau (Erin Kellyman), the leader of the Flag Smashers, supposedly struggling with her conscience and having a semblance of... something remaining that makes Sam think she is worth saving.We'll get to that later.The other main arc involves John Walker (Wyatt Russell), the new Captain America who is chosen by the US government to take up the shield and role.Like Sam, he has no Super-Soldier serum and relies only on his natural ability and training to get by – and inevitably feels incredible pressure from both his role and the super-powered villains he has to fight.These four characters' paths intersect, they clash, and for the most part, you can figure what makes them tick and even be somewhat sympathetic towards their respective struggles.Daniel Bruhl returns as Zemo from Civil War, though his role here is not so much a character arc as it is the juicy chance to play twisted Jiminy Cricket to the major dramatis personae.Where TFATWS stumbles, though, is in the enormous burden it places on Sam Wilson's shoulders. In addition to his personal struggles, Sam also has to cope with the show's attempt to deal with race politics and his own journey towards becoming worthy of claiming the shield.""They will never let a Black man be Captain America,"" one embittered soul tells him at one point, while two white police officers seeing an out-of-costume Sam arguing with Bucky in the street immediately presume the black man is the aggressor.This is a lot, even in an ""extended feature"" like TFATWS, and as part of the creative team's perception of Sam's nobility, Karli's redemption sort of becomes his pet side project.Does every Cap have to save a soul from the brink? It was very different with Steve Rogers and Bucky, though, given their history. Karli is just... some random butcher, to be honest.She is frequently portrayed as a callous murderer (""His life doesn't matter to me,"" she coldly tells someone whose best friend she just killed), with Sam often witnessing her acts, and thus his determination to ""save"" her only makes the viewer question his judgment.Yes, he is stubborn in doing what he thinks is right, but the way the writers manipulate the whole Karli-GRC-Cap-Falcon conflict just makes him look stupidly obstinate.Still, the joys of TFATWS eventually outweigh its miscalculations and missteps.The buddy-adventure aspect is fun, thanks to the by-now-familiar chemistry of Mackie and Stan; Russell adds an intriguing, layered and aggressive dynamic to the mix; and some interesting groundwork is laid for wherever Marvel Studios intends to take these characters next.Just... take those blinkers off Sam, next time.All six episodes of The Falcon And The Winter Soldier are available on Disney+ Hotstar."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",12:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,The next bug thing: French 'bug farm' thrives on demand for pesticide-free fruit,"Farmers in western France are doubling down on an unusual crop: breeding millions of tiny predatory bugs and wasps to protect tomato plants without resorting to the insecticides that consumers are shunning.""Here, we're in one of the greenhouses for a bug that's called the macrolophus,"" says Pierre-Yves Jestin, as clouds of the pale green insects swarm around his hands.Jestin is president of Saveol, the Brittany cooperative that is France's largest tomato producer, cranking out 74,000 tonnes a year.For several years the cooperative has promoted ""pesticide-free"" harvests in response to growing concerns about the impact of harsh chemicals on humans and the environment.It does so thanks to its own bug farm, launched in 1983, that now stretches across 4,500sq m (just over one acre) outside Brest, where the tip of Brittany juts out into the Atlantic.Plans are in the works to add 1,200sq m more this year, producing macrolophus as well as tiny wasps that feed on common tomato pests such as whiteflies and aphids.Every week the insects are packed up in plastic boxes and shipped to the cooperative's 126 growers.""This new extension will allow us to increase our breeding of macrolophus, which are increasingly in demand for the pesticide-free range,"" said Roselyne Souriau, head of the insect programme at Saveol, whose name means 'sunrise' in the local Breton language.""At the same time, it will let us develop a new range – at least we hope – better suited to strawberries, with parasitic micro-wasps that feed on aphids,"" she said.A third wayBecause the vast majority of Brittany's tomatoes are grown in greenhouses, they do not qualify for an organic label, which requires plants to be grown under natural conditions in the ground.That prompted Saveol to team up with two other Brittany cooperatives, Sica and Solarenn, two years ago to promote their pesticide-free offerings.""In 2020, we didn't use any chemical treatments at all,"" said Francois Pouliquen, whose eight hectares at the Saveur d'Iroise farm are part of the Saveol network.""Consumers are now looking to eat healthily,"" he said. ""Organic produce exists of course, but it isn't always within reach for people on a budget. Pesticide-free is an alternative, a third way, for mass production that is still healthy,"" he said.Overall, use of predatory insects by French farmers has soared, with regulators approving 330 species as plant pest treatments in the first quarter of this year, up from 257 in 2015, according to the agriculture ministry.At Saveol's insect farm, the predatory bugs feast on moth eggs spread over hundreds of tobacco plants, which are in the same family as tomatoes and eggplants.The broad leaves make it easy when workers cut the tops off the plants and shake the insects into a giant metal funnel for packing.Some 10 million macrolophus and 130 million micro-wasps are produced each year, and Saveol claims it is the only growers' cooperative in Europe with its own insect-raising facility. – AFP Relaxnews"

But now the rock 'n' roll legend's former BMW has finally been restored and has gone on display in a Munich museum dedicated to famous German cars.The King's original BMW 507 roadster has joined the classic car exhibits in Bavaria's Motorworld museum and events space, located in an impressive former railway repair factory in Munich, the same city where BMW has its headquarters.Visitors can do their own renditions of Elvis songs next to his old convertible, however according to a spokeswoman, the karaoke plans are on hold for the time being due to pandemic restrictions.After many years in the US, the car's arrival in Munich has brought it closer to home, as it was not only made in Germany, but purchased there too.According to BMW, Presley bought the 150-horsepower car in Frankfurt shortly after he began his military service in 1958 and sold it again in the US about two years later.Elvis reportedly changed the colour of his roadster to red after female fans kept writing him messages on the car's white paint job.Elvis later sold on the car for US$3,500 (RM14,400), after which it changed hands several times and ended up in storage in California for decades.It was restored to its original design by BMW Group Classic between 2014 and 2016. - dpa"

But it quit pursuing advanced chipmaking technology in 2018 due to the high costs of development and IBM instead turned to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to make its chips.IBM ""went silent for nearly two-and-a-half years"" after the changes in 2018, but then in April of this year sent GlobalFoundries a letter alleging that the chipmaker had violated its contract,"" the filing said.""Other than threatening to sue unless it capitulated to its demands, IBM has yet to provide any substantive explanation as to its claims,"" GlobalFoundries wrote in the suit.IBM said in a statement it believes GlobalFoundries did not fulfill its obligations under the contract.""IBM contributed $1.5B to Global Foundries to supply the next generation of chips, and Global Foundries utterly abandoned IBM as soon as the final payment was received and sold off assets from the deal for its own enrichment,"" IBM said.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Tech,SARAH MCBRIDE,SoftBank fund invests US$50mil in Black and Latinx-led tech startups in a year,"SoftBank created the Opportunity Fund barely a week after the murder of George Floyd. The firm committed to invest US$100mil (RM412.80mil) in companies led by underrepresented racial minorities, establishing the largest fund of its kind. A year later, SoftBank has already allocated half the cash and anticipates creating a second fund by year-end.It’s far too early to tell whether the investments will be successful. The money is reaching about 50 young technology companies around the US and giving them a chance to prove the merits of their businesses before going on to seek more capital from SoftBank or elsewhere.All of the investments are in startups founded by Black or Latinx entrepreneurs. The average check is for US$1mil (RM4.13mil), and a half-dozen or so are already gearing up to raise their next round of funding.""Seed and A, that’s where you can make the most difference,” said Shu Nyatta, a managing partner at SoftBank Group International who leads the fund. ""The wrong way to do it is to have a pile of money.”Historically, minority entrepreneurs have rarely had access to seed capital, let alone piles of money. Of those who received venture capital from 1990 to 2016, 4.2% were Black or Hispanic, according to a Harvard Business School study.Floyd’s death served as a catalyst for venture capitalists, as it did for racial justice protests that swept the globe. In addition to SoftBank’s fund, a new firm called Concrete Rose Capital raised US$25mil (RM103.20mil) to invest in underrepresented founders and companies that cater to minorities.Base10, the largest Black-led VC firm, said a year ago it would donate 1% of profits to racial equality organisations and outlined a new plan to Bloomberg Businessweek last month to bolster the endowments of historically Black colleges and universities.SoftBank Investment Advisers, the division that runs the US$100bil (RM412.80bil) Vision Fund, introduced an initiative last year to mentor entrepreneurs from underrepresented groups.Its programme, Emerge, is an accelerator that typically targets companies at an earlier stage than the Opportunity Fund with investments of at least US$150,000 (RM619,200). Fourteen US-based companies were accepted into the programme last year, and SoftBank expects to expand the programme to Europe this year.For the second Opportunity Fund, SoftBank may tap its own coffers once again, or the Japanese firm could seek a partner. Nyatta, the managing partner, envisions broadening the fund’s reach, perhaps to events that extend beyond companies in its portfolio.""Imagine a Sun Valley conference, just with underrepresented founders,” he said, referring to the annual summit of technology and media A-listers in Idaho. ""We want to do something really special in this space, or we won’t do anything at all.”One company that raised cash from the Opportunity Fund is Vitable LLC, a Woodlyn, Pennsylvania-based startup providing home and virtual visits by medical providers. The company raised US$1.6mil (RM6.6mil) last year and got a bunch of valuable introductions from its new partners at SoftBank, said Vitable founder Joseph Kitonga.Those included executives from the insurance company Lemonade Inc. and the delivery startup GoPuff, which are larger companies also backed by SoftBank. And last Thursday, Kitonga spent a chunk of time on the phone getting advice on marketplace-building with one of the fund’s founding partners, Stacy Brown-Philpot, the former chief executive officer of TaskRabbit.Increasingly, VC firms are competing to invest in long-neglected minority-led tech businesses. Last month, Atlanta-based Collab Capital said it raised an inaugural fund of US$50mil (RM206.4mil) to back startups led by Black founders.The firm takes a broader definition of success than a typical VC. It will seek not just high-growth companies but also smaller ones that can generate consistent profits, said Barry Givens, a managing partner at the firm.Givens shrugged off the threat of competition with other VCs for investments in Black-led tech startups: ""If there’s any competition in the world I want to be having, it’s that competition.” – Bloomberg"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Tech,RICHARD CLOUGH,Jeff Bezos plans to travel to space on Blue Origin flight,"Jeff Bezos will go to space next month when his company, Blue Origin, launches its first passenger-carrying mission.The 57-year-old, who plans to travel alongside his brother, Mark, made the announcement in an Instagram post Monday. The scheduled launch next month will be about two weeks after the billionaire plans to step down as chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc.""Ever since I was five years old, I’ve dreamed of traveling to space,” Bezos said in the post. ""On July 20th, I will take that journey with my brother. The greatest adventure, with my best friend.”Blue Origin is one of several high-profile space-tourism companies backed by a wealthy entrepreneur, alongside Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Richard Branson-backed Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. Both of those companies are making plans to carry paying customers.Blue Origin is auctioning off a seat on its New Shepard rocket for the July 20 flight, an 11-minute trip to suborbital space that will reach an altitude of about 100 kilometers (62 miles).The spot will be the only one available for purchase on the flight, and the proceeds will go to a Blue Origin foundation that promotes math and science education.The high bid stood at US$2.8mil (RM11.54mil) Monday morning, according to the company’s website. Bidding will end June 12 with a live online auction. It will be Blue Origin’s 16th flight.The company has said that customers will have a four-day experience, including three days of preflight training at the company’s launch site near Van Horn, Texas. Blue Origin has built accommodations, including a cafeteria.The space capsule will be a first-class experience, with reclining leather seats designed to cushion the force of zipping into space. The capsule also has ""the largest windows in spacecraft history,"" according to Blue Origin’s website, so passengers can take in the view.Branson, 70 years old, plans to fly on a Virgin Galactic flight to suborbital space, perhaps as early as this summer. The timing of that launch had been in doubt after several test failures and got back on track last month with a successful flight to space carrying two pilots.John Glenn was the oldest person to fly in space, at 77, when he hitched a ride aboard a space shuttle as a US senator in 1998. Glenn had been the first American to orbit the earth, as a National Aeronautics and Space Administration astronaut in 1962.Bezos has been slowly selling off his stake in Amazon to invest in Blue Origin. In 2017 he said he spends about US$1bil (RM4.12bil) a year on the sideline. He has compared space tourism to stunt-flying barnstormers, who helped fuel public fascination with aviation and made it a common mode of transportation.Bezos has said he envisions millions of people living and working in space, and lowering the cost of space travel with rockets that can be reused like airplanes is the first step.The billionaire plans to hand the reins as Amazon’s CEO to Andy Jassy on July 5.

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",10:36 AM MYT,Tech,ROGER TUNG,Taiwan mayor says too early to say if tech hub safe from COVID spike,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -It is still too early to say whether the major chip companies that operate in Taiwan's tech hub of Hsinchu will be safe from the latest increase in COVID-19 infections, its mayor said, though chip giant TSMC said it had seen no impact so far.After months of relative safety, Taiwan is dealing with a rise in domestic infections, which have since last week begun impacting a small number of tech firms in Miaoli, the town adjacent to Hsinchu, including chip test and packaging firm King Yuan Electronics and semiconductor equipment provider Foxsemicon Integrated Technology.Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors and is central to global efforts to resolve a chip shortage that has shuttered some car plants around the world and is now starting to affect consumer electronics.Hsinchu, home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip maker, has set up an ""anti-epidemic combat alliance"" with Miaoli to ensure infections do not spread.President Tsai Ing-wen has vowed to build a ""line of defence"" to protect what she called an ""industry of national importance,"" sending soldiers last week to help build test stations in Hsinchu Science Park.Hsinchu Mayor Lin Chih-chien, in an interview with Reuters late on Monday, said that he could not guarantee total safety for the city's tech firms, but that the government had rolled out rapid testing stations.""I don't dare to say there is absolutely no problem. If there were no problem, then we wouldn't need to set up rapid testing stations in the science park so urgently and quickly,"" said Lin, a member of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.On Sunday he said they had tested more than 1,800 migrant workers and found five positive cases.He said it was ""too early to say"" whether the city's tech firms were totally safe.Hsinchu's science park is home to more than 10,000 migrant workers, with almost 68,000 in the city, its neighbouring county and Miaoli, with some dormitories housing more than 10 people per room, creating a possible ""hotbed"" for transmission, Lin said.TSMC SEES NO IMPACTSo far the pandemic has not had a major impact on TSMC, which last month began stepped up disease-prevention measures, including separating work teams and telling staff and vendors not to move across its main production sites in Hsinchu, Taichung and Tainan.TSMC said in a statement the company had not started mass testing of employees.""Regarding the rise in infections in Miaoli, we have not seen any impact so far, and we are monitoring the situation closely,"" the company said.By Tuesday morning, more than 250 cases had been reported in four tech companies in the area, the majority of which were in migrant workers from Southeast Asian countries.Companies affected included chip packaging and testing firm Greatek Electronics Inc and telecom equipment maker Accton Technology Corp.In a statement to the stock exchange on Monday, King Yuan, which has recorded more than 200 infections, said it expected a 30%-35% impact on production in June.(Reporting by Roger Tung; Writing by Ben Blanchard and Yimou Lee.

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Opinion,PROF DR MOHD TAJUDDIN MOHD RASDI,How Malaysia’s Parliament created a politician like Tajuddin,"RECENTLY, a politician was removed from his position heading a government-linked corporation amidst protests over what was seen as his cavalier treatment of a rail accident that saw many injured, some seriously. Malaysians came down hard on his manners and conduct that seemed, to many, to be rude, unprofessional and demeaning to journalists as well as to the gravity of the accident.I am not defending that politician but I would like to point out that his unprofessional and un-Malaysian conduct is no more than a reflection of a political culture developed over more than four decades under one ruling power and the support of a great many people of one race as well as the apathy of others.Let us look at one example of Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman’s “style of politics” in Parliament. He once made a crude “joke” about an Opposition woman MP’s name which was greeted with much hilarity by his party’s MPs, both male and female.My first criticism is about how our Speakers in Parliament deal with issues of foul language, sexist statements and racial slurs. The Speakers keep saying things like “Yang Berhormat, tolong tarik balik, Yang Berhormat (sir, please retract, sir)”.If I were the Speaker, I would not say “tarik balik”, I would simply say “Yang Berhormat, tolong balik, Yang Berhormat (sir, please leave, sir)” – I would have suspended him for three months without any allowances if it were within my power to do so.As a Speaker, I would not tolerate one iota of racial slurs, sexist remarks or foul language. Members of Parliament who make these remarks would never get a second chance from me. Our Speakers and Parliament’s disciplinary practice must be firm or else the august House is just an overdeveloped kedai kopi (coffee shop).Secondly, what happened to the women MPs of his party? They should have come to the defense of their own gender instead of snickering derisively behind Tajuddin.It was a rude, sexist and foul remark of the lowest form – on the level of a boy threatening to rape his classmate, as in the recent “rape joke” incident.Despite the fact that the woman MP was from another party and of another race, other women MPs, regardless of party affiliation or race, should have stood up to Tajuddin and reminded him that it was akin to insulting his wife, daughter and mother. No wonder the likes of Tajuddin can still speak like this in Malaysia’s Parliament.Thirdly, I want to ask non-Malay MPs why they kept quiet when Tajuddin clearly made a racist joke using the woman MP’s Chinese name. By virtue of their silence, non-Malay groups too allow such behaviour in Parliament. Integrity, dignity and adab (manners) must go beyond race, religion and party politics if we are to rebuild this country and ensure just treatment of all.Fourthly, I wish to discuss Tajuddin’s political party. In the last 40 years, Umno, to me, seems to have condoned politicians who are quick to use racial slurs. It seems to me that to be elected to higher office in the party, a candidate simply needs to attack other races or make jokes about the “other”.Some have resorted to waving a keris about, even.There was a politician who called people who were demonstrating “beruk” (apes) and dubbed the Speaker a “Taliban” – and this politician has worn the mantle of minister for many years.There are those who use the word “pendatang” (immigrant) to refer to non-Malays and are quick to say that Malaysia belongs to one race – and these people keep rising to ever higher positions. It seems that such behaviour goes down well within the party and among its grassroots.Finally, I wish to address the people who see the likes of Tajuddin as a hulubalang, or champion, of the race. Imam Al Ghazali’s magnum opus published in the 12th century, Al-Ihya Ulumuddin, has a chapter dedicated to “The Destruction of Speech” in which he described the ethics of communication, conversations and speech that would destroy a Muslim’s piety and good position in the Hereafter. Those who support the behaviour and adab of people like Tajuddin will surely be questioned over their choice of a representative and leader in this life. Such leaders will not only be judged with strict justice but all of their supporters will also be judged. If the supporters make no effort to advise these leaders to treat others with respect and dignity, then judgment will be pronounced on all of them.Just as in this world where each citizen is responsible for his or her own vote, each soul must answer for his or her actions. People should read Al-Ihya Ulumuddin before they cast their votes to send out their representatives into the world because they will be held responsible for that choice.Tajuddin is not at fault alone, for it is ultimately us, Malaysians, who have to think about how to create a Parliament with members who treat citizens of all races, faiths and stations with respect, dignity and compassion.Prof Dr Mohd Tajuddin Mohd Rasdi is Professor of Architecture at UCSI University.

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",6:45 PM MYT,News,TOM ALLARD,How an informant and a messaging app led to huge global crime sting,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - It took $100,000 plus expenses, and the opportunity for a reduced prison sentence, for the smartphone developer to collaborate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2018 and kick-start Operation Trojan Shield, according to a court document.Three years later, the investigation involving 9,000 law enforcement officers from 17 countries saw authorities monitor 27 million messages from 12,000 devices in 100 countries and track the activities of more than 300 organised crime groups, the European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol, said in a statement.To date, there have been more than 800 arrests and the seizure of more than eight tonnes of cocaine, 22 tonnes of cannabis, two tonnes of synthetic drugs, 250 guns, 55 luxury vehicles and over $48 million in cash and cryptocurrencies, Europol said.More arrests and seizures are expected, it said.The U.S. court document - an affidavit from an FBI special agent first published by Vice News - says the ""confidential human source"", a former drug trafficker, had been creating a new hardened encrypted phone with a bespoke app called ANOM.The source came on board after authorities dismantled the Phantom Secure encrypted smartphone network and arrested its CEO in 2018.For at least a decade, organised crime groups have used phones like Phantom Secure to organise drug deals, hits on rivals and launder illicit earnings without detection, police say. Among many of the phones' features, content can be remotely wiped if they are seized.But as one model was put out of business, new ones would enter the lucrative market.The FBI decided it would launch its own, inserting a master key into the devices that attached to each message and enabled law enforcement officers to decrypt and store them as they were transmitted.'COUPLE OF BEERS'In 2018, Australian police investigators and analysts met with the FBI. ""As you know, some of the best ideas come over a couple of beers,"" said Australian Federal Police (AFP) commissioner Reece Kershaw on Tuesday.Prodded by authorities, the developer-turned-informant tapped his trusted distributors, who targeted the Australian market. They settled on a soft launch in October 2018. The developer gave the distributors only 50 devices to sell. Seeing a ""huge payday"", they agreed, according to the affidavit.As the AFP monitored the messages and photos shared on the devices, ""100% of ANOM users in the test phase used ANOM to engage in criminal activity"", the affidavit said. Business grew organically, by word-of-mouth. Soon overseas criminals were flocking to use the ANOM phone.Law enforcers had ""an edge"" that they had never had before, said Kershaw. Among hundreds of arrests and tons of drugs seized, Australian authorities said they also disrupted 21 murder plots, including a mass killing, thanks to ANOM.But, due to ""technological issues"", the FBI could not directly monitor the phones in Australia. A court order in late 2019, however, issued by an unspecified country where a server for the phones was located, gave the agency far greater and more timely access to their content.The FBI and other countries' law enforcers discovered that Italian organised crime, Asian triads, biker gangs and transnational drug syndicates were all users.The special agent's affidavit, and the AFP's Kershaw, said criminals used the phones openly, often not even using code words and frequently sharing photos of massive drug consignments and details of how they would be transported.Among the images shared in the affidavit were mounds of blocks of illicit drugs and a diplomatic pouch identified in the court document as French and allegedly used to transport cocaine from Colombia. There was also evidence of corrupt government officials and police.Crime groups were being ""notified of anticipated enforcement actions"", the affidavit said.""The review of ANOM messages has initiated numerous high-level public corruption cases in several countries.""Raids targeting users of another encrypted phone, Sky ECC, in March saw ANOM's popularity surge, with active users growing from 3,000 to 9,000 in months, the affidavit said.But the expiry of the unspecified country's court order on Monday signalled the end of the phones' torrent of criminal intelligence.

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",7:27 PM MYT,News,PARISA HAFEZI，JOHN IRISH,"Analysis: Iran nuclear deal rescue needs more time, envoys say ahead of fresh talks","DUBAI (Reuters) - A host of barriers to the revival of Iran's nuclear deal remain firmly in place ahead of talks due to resume this week between Tehran and world powers, suggesting a return to compliance with the 2015 accord is still a way off, four diplomats, two Iranian officials and two analysts say.Iranian demands about sanctions relief and Western concern over Iran's expanding nuclear know-how are among questions that may need weeks or possibly months of further negotiations, the diplomats and analysts said.The talks seek to revive a landmark pact under which Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions, which opened the way for a brief thaw in decades of U.S.-Iranian confrontation.Then-President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 saying it was too soft on Tehran, and reimposed sanctions. Iran responded by violating the agreement's limits.Trump's successor Joe Biden has said he wants to restore the deal's nuclear limits and if possible extend them to cover issues such as Iran's regional behaviour and missile programme. Iran wants all sanctions lifted and no expansion of the terms.European Union envoy Enrique Mora, the chief coordinator of the talks, said last week he believed a deal would be reached at the upcoming sixth round of negotiations in Vienna, expected to resume on Thursday or Friday.Adding to the impetus to make progress is an election in Iran on June 18 to replace President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who promoted the original deal. He is widely expected to be followed by a hardline successor.The election is not likely to change Tehran's negotiating stance: regardless of who is president any deal must be approved by Iran's hardline faction through Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. But neither Washington nor Tehran wants to start from scratch, or entangle the deal further in Iranian domestic politics.Iran's top nuclear negotiator said last week that barriers to a revival of the deal are complicated but not insurmountable. ""Differences have reached a point where everyone believes these differences are not insolvable,"" Abbas Araqchi said.However, none of the remaining sticking points lend themselves to rapid solutions, according to the diplomats, Iranian officials and analysts of Iranian nuclear matters.Their assessment chimes with downbeat remarks on Monday by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said Washington still did not know whether Iran was ready to resume compliance with the deal.""I doubt that the next round will be the final one... The parties are still far apart on core issues,"" said Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group.And when, or if, disagreements are solved, more talks would be needed on so-called sequencing - the delicate question of which side takes which action and when, in return for reciprocal steps by the other side, the diplomats said.The negotiations have made considerable progress but are now at the hardest part with the key decisions still needed, said a European diplomat briefed on the talks, which began in April.'THE HEART OF THE MATTER'The talks have arrived at ""the heart of the matter on the nuclear dimension"", a second European diplomat said.A senior Western diplomat said that “of course” he hoped that the next round would result in a deal, but injected a note of caution, saying “until we are able to resolve the important issues that remain, we won’t know.”An Iranian official said: ""Everything depends on Washington. If the American side accepts to lift all sanctions, then Iran will return into full compliance with the deal.""In addition to seeking the lifting of Trump-era sanctions, Tehran also wants Washington to remove Iran's Revolutionary Guards from a terrorism blacklist, which can be used to bar Iranian businesses from the international financial system. It wants Europe to guarantee foreign investors will return, and assurances that Washington will not renege on the deal again.But from the standpoint of Washington and its European allies, it would no longer be sufficient to return to the nuclear restrictions in the orginal deal, designed at the time to ensure that Iran could not build a bomb in less than a year.In the months that Iran has been breaching the limits, it has made technical advances that make the original restrictions out of date. Vaez noted that Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges, known as the IR9, which are 50 times more powerful at producing enriched uranium than the ones covered by the deal, known by its initials as the JCPoA.BREAKOUT TIME""If Iran refuses to destroy these machines, its breakout time will be shorter, unless it agrees to dismantle an equivalent number of IR1 machines. That is seen by Iran as humiliating and beyond the JCPoA's scope,"" Vaez said.The Iranians have acquired knowledge and capabilities they did not have before, said the European diplomat briefed on the talks, citing Iran's first ever production of uranium metal, a material that can be used to make the core of an atom bomb.The development, reported this year by the International Atomic Energy Agency, was not something covered by the 2015 deal, and any revival of the pact would have to take account of this new-found capability, Vaez said.Bob Einhorn, a former senior State Department official and nuclear negotiator with Iran, thought it highly unlikely that there would be an agreement before the presidential election, but conceivable one could be struck during the interim ""lame duck"" period before the new president takes office.Einhorn, now at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said there could be some political advantage for the new Iranian president to a deal being agreed during the interim.A new president could criticize any concessions made by the current Iranian administration of President Hassan Rouhani, then later take credit for any economic boost the deal produced, he said. ""So you could see a kind of logic.""(Reporting by Parisa Hafezi in Dubai; Additional reporting by John Irish in Paris, Arshad Mohammed in Washington and Francois Murphy in Vienna; Writing by William Maclean; Editing by Peter Graff)"

Her transgression: wearing her hijab in a campaign poster.The 26-year-old and the three other candidates who had been on the same ticket are now running as independents in the southern city of Montpellier under the slogan ""Different but united for you"".The affair erupted after the far-right seized upon the image as proof Macron was weak on protecting France's secular values, and propelled Zemmahi into a national row over identity.""We're not giving up,"" Zemmahi said, still wearing her hijab as she distributed campaign fliers in La Mosson, a low-income Montpellier district that is home to generations of Muslim immigrants from France's former north African colonies.In her first interview since she became embroiled in the national debate over the role of Islam in France, Zemmahi said she wanted to focus on promoting equal opportunities and fighting discrimination.""This is my neighbourhood, I was born here. The headscarf wasn't an issue for the four of us.""However, across much of France it is.Zemmahi's campaign photo split Macron's LaRem party, reflecting deep divisions over how secular laws should be applied, notably after Islam emerged as the country's second-biggest religion behind Catholicism.For supporters of a strict interpretation of laïcité, France's version of secularism, Islamic headwear has become a symbol of the politicisation of Islam, subjugation and resistance to the Republic's vision of French identity.Laïcité and identity will be central to the campaign battle ahead of the 2022 presidential vote.

With these data, we may be able to gain the public’s trust on the various brands of vaccines, ” she said.Previously, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme Khairy Jamaluddin urged those who have vaccination appointments not to reject a particular vaccine in favour of another, after several senior citizens who turned up for their vaccination appointments at the KL Convention Centre vaccination centre had rejected one brand of vaccine and wanted another brand instead.Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Azmi Mohd Tamil pointed out that certain parts of the Malaysian population are rejecting not only one brand of vaccine, but all forms of Covid-19 vaccinations.“This movement has gained traction due to ignorance and misinformation in the social media and communities. Therefore, the ability of this country to achieve herd immunity in a short period is not in sight.""It is unfortunate that such ignorance and wrongful fears are concentrated only in certain parts of the population.""Efforts must be made to identify the cause of vaccine hesitancy and community leaders must be roped in to help their communities register and be vaccinated, ” he said.Dr Azmi believed that the desire to register for the vaccine is very low, especially in the Malay-belt states.“The vaccine hesitancy in such states among those already registered are very high. Kelantan and Kedah have more than 10, 000 defaulters each, ” he said.He added that those who are eager to be vaccinated must be facilitated to get inoculated, otherwise the frustration among these groups will also grow.International Islamic University of Malaysia public health specialist Asst Prof Dr Mohammad Farhan Rusli said receiving any brand or type of vaccine will reduce an individual's risk of developing severe Covid-19 and will help free ICUs, hospitals and wards.He assured the public that they do not have to be afraid of the vaccines, as all the vaccines have received the World Health Organisation (WHO) Emergency Use Approval.“The vaccines have also been extensively checked by the NPRA on its safety use, ” he said, adding that the best vaccine is the one that is available to them."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",7:23 PM MYT,Asean+,,Japan ruling MPs seek emergency clause for constitution amid pandemic response discontent,"TOKYO (Reuters): Ruling party lawmakers in Japan, where lockdowns mostly entail voluntary compliance, hope the Covid-19 pandemic will build momentum to amend the post-war constitution and give the cabinet broad powers in crises.Although such a step might not come for years, the debate has garnered new attention amid the pandemic. Popular dissatisfaction with the government response to the coronavirus has created support for an emergency clause, with a Kyodo news agency survey last month showing 57% in favour.The shift in sentiment comes as parliament prepares to revise a law on holding national referendums on changing the constitution. The aim of the revisions is to make it easier to vote, such as by improving access to polling places.But the revisions, expected to pass this month, coincide with fresh calls by lawmakers in Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's Liberal Democratic Party for a constitutional amendment allowing the cabinet to limit civil rights in a national emergency.A referendum - needed for such an amendment - can only be held after two-thirds of both houses of parliament approve, a high hurdle given divided public opinion.Conservatives, many of whom see the US-drafted constitution as a symbol of humiliating defeat in World War Two, have long wanted to amend the charter's pacifist Article 9. But the pandemic has shifted attention to an emergency clause. The constitution has not been amended since it took effect in 1947.Proponents say an emergency clause is needed to cope with crises such as pandemics, enemy attacks and disasters.LDP Deputy Secretary General Masahiko Shibayama said the constitution allows passing laws that would restrict individual rights to protect the public welfare but in a sudden crisis, that could take too much time.In such a situation, he told Reuters, ""If the government cannot issue orders with the force of law, they could not protect people's lives.""Critics say the LDP proposal would cede too much to the cabinet.An emergency clause ""would give the cabinet the power to create a secret government during an emergency that the cabinet itself would declare,"" said former Meiji University law professor Lawrence Repeta. ""It would be the very antithesis of the constitutional democracy we have today.""Tokyo Metropolitan University professor Sota Kimura and other scholars and health experts dismissed suggestions that a constitutional flaw had hindered Japan's approach to the pandemic.""I don't think a lack of an emergency clause is the reason the COVID-19 response has not gone well. The problem is incompetent politicians,"" said Keio University professor Satoshi Yokodaido.Suga has been wary of tough steps because of their impact on the economy.How soon any amendment might be put to voters is unclear.The LDP and allies must first keep their two-thirds lower house majority in an election this year. And the revised law requires lawmakers to within three years decide on limits to advertising before a plebiscite.Seeking parliamentary approval of an amendment before the advertising issue is resolved would be ""politically difficult"", veteran LDP lawmaker Hajime Funada told Reuters."

Countries with a high vaccination rate have started to ease travel restrictions, ” Dr Sisavath said.“The government has instructed the Ministry of Health to speed up the vaccination drive to prevent the virus from spreading.”As of June 3, more than 647, 300 people had received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 283, 474 people had been given a second dose.The AstraZeneca, Sputnik V and Sinopharm vaccines are currently being administered.Laos is struggling to contain the Covid-19 community outbreak which erupted in mid-April.Because of the continuing infections in Vientiane, the government on June 4 extended the lockdown for another 15 days until June 19.Under a new notice issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, restrictions have been intensified in areas of infection known as red zones.At the same time, the government has eased some virus control measures to minimise the impacts on the economy and people’s livelihoods. - Vientiane Times/Asia News Network"

Her family has no knowledge of her whereabouts, nor formal explanation for her sudden detention.Ma Aient was a producer and co-writer on 'Money Has Four Legs', which appeared in the New Currents competition at the Busan International Film festival in 2020.She was also a regular participant at co-production and project promotion events intended to boost independent film making in Asia. These included the SEAFIC Open Fair, Ties That Bind, FAMU Summer Filmmaking Initiation Campus and the Locarno Festival's Open Doors consultancy.She was picked up by authorities in Yangon shortly after leaving home around midday on June 5, 2021. The next day, family members in Myanmar were informed of her arrest.They were told that she is being housed at an undisclosed place of interrogation. There has not been any communication with her since her disappearance.Ma Aeint's disappearance has alarmed film institutions in Asia.On Tuesday (June 8), the Busan festival issued a statement urging respect for her safety and civil rights. It was co-signed by eleven other festivals in South Korea. Thailand-based SEAFIC did the same.Media and civil society have come under direct attack since Myanmar's already-powerful military forces mounted a coup on Feb. 1, 2021.The coup followed several years of nominal power-sharing between the military and a civilian government headed by Aung San Suu Kyi.Military-backed parties were defeated in a general election in November 2020, but the military claims that the poll was rigged.Since taking back full control of national institutions, military forces have shot and killed several hundred anti-coup protesters, taken control of the media, shut down much of the internet and arrested journalists. This makes it difficult to learn information quickly and to verify it.Variety spoke to Ma Aient's producer-director colleague Maung Sun who remains in Myanmar, and to her sister who lives in the US.""On Sunday, June 6th afternoon, a few officials (not military) from the county office informed my aunt who resides at my late grandmother's house that Ma Aeint has been detained by the military and is being held at one of the military interrogation stations.""They didn't provide who exactly came and told them. They just said, 'Military' and one of the secret interrogation stations. It was not the police who took her,"" said sister Su Wai.""We are talking to a political lawyer as it could be a case of mistaken identity, of political agenda. It happens a lot lately and only the military handles such matters,"" said Su Wai.""We don't know which (interrogation) office she is at. There are around five offices around Yangon and they are infamous for torture and ill treatment,"" said Maung Sun.""Many people have perished while in interrogation, in just a few days.""Maung Sun said that, following the arrest of Ma Aeint, their company office had also been raided. He acknowledged that speaking out might cause problems for himself.""But then again, they already have some of my information, since they raided my office,"" he said.""The most important thing is that Ma Aeint is well treated in interrogation.""""My sister is a kind-hearted person who would give the shirt off her back to anyone. She is a smart businesswoman, a successful movie producer and a philanthropic person who used to work with the UN in Myanmar. She doesn't deserve any of this,"" said Su Wai.""We, as a family, are open to cooperation with anyone. We have nothing to hide, and (Ma Aeint) should be treated with respect and no harm should be done to her during her arrest and detaining period.""""The citizens and filmmakers of Myanmar including the producer, Ma Aeint are facing a horrendous reality in fear of their lives. The (Korean film) festivals strongly condemn the ongoing violence in Myanmar and urge release of the producer, Ma Aeint. Furthermore, we ask all the related authorities to protect her safety and civil rights fairly,"" said Busan and the other Korean festivals in an emailed statement.""We at SEAFIC are extremely concerned for (Ma Aeint's) well-being, and would like to demand for her immediate release. Her safety and well-being are of utmost importance. Moreover, we urge the Myanmar military to cease the crackdown on its filmmakers and free those who have been arrested immediately,"" said SEAFIC."

More than 400 emergency response personnel have also been deployed.Chen Fei, director of the State Forestry and Grassland Administration's Asian Elephant Research Centre, said they were watching closely to see if the herd resumes its northward trajectory, and would evacuate villages if necessary, CCTV said.The herd began its journey northwards more than a year ago, travelling from a designated elephant protection zone in Xishuangbanna, near China's border with Myanmar.The space available for China's last remaining native elephant community has gradually shrunk over the years, with the tropical forests of Xishuangbanna replaced with banana, tea or rubber plantations or used to plant lucrative raw materials for traditional Chinese medicine.It is unclear what prompted the herd to head north, but conservation efforts in Yunnan over the past decade have seen elephant numbers double, putting land and resources under increasing strain."

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the U.S. had pushed for the visit.When asked if the election results would change the United States' strategy in Mexico, Ricardo Zuniga, the Biden administration's special envoy to the Northern Triangle countries said the relationship doesn't depend on who is in power or domestic politics. ""It really doesn't impact our plans.""Zuniga also said Harris and Lopez Obrador will witness the signing of an memorandum of understanding between the two countries that will entail cooperation between development agencies that work in Central America and examine how they plan to allocate aid.The accord is aimed at boosting Harris's efforts of lowering the number of migrants from Central America's Northern Triangle countries - Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras - to the United States.Harris's chief spokeswoman and senior adviser Symone Sanders said late on Monday the Vice President's meeting with Lopez Obrador will follow up on their virtual meeting in May, when the two sought to expand cooperation between the United States and Mexico to address the root causes of migration from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.Sanders said Harris on Tuesday will look to build on topics discussed during the May meeting such as the two countries jointly agreeing to secure their borders and bolster human rights protections and spurring economic development in the Northern Triangle countries and in southern Mexico.They will also discuss migration specifically to the U.S.-Mexico border by stepping up enforcement, Sanders said.The Biden administration has been overwhelmed by the number of migrant children and families arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border, mostly from Central America and has looked to Mexico for help in slowing transit across its territory.On Monday, Harris met with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei and said the two leaders had ""robust"" talks on fighting corruption to deter migration from Central America.

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",8:08 PM MYT,Asean+,,Too early to say how landmark G-7 corporate tax deal will impact Singapore: minister,"SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): It is too early to say how the global corporate tax rule changes proposed by the Group of Seven (G-7) will impact Singapore, but the Republic's overall competitiveness has never been based on taxation alone, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Tuesday (June 8).In a Facebook post, Wong also said that Singapore will change its corporate tax system after a global consensus is reached on the new international rules. Any tax changes would be in close consultation with businesses and tax professionals here, he added.Before that, Singapore will be participating in the broader debate on the proposed tax changes in international forums, said Wong.G-7 finance ministers reached a landmark accord last Saturday backing the creation of a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15 per cent, an agreement that may go on to form the basis of a worldwide deal.Major economies are aiming to discourage multinationals from shifting profits - and tax revenues - to low-tax countries regardless of where their sales are made.Details are still being worked out, and the issue will be discussed among G-7 leaders meeting this weekend as well as by Group of 20 (G-20) finance ministers next month.""Singapore is not a G-20 member, but we have been invited to attend, and I look forward to sharing our views then, and contributing to the broader debate,"" said Wong.He said that while it is clear that international rules for corporate taxation will change, and all jurisdictions will need to adjust their tax systems and rules accordingly, it is too early now to say how it would impact Singapore.However, three things will not change for Singapore, the minister said.""First, we will continue to support a multilateral consensus-based solution that is anchored on sound economic principles, promotes tax certainty, and ensures a level playing field across all jurisdictions.""Second, as and when a global consensus is reached on the above framework, the Ministry of Finance and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore will make any necessary changes to Singapore's corporate tax system, in close consultation with businesses and tax professionals, said Wong.""Third, our overall competitiveness has never been based on taxation alone. It's about ensuring a conducive environment for businesses and entrepreneurs to thrive.""The finance chief stressed that the new rules should not inadvertently weaken the incentives for businesses to invest and innovate. Otherwise, countries will all be worse off, fighting over their share of a shrinking revenue pie, he said.He also noted that trust, reliability and integrity are ultimately what makes Singapore an attractive place for substantial economic activities.As for the revenue impact on Singapore of any global tax rule changes, it will depend on the parameters being set, the rules to be made, and crucially, how different governments and businesses respond to them, Wong said.The minister said the G-7 proposals will be further discussed at other international platforms. One of them is the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-led Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting in which Singapore is already involved.Financial experts believe that beyond an attractive tax regime, Singapore's strength derives from its stable political environment, trustworthy legal framework and connectivity to regional and global economies.Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, partner and head of tax at accounting firm KPMG, said; ""Singapore's strategic geographic location, regional and global connectivity and a business environment based on a strong rule of law are critical ingredients to attracting global businesses.""However, he said the financial impact of these proposed rules is not easy to calculate, even for individual multinationals, given complex taxpayer facts and circumstances.Liew Li Mei, international tax leader at Deloitte, said Singapore offers a proven track record of being stable and predictable and if it continues to do that, multinational companies will continue to operate from Singapore even after their tax incentives expire.""It is therefore imperative that Singapore continues to strengthen its attractiveness for inbound investments – global connectivity, political stability, pro-business environment, diverse talent pool and importantly, the innovative and resilient spirit of Singapore – to ensure that we remain one of the top choice investment destinations."" - The Straits Times/Asia News Network"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",6:17 PM MYT,Asean+,,Singapore team invents new AI tool which could speed up diagnosis of heart disease,"SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): A new tool has been invented by researchers in Singapore which could lead to faster diagnosis of heart disease.Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), it uses electrocardiograms (ECGs) and had an accuracy rate of 98.5 percent. ECGs measure the electrical activity of heartbeats to detect heart abnormalities.Almost one of three deaths in Singapore in 2019 was due to heart disease or stroke, figures from the Singapore Heart Foundation show. The number of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease in Singapore has also increased from 2017 to 2019.Early detection can also prevent complications such as kidney disease.Invented by a team from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) and the National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS), the new diagnostic tool uses an AI machine learning algorithm that enables computers to learn from past experiences like a human.The algorithm trains the tool to recognise patterns in patients' ECGs by inputting examples of ECG signals that reflect cardiovascular diseases.In a pilot study, the researchers used the tool to analyse ECG signals from 92 healthy individuals as well as seven patients with coronary artery disease, 148 who had suffered a heart attack and 15 with congestive heart failure.The data were taken from four public databases.The team found that the AI tool could identify ECG signals associated with healthy people and patients with the three different cardiovascular diseases with an accuracy of more than 98.5 per cent.The study was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Computers in Biology and Medicine in May.""Although confirming the specific disease still requires additional testing, our diagnostic tool will allow physicians to triage patients more efficiently and to streamline the number and type of downstream confirmatory tests,"" said Clinical Associate Professor Tan Ru San, senior consultant at the Department of Cardiology in NHCS, who co-authored the study.Associate Professor Eddie Ng Yin Kwee from NTU's School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who co-led the study, added that the diagnostic tool could lead to advancements in merging AI with medical solutions.The tool is still in the preliminary stages of research and will need to be validated with more data.The team plans to start conducting further trials with a larger database from local hospitals within 18 to 24 months to validate its clinical use.Assoc Prof Tan said: ""This is very exciting but we must also tamper our enthusiasm with reality...this is only the beginning.""He added: ""We can always refine the technique and there may be nice tricks that the team can actually do, but we think this is really a promising start.""Dr Daniel Yeo, a cardiologist at Apex Heart Clinic in Gleneagles Hospital, welcomed the development, saying the new AI tool would help doctors, nurses and other allied healthcare professionals identify abnormal ECGs and make more confident assessments.""The number of cardiologists is small, and they cannot read every single ECG done. This AI tool will therefore be useful in the general practice setting, such as a large and busy polyclinic,"" said Dr Yeo, who hopes the cost of using the tool would not be too high.Dr Paul Ong, a cardiologist at Heart Specialist International in Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre, added that the AI tool could help those who lack specialist knowledge quickly identify patients with cardiac emergencies in ambulances or emergency departments, though it is also important to not over rely on AI to make the diagnosis and miss out on the patient's history and examination findings.The research team hopes the tool could complement current techniques of diagnosing heart diseases, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).They said the tool could also be extended to detect other heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular rhythm in a person's heart.They added it could also be used with wearable devices such as smart watches for the monitoring of heart conditions in patients in future. - The Straits Times/Asia News Network"

Cubes of ice are manufactured by machines and there is no human contact after they are sealed in bags.“Dessert or beverage stalls that usually use crushed ice can switch to using packaged ice in smaller tubes or cubes, ” he added.“Restaurants that use crushed ice to keep their meat and ingredients fresh can cover the ice with plastic first, so the food does not touch the ice directly.” - The Nation/Asia News Network"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",5:26 PM MYT,Asean+,,A tiff with Indonesia's main political family threatens to eclipse a rising star,"JAKARTA (The Straits Times/ANN): When Parliamentary Speaker Puan Maharani, the daughter of former president Megawati Sukarnoputri, arrived at the headquarters of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) in Semarang, Central Java, on May 22, it was to meet 100 party leaders including district heads in person and online.Included on the agenda: awarding a 10 million rupiah (US$700) prize, as well as Puan's autograph, to the winner of a photo competition, and discussing a plan to grow vegetables at the party's headquarters.The invite list included members of the legislative assembly and representative party elders but explicitly stated that Central Java Governor, Ganjar Pranowo, was not invited.The incident underscores the increasingly strained relationship between Ganjar, 52, and his party despite a slew of opinion polls in recent months that suggest he might be the top contender to replace President Joko Widodo at elections in 2024.For his part, Ganjar says the ""viral story"" doesn't faze him.""It doesn't affect my work. All PDI-P party officials already know that we have to do our own portion of work. Be it as a governor, mayor or in parliament. You do the best at your job and no need to think of anything else,"" Ganjar told The Straits Times in an interview on June 3.""The decision in regards to candidates for higher office falls to our party leader,"" Ganjar told ST during the interview over Zoom from Semarang, referring to Megawati.Ganjar declined to comment on whether he is eyeing the presidency.Even so, three years into his second and final term as governor of the country's third-largest province by population, the escalating row with his party leadership, and the family of Indonesia's independence leader Sukarno, threatens to overshadow years of work touting his province's relatively low wages, infrastructure and improving governance.Since he entered office, Central Java's gross domestic product has soared by a third when measured by 2010 prices. Foreign direct investment jumped nearly fourfold during the four years to 2019 before halving in 2020 owing to the pandemic.In 2016 he helped shepherd into being the 2, 200 hectare Kendal Industrial Zones - a joint venture between Singapore's Sembcorp Development and Indonesia's Jababeka, both industrial estate developers. It has so far netted nearly half a billion US dollars in investment.New transport infrastructure such as the Trans Java expressway completed in December 2018, abundant power thanks to a new 2000MW coal fired power plant which went into operation last year, and monthly wages that can be little more than half of what is paid at industrial parks elsewhere on the island, have been a big draw for investors.""When it comes to labour wages, we're competitive,"" Ganjar said.""This is what's pushing investment here.""Ganjar swept to power in 2013, on the Javanese slogan ""Boten korupsi dan boten ngapusi"" - No corruption, no deception. He rose to prominence helped by his carefully honed image as a reformer.Senior bureaucrats were required to report their wealth to the graft watchdog, the Corruption Eradication Commission.Leveraging off his 3.4 million followers on Instagram and 1.9 million on Twitter he invited members of the public to report suspected graft, including instances of civil servants demanding bribes from underlings in return for a promotion.A 2014 video of him confronting an unscrupulous toll bridge operator who was pocketing fares has been viewed at least 7 million times on YouTube.But his use of social media has put him in the cross hairs of some members of the party, who accuse him of grandstanding. At a gathering last week, Ms Megawati chastised party members who ""do too little to help the party"" without naming Mr Ganjar.Even so, should Ganjar run, opinion surveys suggest he would be competitive.Last month, in its first publicly available poll since the 2019 election, the Institute for Social and Economic Research, Education and Information (LP3ES) said Mr Ganjar ranked third with the support of 10 per cent of 1, 200 respondents, out of a field of 19 potential candidates.Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan took 16 per cent, followed by Defence Minister and two time presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto with 13 per cent. Puan ranked 15th with 0.5 per cent.Other polls last month from Kompas Research and Indicator Politik indicate similar rankings for the men.LP3ES director Fajar Nursahid said Ganjar may have the most potential. Prabowo has twice failed to win the presidency, while Anies' backing by religious conservatives at the 2017 Jakarta election has earned him the ire of a large chunk of voters.""Pak Anies attracts a lot of negative sentiment,"" Fajar told ST.""If Ganjar can increase his name recognition outside Central Java, his level of support can increase and increase dramatically.""For now his party has other ideas.Puan as the party's nominee for president with Governor Baswedan as her running mate.Agus Riwanto, a political analyst and lecturer at the Sebelas Maret University in Surakarta reckons Ganjar will struggle to retain his standing with the media once he leaves office a full year before the 2024 election.""He won't be able to blow up the media like he's been able to until now,"" Agus told ST.""The advantage will slip to party elites like Puan."" - The Straits Times/Asia News Network"

His village has since undergone five rounds of nucleic acid tests.Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Foshan at different times have launched mass testing after reporting infections. Zhongshan and Jiangmen - two cities in Guangdong that have yet to report any cases - also initiated mass testing earlier this week as a precautionary step.Singapore, since the weekend, has barred short-term visitors who have been to Guangdong within the last 21 days.For June 7, China reported 33 new coronavirus cases on the mainland, up from 19 cases a day earlier, the health authority said on Tuesday.Of the new cases, 19 were local transmissions from Guangdong, the National Health Commission said.China also reported 16 new asymptomatic infections, compared with 21 a day earlier.

CCTV did not reveal the official's name.The official said that experts have confirmed the safety and efficacy of giving Covid-19 vaccines to that age group. After relevant approval, the vaccination will start for the age group as the country shifts from vaccinating older people to younger ones.On the same day, Zeng Yixin, deputy director of the National Health Commission (NHC), confirmed in an interview with the Xinhua News Agency that China aims to give Covid-19 shots to at least 70 per cent of its population by year-end.Chinese vaccine experts reached by the Global Times on Monday said vaccinating children above three years old is key for the country to reach herd immunity.But to address safety concerns, the country will cautiously use the vaccines among this age group, by distinguishing them into different groups by age or by initially vaccinating minors living in regions more susceptible to the virus, such as Guangzhou.Apart from some concerns about giving vaccines to minors, restrictions for the large-scale vaccination of children mainly come from the tight supply of Covid-19 vaccines in China, which are being pressured by increasing domestic and foreign demand, as well as the possible mass adoption of booster shots, experts said.The approval fits the world trend of lowering the vaccination age to teenagers, and it makes China the first country in the world to give Covid-19 shots to children as young as three years old, an immunologist based in Beijing told the Global Times on condition of anonymity on Monday.China authorised the emergency use of CoronaVac, the Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by Chinese firm Sinovac, for children aged between three and 17, Sinovac Chairman Yin Weidong told the media on Friday.Feng Duojia, president of the China Vaccine Industry Association, told the Global Times on Monday that approval for Sinopharm's vaccine is also on the way.Following China, Thailand is considering whether to lower the age for Sinovac vaccines to three years old. The Southeast Asian country launched a mass vaccination plan on Monday.Canada was the first country to approve vaccines for children aged 12 and above on May 5. Since then, countries including the US, the UK and Singapore approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for use in children aged 12 to 15, after a review of safety and effectiveness, reports said.Besides Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna is also actively studying the use of the vaccine in younger children. Young children, even toddlers, could also be eligible by the end of the year, Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the US, was quoted as saying by US media.""Children aged three to 17 are part of the target group of the national vaccination plan, and a key group for the country to reach herd immunity.""I believe children should receive doses the same as adults, as no solid evidence demonstrates the risk for children is any higher than for adults,"" Tao Lina, a vaccine expert based in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Monday.The use of Covid-19 vaccines on children remains controversial since there has yet to be any open and solid data in clinical trials on children.Some questions also linger, such as whether it is necessary to make children take the risk, as some argue this age group is not susceptible to Covid-19 to the same degree as adults.An immunologist based in Beijing told the Global Times that the possible risks to children cannot be denied, but they are still a key group for the country to reach herd immunity.Thus, to ease public concerns, China is expected to roll out the programme among children step-by-step, either distinguishing them by ages or by grades, or by giving relatively smaller doses of vaccines designated for children.""As China starts vaccination among children, vaccines and the vaccination plan can always be optimised and adjusted, to fix emerging problems, including security concerns,"" he said.The immunologist said China is more likely to start giving shots for the young when Sinopharm also gets the go-ahead for child recipients by authorities, because the priority for the current phase is to further expand inoculations among adults, due to tight vaccine production capacity.Feng said that China will gradually prompt vaccinations of children, but not all at once, because there is huge demand from both overseas and domestic, as well as preparations for a booster shot.""China's total vaccine production basically meets the daily administered doses across the nation, about 20 million doses. In some places, vaccines are immediately out of stock on the same day of distribution,"" Feng said.China had administered 777 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines as of Sunday, according to the NHC. - Global Times"

The junta has branded its opponents ""terrorists"".China's state-run Global Times newspaper has quoted junta Min Aung Hlaing leader as telling the Chinese ambassador that Myanmar was willing to coordinate implementation of the consensus.After Monday's meeting, Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said Chinese help would be ""highly appreciated as this will contribute to achieving a peaceful solution"".A shadow government formed by anti-coup opponents criticised China's embassy in Myanmar for calling the junta chief the ""leader"" of Myanmar on a posting on its website."

The diversification in different asset classes, markets, as well as currencies, continues to provide income stability and added value to the fund’s overall returns.During the first quarter, its overseas investments generated an income of RM11.15bil, or 58% of the total gross investment income recorded, mainly driven by foreign equities.By asset class, fixed income instruments made up 46% of investments, while equities comprised 44%.Money market instruments and real estate and infrastructure made up 4%and 6%, respectively, of investments.The portfolio reflects the EPF’s diversification strategy to optimise returns within tolerable risk limits as guided by the Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA).To date, a total of RM57.97bil of i-Sinar withdrawals have been approved for 6.49 million applicants, out of which RM50.93bil have been disbursed, while RM20.80bil has been paid out to 5.27 million members under the i-Lestari facility.Amir said EPF’s disciplined investment approach and robust liquidity management guided by the SAA has been successful in minimising the impact of the substantial disbursements on the EPF’s portfolio, allowing it to sustain a steady performance in trying times.""This reflects the fund’s commitment to safeguarding our members’ retirement savings by preserving and enhancing the value of those savings while ensuring that their short-term needs are met without compromising their long-term interests,” he said.“While the EPF remains cautious for the coming quarter, given the downside risks of the new highly transmissible Covid-19 variants, we assure members that we continuously take the necessary measures to protect members' savings, supported by our strong governance framework, as we strive to meet our mandate and strategic targets of providing members with a sustainable retirement.”"

Furthermore, the high proportion of fully vaccinated individuals in the U.S. at 42% has reduced the anxieties around Covid-19 and is supportive of RWLV's business ramp-up for the rest of 2021, ” it said.S&P said similarly, revenue from Genting's New York operations in the first quarter of 2021 returned to 70% of pre-pandemic levels and the US operations could now recover faster than we had expected given operating hours normalized from April.Genting's UK operations also restarted in mid-May after a long closure since the middle of last year.“We believe Genting is striving to control its negative discretionary cash flow by adding flexibility in its investment plans and contemplating plans to dispose non-core assets.“Following the completion of its Malaysian theme park and RWLV, its main pending project is the Resorts World Sentosa 2.0 expansion.“While this would continue to elevate the company's investment plans, we expect the timing and level of investments to be partly dependent on current operational conditions. The group's large cash balance will support its ongoing expansionary spending and periods of negative discretionary cash flows, ” it said.Genting's asset disposal plans include Genting Malaysia Bhd.'s (BBB/Negative/--) planned disposal of a U.K. hotel, which we expect to be completed in the first half of this year.The rating agency said the report does not constitute a rating action."

The transaction is targeted to complete before the end of the year,” FGV and MSM said in a joint statement today.MSM group chief executive officer Syed Feizal Syed Mohammad said an extraordinary income would be realised as part of the proposed disposal with an estimated gain of RM91.6 million.""It is also to enhance our operational front particularly on utilisation factor and yield improvement in MSM Sugar Refinery (Johor) Sdn Bhd (MSM Johor).""Aside from the disposal, the accelerated planned rectification works at MSM Johor will also support MSM’s target to reach a minimum UF rate of 50 percent by the third quarter of the year,” Syed Feizal said.Meanwhile, FGV has earmarked the 11 parcels of agricultural and industrial land owned by MSM Perlis for the development of the FGV Chuping Agro Valley (FCAV) by FGVIF, a new sector under the group.The development would consist of high-value integrated cash crop plantation activities such as MD2 pineapples and harumanis mangoes, as well as dairy farming, it said.FGV Group’s officer-in-charge and group divisional director of logistics and support businesses sector, Azman Ahmad, said the group was looking forward to the development and expansion of the FCAV project in order to realise FGVIF’s strategic initiatives.""This is in line with the government’s proposition to bolster the domestic economic sector and provide employment opportunities in efforts to reduce the impact of the pandemic,” he said.To date, the group has hired more than 50 employees and field workers for the project, and in addition, a total area of 60 hectares have been allocated for the agropreneurs programme under the contract farming scheme for the MD2 pineapple project.""The first batch of agropreneurs recruitment is expected to be in July 2021.""FGVIF has already commenced the ground work of 1,200 hectares of MD2 pineapple plantation where we target to complete the development by the year 2025,” added Azman.Since the cessation of sugar cane plantation, MSM Perlis continued to manage the agricultural land with rubber, oil palm and mango plantations, but due to unsustainable performance associated with high operating costs of maintaining plantation activities, it ceased the plantation sector on June 30, 2019.Meanwhile, MSM Perlis’ sugar refinery operations were discontinued a year later following MSM’s capacity rationalisation to consolidate the production in the new refinery, MSM Johor.The unfavourable location of MSM Perlis (distance from ports), its small capacity and high-cost facility had caused the operations to be uneconomical, the statement said. - Bernama"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",2:10 PM MYT,Asean+,,"Gangrene, hearing loss show Delta variant may be more severe","MUMBAI (Bloomberg): The coronavirus variant driving India’s devastating Covid-19 second wave is the most infectious to emerge so far. Doctors now want to know if it’s also more severe.Hearing impairment, severe gastric upsets and blood clots leading to gangrene, symptoms not typically seen in Covid patients, have been linked by doctors in India to the so-called delta variant. In England and Scotland, early evidence suggests the strain -- which is also now dominant there -- carries a higher risk of hospitalisation.Delta, also known as B.1.617.2, has spread to more than 60 countries over the past six months and triggered travel curbs from Australia to the US.A spike in infections, fuelled by the delta variant, has forced UK to reconsider its plans for reopening later this month, with a local report saying it may be pushed back by two weeks.Higher rates of transmission and a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines have made understanding the strain’s effects especially critical.""We need more scientific research to analyse if these newer clinical presentations are linked to B.1.617 or not, ” said Abdul Ghafur, an infectious disease physician at the Apollo Hospital in Chennai, southern India’s largest city. Ghafur said he is seeing more Covid patients with diarrhea now than in the initial wave of the pandemic.""Last year, we thought we had learned about our new enemy, but it changed, ” Ghafur said.""This virus has become so, so unpredictable.”Stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hearing loss and joint pain are among the ailments Covid patients are experiencing, according to six doctors treating patients across India.The beta and gamma variants -- first detected in South Africa and Brazil respectively -- have shown little or no evidence of triggering unusual clinical signs, according to a study by researchers from the University of New South Wales last month.Some patients develop micro thrombi, or small blood clots, so severe that they led affected tissue to die and develop gangrene, said Ganesh Manudhane, a Mumbai cardiologist, who has treated eight patients for thrombotic complications at the Seven Hills Hospital during the past two months. Two required amputations of fingers or a foot.""I saw three-to-four cases the whole of last year, and now it’s one patient a week, ” Manudhane said.India has reported 18.6 million Covid cases thus far in 2021, compared with 10.3 million last year. The delta variant was the ""primary cause” behind the country’s deadlier second wave and is 50% more contagious than the alpha strain that was first spotted in the UK, according to a recent study by an Indian government panel.The surge in cases may have driven an increase in the frequency with which rare Covid complications are being observed. Even still, Manudhane said he is baffled by the blood clots he’s seeing in patients across age groups with no past history of coagulation-related problems.""We suspect it could be because of the new virus variant, ” he said. Manudhane is collecting data to study why some people develop the clots and others don’t.Doctors are also finding instances of clots forming in blood vessels that supply the intestines, causing patients to experience stomach pain -- their only symptom, local media have reported.Some Covid patients are also seeking medical care for hearing loss, swelling around the neck and severe tonsillitis, said Hetal Marfatia, an ear nose and throat surgeon at Mumbai’s King Edward Memorial Hospital.""Every person is showing different symptoms” in the second wave, she said.The unusual presentations for delta and a closely related variant known as kappa, whose spread led to a fourth lockdown in the Australian city of Melbourne, are still being confirmed, said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. ""In the meanwhile, it is important to take note of this and be aware of possible atypical presentations, ” she said.The most alarming aspect of the current outbreak in India is the rapidity with which the virus is spreading, including to children, said Chetan Mundada, a paediatrician with the Yashoda group of hospitals in Hyderabad.Apollo’s Ghafur said he was also seeing entire families with Covid symptoms, unlike last year when individuals dominated, reflecting an increase in household transmission caused by the delta variant.Cases of Mucormycosis -- a rare opportunistic fungal infection -- have also been surging in India. It had infected more than 8,800 Covid patients and survivors as of May 22, forcing local health care authorities to call it an epidemic.Even as India’s outbreak begins to ease -- daily infections have slipped to less than a quarter of the May 7 peak -- the delta variant is sparking outbreaks elsewhere, including hitherto virus havens such as Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, bolstering calls for mass immunisation.German politician and scientist Karl Lauterbach said Tuesday the variant will probably become more prevalent in Germany too in the coming months.""To avoid it completely seems unrealistic to me, ” he said on Twitter in German.""The decisive factor is a very high vaccination rate, which reduces mortality.”But with emerging evidence delta and at least one other variant may be adept at evading vaccine-induced antibodies, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to tweak existing shots or develop new ones.""New vaccines have to prepared with new variants in mind, ” said Ghafur.""We can’t get ahead of the virus, but at least we can least keep up with it.”"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",2:05 PM MYT,Asean+,MARTIN JACQUES,Comment: G7 no longer able to order world around,"Global Times, June 8 - Fine words will accompany the G7 summit this week. Much will be promised. And little will be delivered. It has long been like this. The G7 is no longer fit for purpose.Comprising the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan, in the 1970s the G7 was the overlord of the global economy. Today, the G7 is but a pale shadow of what it once was, reduced to the role of a declining faction within the global economy. It still talks in grandiose terms about its intentions, but the world has learnt to discount them. It is entirely appropriate that this week's summit will be chaired by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a grandmaster of verbal exaggeration and empty gestures.The role and importance of the G7 has been greatly diminished by the rise of the developing world. The latter now accounts for almost two-thirds of the global economy compared with one-third by the West: in the 1970s, it was exactly the opposite, the West enjoying a two-third share and the developing world just one-third. The most dramatic illustration of the G7's waning authority came in 2008 when, at the height of the financial crisis, it was effectively displaced by the more representative G20.Ever since, the G7 has increasingly become an institution in search of a role. Under Biden, as if to confirm its eclipse as a global institution, there is an ongoing attempt to reframe G7 as the representative and champion of the democratic world in the struggle against autocracy, to this end, South Korea, India, Australia and South Africa have been invited to attend the G7 summit this week. There is even talk of the G7 becoming the D10 (D being a reference to democracy). This, however, would only serve to emphasize the declining authority of the G7: from global leader to ideological sect.The truth, however, is that this proposal is unlikely to gain assent either among existing G7 members or potential new members, excepting perhaps Australia. Here we get to the heart of the crisis of the G7. It is the rise of China, above all else, that has transformed the global economy, sidelined the G7 and, at the same time, reconfigured the various G7 economies. Good relations with China are fundamental to the economic prospects of Germany, France and Italy. That is why they are opposed to the G7 becoming an anti-China crusade. So is Japan; and likewise would-be recruits such as South Korea and South Africa. Here laid bare, then, are the fault lines of the G7 and any potential extended membership. The West is divided and fragmenting. The authority of the US is in decline, no longer able to get its way as it once was.The best illustration of the growing impotence of the G7 concerns its relationship with the developing world. For eight years, the West has been trying to find a way of responding to the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The subject is due to be raised again at this week's G7 summit. All the ideas that have been offered as a basis of a Western alternative to BRI have come to nought. This failure is extraordinarily significant and most revealing about the West on the one hand and China on the other.BRI is an eloquent articulation of China's relationship with the developing world, rooted in its own semi-colonial past and its position as a developing country. The West, in contrast, has failed because its history has been precisely the opposite, one of colonization and the exploitation and subjugation of these countries. It has neither the experience, empathy nor motivation that is required. The existential gap between the rich Western world and the developing world is a multidimensional chasm.A dramatic example of the West's indifference to the needs of the developing world will be on full display at the G7 summit. Although the US and UK, and increasingly Western Europe, have vaccinated a majority of their populations against COVID-19, the UK, to take one example, has not exported a single dose of vaccine to the developing world. It has kept all its vaccines for itself, even though its existing stock far exceeds its own future needs. As each new variant spreads around the world, however, it has become patently clear to everyone that no country will be protected until every country is protected.In a pandemic, no country is an island. The US, which has so far failed to export a single dose of vaccine, is promising to export 80 million doses of vaccines later this year. Compare this with China's record. In addition to the 777 million vaccinations already carried out in China, it has exported more than 300 million doses of vaccines to the developing world. Over half the vaccinations in Latin America, for example, have been sourced by China. It seems all too likely that the West will fail in its moral responsibility to vaccinate the developing world until it is too late and many millions have died unnecessarily.The author was until recently a Senior Fellow at the Department of Politics and International Studies at Cambridge University.

But everybody knows there is a risk. It’s 100 per cent impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk...of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics,"" the Times quoted Oshitani as telling the newspaper.""There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics (an occasion) to spread the virus to these countries,"" he added, noting most countries lack vaccines.Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on July 23 despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources.However, a former Olympian turned public health expert said she believed the Games can be pulled off with an acceptable level of risk.""There will be cases, but having one case or a couple of cases doesn't mean that it was a failure,"" Tara Kirk Sell, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Reuters on Tuesday.PRAYING FOR PANDEMIC RELIEFPlaybooks from event organisers detailing testing regimes and movement restrictions for athletes and other visitors ""outline a good strategy"" for minimising contagion, Sell added.Media arriving from abroad to cover the Games will be closely monitored to ensure they don't leave pre-registered areas such as hotels and sports venues, Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said. She also said Japan's Olympics-related staff were expected to start getting vaccinated in mid-June.""... we are still in a very difficult situation, but we have seen a gradual decrease of infections in Tokyo, and I am praying that the pandemic is brought under control as swiftly as possible,"" Hashimoto said at the start of a Tokyo 2020 board meeting.Japan has been spared the explosive outbreaks seen elsewhere but has recorded over 760,000 cases and more than 13,600 deaths. Tokyo and other regions are under a state of emergency as the nation battles a fourth wave which is straining hospitals.The government's top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, said last week medical experts planned a statement on the Games by June 20, when the state of emergency is set to be lifted.A labour union in the northern island of Hokkaido, where the Olympic marathon will be held, petitioned its governor on Monday calling for the Games to be cancelled, media said.Japanese Olympic Committee board member Kaori Yamaguchi, a judo bronze medallist at the 1988 Games, said on Friday Japan had been ""cornered"" into pressing ahead with the Games.Japan's public remains divided about holding the Games, although opposition appears to be easing somewhat.

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",2:16 PM MYT,Sport,ELAINE LIES,Factbox-Tokyo Olympics in the shadow of coronavirus,"TOKYO (Reuters) - As the clock ticks down to the opening of the Tokyo Olympics on July 23, Japan is preparing to host a Games like no other in history, as it grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.Although the global situation has improved from a year ago, when the Games were postponed for the first time except for war, flare-ups of the disease worldwide mean organisers must hold the sporting extravaganza under strict rules to limit its spread.Here is a look at the circumstances of these unprecedented Olympics, the second time Tokyo has hosted them since 1964.SPECTATORSForeign spectators have been banned, and organisers are expected to make a decision late this month on domestic spectators.Toshiaki Endo, vice president of the Tokyo organising committee, told Reuters some spectators could be allowed into venues, although he personally preferred a total ban to calm persistent public opposition to the Games.The government is considering requiring those who attend to show either negative COVID-19 test results or vaccination records, media said. Bans on loud cheering or high-fives are among other possible steps.PUBLIC OPINIONWhile recent opinion polls show some shift towards approval for the Games, earlier surveys revealed that 60% to 80% of respondents would have liked them either cancelled or postponed again. However, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said the findings will not affect plans to hold the Games.The Games have already lost meaning and Japan has been ""cornered"" into pressing ahead, Kaori Yamaguchi, a member of the country's Olympic panel and a judo medallist, wrote in an opinion piece this month.BUSINESS ATTITUDESBy the end of May, a growing number of investors in Japanese stocks believed that cancelling the Games would be better for the market. At the same time, a Reuters survey found that nearly 70 percent of businesses also wanted either another postponement or cancellation.Many sponsors are uncertain how to proceed with advertising campaigns or marketing events because they do not know if domestic spectators will be allowed into the venues, sources at companies directly involved in sponsorship told Reuters.Some business leaders have been even more outspoken. In May, Hiroshi Mikitani, who heads e-commerce giant Rakuten Group Inc, said Japan's low vaccination rate made it a ""suicide mission"" to host the Games.MEDICAL SITUATIONDoctors have warned that the Games' need for medical staff could pressure a healthcare system already stressed by caring for virus patients, and officials in some areas have said they would not prioritise Olympics-related patients.Organisers, though, said in late May they had lined up about 80% of the staff needed, with target numbers cut about a third from 10,000 originally.Organisers are working with 10 hospitals in Tokyo and 20 outside the capital to ensure response to emergencies.Repeated warnings on the Olympics from the government's top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, have included remarks to parliament in early June that holding the Games during a pandemic was ""not normal"".(Reporting by Elaine Lies; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",3:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Coronavirus has ushered in a new era of air-conditioning in cars,"Disturbing odours, annoying pollen and now virus-laden aerosols: drivers value clean air inside their car more than ever, especially since the beginning of the pandemic.The car industry has long since picked up on this trend and is coming up with more and more elaborate air-conditioning systems.Mercedes’ new electric model EQS, for example, has an innovative air-conditioner in the front, in a space occupied by the engine in conventional cars.Here, the manufacturer has installed a so-called Hepa filter which provides clinical air quality like in an operating room, according to Mercedes.The EQS boot has a volume of 610 to 1,770 litres, more than any other Mercedes S-Class model and more than enough to make up for the lost storage space in the front. However, the placement also shows the importance now attributed to air conditioning.Filter capacity: 150 football fields“While this was initially a very big issue in Asia in particular, it has also become a top priority in the rest of the world since the coronavirus at the latest, ” says Mercedes’ Christoph Starzynski, justifying the installation of a filter that is larger than a crate of beer and separates 99.65% of particles of all sizes on a surface the size of 150 football fields.But Mercedes isn’t the only manufacturer that has ramped up the fight against dirty air. For years, developers were concerned with the perfect distribution of air flows in the car and the most individualised comfort zones possible for each occupant.But now it’s increasingly about purity: modern air-conditioning systems detect air quality and automatically activate recirculation mode, they ionize the air flow to eliminate odours, and they are now filtering out ever smaller particles as well.Regulating clean air via your smartphoneBritish manufacturer Rolls-Royce, for example, claims it has installed the first automatic climate control system with a nanoparticle filter in its new Ghost model last year, a system that since this spring has also been available for some luxury models at BMW.“This technology makes it possible to keep certain microbial particles and allergens out of the vehicle interior in addition to ultra-fine dust, ” says press spokesperson Bernhard Ederer.In recirculation mode, the interior is thus cleaned of almost all particles beyond the usual level. And the driver doesn’t even have to be in the car to switch it on. Thanks to remote access via an app, the air-conditioning system can be programmed accordingly even before you start driving.But clean air is also increasingly available in lower-price ranges. Japanese manufacturer Honda, for example, has launched an interior filter which can be purchased additionally and installed by an authorized dealer.The device “effectively filters, captures and suppresses toxic environmental gases as well as inorganic and biological particles and aerosols, ” according to Honda.Maintenance and additional consumption – but it’s worth itWhile manufacturers have been doing the most to increase air quality inside the car, drivers still have to do their part, says Hans-Georg Marmit from the KUeS car expert association.“Because an air conditioning system is only as good as its maintenance, ” warns the expert, referring emphatically to the manufacturers’ service intervals, during which coolant is checked and filters are replaced.A little extra cost during operation must also be factored in since the air conditioner increases consumption by up to 2 litres, depending on load and performance.But this is money well spent and not only because air conditioners protect against viruses, pollen and bad odours and prevent fungal growth in the car’s windpipes, says Marmit: “Especially in summer, activating the air conditioning is absolutely necessary to ensure the driver’s ability to concentrate.” – dpa/Thomas Geiger"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",2:05 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,"US teacher emerges as TikTok star, eyes Hollywood career","In the jargon of the internet, Casey Hamilton is chaotic good.He is the human embodiment of “dance like no one’s watching, ” with a disarming wholesomeness bred in his native Plant City, Florida.The 25-year-old dresses like a flamboyant nine-year-old with a credit card and no parental supervision, and makes it look good, right down to his trademark pink Crocs festooned with Jibbitz, the little cartoon character-shaped charms he adds to the rubber shoes’ ventilation holes.Hamilton is actually a lot like a pair of Crocs: comforting, immediately funny, utterly unpretentious, and actually pretty great if you can get over yourself.His TikTok account, @mrhamilton, has 5.6 million followers, and a lot of energy. He does voices. Maybe a spot-on Plankton from SpongeBob SquarePants, or the “how it feels to chew 5 gum” guy talking about how it feels to run a meth lab. Maybe an impression of the neighbor who knocked on his door to randomly offer him an entire ham.It feels unplanned, and his girlfriend, Jordyn Maloney (who he met on TikTok), says that’s authentic. He just picks up the phone and goes when the mood strikes, like when she watched him try Mexican Coca-Cola for the first time and he shocked her by suddenly reciting the entire Pledge of Allegiance in Spanish, in a flawless soccer announcer voice.He sings. Maybe an unironic All Star by Smash Mouth, a cover of Hey, Delilah that is actually about a stripper, or a jingle for pizza rolls that is actually about depression. His dance moves are joyous — ever seen someone move their body like a computer printer? — and his non-sequiturs are of the utterly weird, or screamed, variety.It’s enough to get him recognised in Walmart, as “Mr. Hamilton, ” or maybe, “Hey, aren’t you the TikTok guy?, ” which still seems to be blowing his mind a little bit.On a recent afternoon he visited the Plant City post office to check his P.O. box and found it packed with fan mail. People send T-shirts, stickers featuring Hamilton’s own face, containers of human teeth.“I never expected it to turn into this, ” he said. “I made my account as a tool for teaching.”Hamilton was a talented TV production teacher, even if the Plant City High School morning show, which his students produced, pushed the envelope a little bit. Under his watch, there were more sketches and more humor, rather than just the standard school news.“I don’t think it was everyone’s cup of tea. You might turn it on and see a kid biting into a hot pepper or something, ” said Jennifer Hamilton, Hamilton’s mother and a longtime teacher at the high school. “But he turned our TV show around, because the students appreciated the humour and would actually pay attention to the other things on the show because of it.”Hamilton would also appear in sketches alongside his students. It was another aspect some at the school weren’t sure about, but it belied his desire to perform.“In hindsight it makes sense, ” Hamilton said. “I’d put my dream on hold, and I didn’t even know it.”Hamilton has lived his whole life in Plant City, where going to the grocery store means running into your fourth grade teacher or your mum’s sister’s nurse or the guy you were in Boy Scouts with. He says he was always a big personality for the small town and, as a “loud and dramatic” child, learned to walk a line so as not to aggravate people.He was the only kindergartener to compete at an annual storytelling contest at his school, and even at six he would do voices for all the characters in the kids book Tikki Tikki Tembo.In middle school, his parents were uneasy when he came home and announced that he wanted ― “absolutely needed, ” says his mother — to attend a live production of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. They finally relented, and his father took him.In high school he insisted on a Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man backpack even though his mum was pushing a sensible Jansport.He found the other weird kid in class, Brian Ross, and made him his best friend.Hamilton and Ross would park at the RaceTrac gas station after school, crank up Diplo on the car stereo and dance in the lot until the cashier wanted to join in. There wasn’t much else to do.Hamilton played the lion in The Wizard of Oz and the plant in Little Shop Of Horrors and thrived. It might seem like he’s playing around on TikTok, said Ross, “but he is an amazing singer”.Hamilton earned an English degree from the University of South Florida and got the teaching job after the outgoing TV teacher, Hamilton’s own teacher when he’d gone there, recommended him.He adored his students, and they adored having a young instructor who danced in class and might blow an occasional air horn at a sleeping classmate. But Hamilton wasn’t managing his anxiety well, and fell into a habit of drinking nightly and gaining an unhealthy amount of weight.It was shortly before the start of the pandemic that he created the TikTok account. In early videos he gets extremely excited about watching Guy Fieri on TV and says “It’s spring break, baby” over and over and with increasing fervor until the words devolve into a sound like a boiling bullfrog.He went viral the first time by combining Megan Thee Stallion’s Savage lyrics with Patrick the starfish from SpongeBob SquarePants.In April 2020, he issued a challenge to Grammy-winning singer Lizzo to sing what he sang, and then scatted for 20 seconds in an over-the-top way. Soon he hit 300,000 followers. Then he got Lizzo to laugh at that video and repost it, which bumped him to 400,000 in a day.Last June, his students dropped off a “one Hamillion” cake at his apartment to congratulate him on a million followers.Hamilton felt hopeful. He dropped weight. He found a therapist. In one of his most-watched videos, he chokes up while explaining he is wearing a size large shirt for the first time in years, down from an XXXXL.His followers sent money, and expensive supplies for the high school. Hamilton used the money to fund a US$5,000 film scholarship for a former student. Then, fans funded a road trip, #HamTrip2020.Hamilton had rarely left Florida, but spent weeks traveling the country, meeting up with other TikTokers and fans. With the money people sent, he tipped hundreds of dollars to servers at cheap restaurants and documented it on the app.When he headed west, he heard from master impressionist and MADtv star Frank Caliendo, who told Hamilton to stop by his home in Arizona.“I’m there with his wife and his kids and his dogs, and this guy who I’ve watched on MADtv is right there in front of me, one of my heroes of impressions, and he’s doing the Robin Williams voice, ” Hamilton said. “(Caliendo) has done voices for cartoons, and he’s telling me I’ve got the goods.”Caliendo put Hamilton in touch with Phineas And Ferb creator Dan Povenmire, another of his heroes. Soon Hamilton was at Povenmire’s Los Angeles home eating cookies.When Hamilton got back to Plant City, he was thrilled, but torn. He knew what he wanted to do: TikTok, voice work, entertainment — full time. The spark he didn’t realise he was missing was back.He was also terrified of letting his students down, explaining his decision and losing his identity as a teacher. He psyched himself up for the next school year, but when classes started, he couldn’t do it.He told his students. They immediately told him to go. His own parents were more hesitant.“Not everyone gets it, ” Jennifer Hamilton said. “Some of our friends, his grandparents, they don’t understand how he can make money just logging on to this thing and being Casey Hamilton.” It’s partly a small town thing. You think more practically. You don’t know anyone who made it in entertainment. “But ultimately I told him go, do it now while you have the opportunity.”He quit his job. The school played Justin Timberlake’s Suit And Tie, a song he dances to on TikTok, over the intercom on his last day.Since leaving teaching he’s split time between Plant City and San Antonio, Texas, where his girlfriend lives. He’s moving permanently, to be with her, but also to be closer to Los Angeles. He’s auditioning, and recently booked a voice role as a teacher in a cartoon by a major entertainment company.The money, so far, he said, has been about 30% more than his teaching salary. Payouts come via the TikTok Creator Fund. Sometimes that means a US$900 day. Sometimes it’s a US$15 day. Sponsorships pay better. He got around US$15,000 to be the face of Honey Baked Ham’s “ham hacks” for Easter, and he has recorded nearly 1,000 Cameo birthday greetings for US$25 each.“I’m still an amateur, and I recognise that, ” Hamilton said. “But I feel like I’ve got this color wheel of talents and I want to use them.”He thinks about another hero, Chris Farley. The late Saturday Night Live star was known less for his own sketches and more for being incredibly willing to do anything asked of him in someone else’s.“That’s me. That’s the energy I want to bring, ” Hamilton said. “Throw me in, coach.”“If you’re having a bad day, watch my goofy ass for a couple of minutes, ” Hamilton said. “Maybe it’ll alleviate things, what I do is supposed to distract you from the fact that life is what it is.” The former Plant City High teacher said his comedy is inspired by Robin Williams and Chris Farley. – AP"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",1:10 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,World Ocean Day: Turtle clinic in Spain rescues turtles caught in fishing nets,"Divers and turtles have one thing in common: decompression sickness. When caught in the nets of fishermen, turtles are at risk of dying due to an overly quick ascent to the surface. So the Fondation Oceanográfic in Valencia, Spain has developed a system for taking these turtles in and treating them after these fishing accidents.On the occasion of World Oceans Day on June 8, AFP takes a closer look at this process in this feature ""Protecting the planet one step at a time"" in partnership with the NGO Energy Observer Solutions.Welcome to Valencia and the largest aquarium in Europe, which is home to the Fondation Oceanográfic. Four researchers have set up a clinic there to rescue turtles caught up in fishing nets.Global warming causes upset among the turtle populationFor some years, Spain has seen an influx of loggerhead turtles along its shores. With rising temperatures in the Mediterranean, the nesting area for these creatures has gradually shifted across from Greece and Turkey to Spain.With the resulting increase in turtles in Spanish waters, the fishermen are finding an increasing number of these creatures in their nets.Indeed, the turtles surface too quickly and end up suffering from decompression sickness, and the human population does not always know how to react to them when they are disoriented.The Fondation Oceanográfic in Valencia was the first to highlight this issue, which results in the demise of a great many of these creatures.A special clinicTo deal with this situation, the clinic's scientists have invested in a hyperbaric chamber. The chamber enables the team to artificially lower them back down to a depth of water their bodies can cope with. Using this device, the turtles can be completely cured after a period of 12 to 18 hours.Since 2016, the Foundation has rescued around a hundred turtles a year. By raising awareness about their plight and issuing an emergency number for people to call, their rescue process is becoming increasingly effective.Before being released back into the wild, turtles are tagged so as to track their movements in real time and predict where the next egg-laying event will occur.Energy Observer is the name of the first hydrogen-powered, zero-emission vessel to be self-sufficient in energy, advocating and serving as a laboratory for ecological transition.

The U.S. tech giant said in 2019 that rivals would have to pay via an auction for appearing on a choice screen on new Android devices in Europe from which users select their preferred search engine.Google's change of heart followed a 4.24 billion euro ($5.16 billion) fine handed out by the European Commission, the EU antitrust authority, in 2018 for unfairly using Android to cement the dominance of its search engine.""We are now making some final changes to the Choice Screen including making participation free for eligible search providers. We will also be increasing the number of search providers shown on the screen,"" Google director Oliver Bethell wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.The changes will come into effect in September, the blog added.The Commission said it had discussed possible changes with Google following concerns raised by a number of its rivals, adding that those announced were positive developments.Google said the five most popular eligible search engines in each EU country according to StatCounter, including Google, would be displayed in random order at the top of the screen while up to seven will be shown at the bottom.It had previously only allowed four competitors, chosen in separate auctions for each EU country, to be displayed on Android screens.However DuckDuckGo, a rival search engine that has long complained about the auction process, said Google should go further.""Google is now doing what it should have done three years ago: a free search preference menu on Android in the EU,"" CEO Gabriel Weinberg tweeted.""However, it should be on all platforms, eg also desktop Chrome, accessible at all times, ie not just on factory reset, and in all countries.""Search engine Ecosia, which together with four other rivals complained about Google's initial proposal to the Commission last year, welcomed the changes.""With this, we have something that resembles a level playing field in the market,"" its CEO Christian Kroll said in a statement.""Search providers now have a chance to compete more fairly in the Android market, based on the appeal of their product, rather than being shut out by monopolistic behaviour.""($1 = 0.8211 euros)(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Pravin Char and Jan Harvey)"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",2:00 PM MYT,Tech,DANA HULL，GABRIELLE COPPOLA，ED LUDLOW,Telsa executive and top Musk lieutenant has left the company,"Tesla Inc. has parted ways with Jerome Guillen, a 10-year veteran who most recently served as president of heavy trucking and was one of four top executives running the company alongside Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.Guillen left the company June 3, according to a regulatory filing Monday. He was a top lieutenant to Musk and the brains behind the ramp up of Model 3 production in 2018. The executive previously served as president of Tesla’s automotive business, and was named head of heavy trucking in March of this year.""That is a huge and unexpected loss,” Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research who has a buy recommendation on the Tesla shares, said in an email. He added the news is part of a pattern of high-level executive departures at the company. ""Jerome’s contribution to Tesla will remain part of the company and the company will continue to attract other top-guns.”Tesla fell as much as 0.8% in postmarket trading Monday after closing up 1% to US$605.13 (RM2,493.14). The stock is down about 14% this year.Guillen, who is French, joined Tesla in the fall of 2010 as the program director for the Model S, the breakthrough electric vehicle which laid the groundwork for the crossover Model X and more mass market Model 3 that followed. He was 48 years old as of Tesla’s latest annual report.Guillen didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Turnover StruggleTesla has struggled with executive turnover for years. Guillen took a several-months-long leave of absence from the company in 2015 but returned in 2016 to lead the company’s Semi truck program. He was promoted in 2018 to serve as the head of automotive operations.The executive is known for building an assembly line against all odds in a tent outside of Tesla’s auto plant in Fremont, California. The cobbled-together line was instrumental to the company finally delivering on the Model 3, a bet-the-company effort that nearly bankrupted Tesla in 2018.His sudden exit leaves Musk, Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn and Drew Baglino, a senior vice president in charge of powertrain and energy engineering, as the triumvirate atop the company, which has more than 70,000 employees globally.""We thank him for his many contributions and wish him well in his future career,” the electric carmaker said in the filing.Guillen, who previously worked at Daimler AG, briefly appeared on stage when Tesla unveiled the Semi Truck in the fall of 2017. But initial production of the Semi has been delayed and is dependent on new, larger 4680 battery cells that Tesla is trying to make in-house and get from long-time suppliers like Japan’s Panasonic Corp.Musk said via a tweet Sunday that Tesla has canceled plans to build a longer range version of its Model S known as the Plaid +, a vehicle that also was supposed to use the new type of battery.Musk didn’t address whether the availability of the 4680 factored in Tesla’s decision to cancel the upscale version of the flagship sedan. Tesla will debut the standard Plaid model at an event scheduled to take place June 10. – Bloomberg"

He declined to share how much the company was valued at, adding only that Insight Partners received a minority stake.“A large enterprise would have upwards of 50 to 60 systems feeding data into Brinqa. And then Brinqa, it looks at that knowledge, combs it, or correlates it, makes some sense out of it and identifies things that are high risk, medium risk, low risk,” said Fida. The company can then be alerted automatically of any security gaps and in some cases the Brinqa software can change setting on applications to close those gaps, he said.The shortage of cybersecurity talent makes software that can automate a large part of the security work increasingly important, say cybersecurity industry executives."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",3:00 PM MYT,Tech,,"Generation Z are turning to online second hand stores, due price and environmental concerns","The marketplace Etsy has just ponied up US$1.6bil to buy Depop, the British application specialised in second-hand clothes, which has become an essential app among Gen Z.This generation is drawn to second-hand clothing for its budget-friendly prices, but also because it corresponds to their concerns and commitments in terms of the environment, as Florence de Ferran, a professor and researcher in management sciences at the University of La Rochelle, explains.Why are consumers turning to second-hand on a massive scale?I wouldn’t say they’re turning to second-hand on a massive scale. There are indeed several variables that have facilitated the growth of certain types of second-hand commerce.Vinted, for example, is a site that people have been talking a lot about lately.But second-hand is much broader than that. It’s not just on apps or websites. It has existed for a long time through flea markets or other places where people buy second-hand products.It has simply evolved over the last 15 years, especially with the sociological demographic referred to as hipsters, looking for vintage products. This enthusiasm for second-hand goods is not new.For the last two or three years, another demographic, namely young people, have seized on this type of consumption because of environmental concerns.There has been an evolution, because they are now buying second-hand clothes and other products for two reasons: it’s smart from a budgetary point of view, and it’s better for the planet. It’s a different approach.They don’t go to flea markets; for them it’s more about using apps and websites to buy these second-hand products. These days it’s become emblematic for clothing and for everything that is electronic equipment.What are the main reasons for consumers choosing to buy second-hand?The budgetary aspect, i.e., saving money, takes prominence over all else.Most young people buy second-hand because it’s a good deal, because it’s affordable, because they don’t see the point of paying 20% more for a new garment. The financial aspect clearly comes into play.But others also do it because it addresses their environmental concerns. It’s quite a major trend among the younger generations.Is buying fast fashion on second-hand e-commerce sites really better for the environment?Every individual, whoever they are, has their own contradictions. Oftentimes — and probably even more frequently when we are young — we don’t necessarily think about all the implications of our behaviour and we often stop at rather basic rationalisations.I don’t know if this generation really buys fast fashion on second-hand websites, but in any case, there are indeed questions that they aren’t asking themselves.They aren’t necessarily asking themselves, for example, about the fact that buying on Vinted implies a series of logistics, sometimes for just one item of clothing; which is extremely polluting compared to a store where logistics are pooled for many items.Doesn’t this type of second-hand purchasing encourage over-consumption?It depends, there are several cases. If you have low purchasing power, I’m not sure that you will end up buying more.But there is also the idea of buying to resell, so there is a circular process that makes you spend and earn at the same time. The result is that a person can indeed buy at their leisure.But I feel like it’s a phenomenon that’s fairly short-lived, because it takes work and long-term investment. I think it’s something that may be done compulsively but over a period of time that is relatively limited. It is a specific type of behaviour, however, which does not affect all consumers.In recent months, there’s been much talk in the fashion world about second-hand, but also about upcycling, renting clothes, or “returnable” garments. What is the best choice to reduce the sector’s impact on the environment?This is an extremely large question, because we must first ask ourselves if it is a question of reducing our pollution on the environment, or a dimension of our pollution that is the carbon footprint.We must answer this question in order to know which axis it’s possible to take action with. We must then investigate each of the areas of our consumption and arbitrate according to those that are the most costly compared to others.If we want to limit our carbon footprint, which is the most talked-about indicator today, we have to focus our attention on transportation because it is the most polluting for an average consumer.In this case, it is therefore a question of reducing our use of transports, but also of reducing the amount of transportation used by the goods we buy: consume locally, favour the train for travelling over the plane, etc. This is the first aspect which we can adjust to reduce this carbon footprint.Will clothing that is responsibly sourced, ethical and sustainable ever be accessible to a majority of people?Consumption is totally unequal right now. Consumer choices vary greatly according to purchasing power, that’s obvious. It is possible to have access to a small quantity of responsible consumer choices when it comes to food even on a tight budget, but on processed products, such as textiles, it is clearly more complicated and not very accessible.There is, however, one thing in our society that we have lost sight of: and that is knowing what a price really represents.For a long time, we believed that good quality products at low prices could exist, but this is false because there is always an actor in the production chain who pays the price.In reality, if you want a responsible product, or one with a social or environmental quality, it necessarily comes at a certain price. While it may be a fair price, some people will think that it’s expensive.Except that we, as consumers, have forgotten what a fair price is, because we have been used to a consumer society where everything was accessible without worrying about these values. Of course this creates frustration now for some people who do not have the means to have access to these kinds of products.Do you think it’s possible to envision second-hand stores one day replacing traditional stores?It’s not at all in the realm of the impossible. I think that if Vinted opened a store in Paris, it would definitely work. What is certain is that the circular economy is becoming more and more widespread, and that things will develop around these concepts.This interview has been translated from French."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",5:30 PM MYT,Tech,JOANNA OSSINGER，ERIC LAM,Bitcoin’s fizzling 2021 returns start to lag mainstream assets,"The returns from Bitcoin this year are sliding below traditional assets as cryptocurrencies struggle to claw back ground lost in a rout in May.The largest token tumbled almost 6% at one point in Asian trading Tuesday and was at a two-week low of about US$33,000 (RM135,980) as of 1:07pm in Hong Kong. The wider Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index fell as much as 10%.Bitcoin is still up 14% this year but that trails commodities as well as some European and Asian share gauges. The proximal cause of Tuesday’s weakness was unclear — one theory was that the recovery of a high-profile Bitcoin ransom by the US showed the token isn’t beyond official control to the extent claimed by its biggest proponents.The fact that investigators ""could trace the untraceable and seize it might be undermining the libertarian, free-of-government-control case,” said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda. The implications of that may have provoked the selling, he said.The US recovered almost all the Bitcoin ransom paid to the perpetrators of the cyber attack on Colonial Pipeline Co. last month in a sign that law enforcement is capable of pursuing online criminals even when they operate outside the nation’s borders.Strategists such as Halley and Evercore ISI’s Rich Ross are watching key technical levels for Bitcoin. Halley said a break below US$30,000 (RM123,615) could lead to ""another capitulation.” Ross sees a test of support around US$29,000 (RM119,494.50)Bitcoin has plunged from a peak of almost $65,000 (RM267,832.50) in mid-April, casting a pall over the cryptocurrency sector. The selloff was exacerbated by billionaire Elon Musk’s public rebuke of the amount of energy used by the servers underpinning the token. Harsh Chinese regulatory oversight also soured the mood.The virtual currency — which has more than tripled over the past year — is now in a ""cooling off period” that could last ""a few months” longer, said Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Luno Pte. – Bloomberg"

Ironically, this also underlines its inherent strength and how quickly it can recover,"" Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight said.""The fact that an outage like this can grab headlines around the world shows how rare it is.""Typical service configurations for a cloud service provider can include updating security rules to protect information, or instructing a server to refresh the contents of a news site before serving it to a customer, said Andy Champagne, senior vice president at Akamai, a cloud service company.A simple typo can be propagated to thousands of servers and cause disruptions, he said.Fastly, which went public in 2019 and has a market capitalization of under $6 billion, is far smaller than peers like Amazon's AWS. The company's content delivery network (CDN) helps websites move content using less-congested routes, enabling them to reach consumers faster.""In the grand scheme of things, we actually think that this is a little bit of a positive for other CDNs and also just shows how difficult managing a CDN can be,"" James Fish, analyst at Piper Sandler & Co, said.Apart from Fastly, the other main CDN providers include Akamai Technologies, Cloudera and AWS.""It certainly reminds us just how crucial so few sites and services are to our digital lives,"" Neil Campling, global TMT analyst at Mirabaud Securities, said.Users received error messages quickly when they visited affected websites on Tuesday, which is an indication Fastly was not a victim of a DDoS attack, or a type of cyber-attack in which a bad actor overwhelms a network with a flood of internet traffic, Champagne said.The United Kingdom's attorney general earlier tweeted that the country's main gov.uk website was down, providing an email for queries.The disruption may have caused issues for citizens booking COVID-19 vaccinations or reporting test results, the Financial Times reported.Websites operated by news outlets including the Financial Times, the Guardian and Bloomberg News also faced outages.News publishers came up with inventive workarounds to report about the outage when their websites failed to load.Popular tech website the Verge used Google Docs to report news, while UK Technology Editor at the Guardian started a Twitter thread to report on the problems.At the onset of the outage, nearly 21,000 Reddit users reported issues with the social media platform, while more than 2,000 users reported problems with Amazon, according to Downdetector.com.Twitter users quickly reacted to the outage, creating the #InternetShutdown hashtag with KITKAT's official handle telling its 441,500 followers ""Guess it's time to Have A Break.""""We were offline for a few minutes because the whole internet broke down,"" tweeted Jitse Groen, chief executive of food delivery group Just Eat Takeaway.com.Shares of New York-listed Fastly were up 4.7% at $52.80, after being down nearly 4% in pre-market trading.(Reporting by Subrat Patnaik, Noor Zainab Hussain, Chavi Mehta and Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru, Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm, and Sheila Dang in Dallas; Editing by Patrick Graham, Bernard Orr and Chris Reese)"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",4:00 PM MYT,Tech,,TikTok shares tips on how to be popular on the video sharing service,"Want to be a star on TikTok? Well you're in luck as the Chinese application has already thought of everything you might need.Secrets, tips and explanations of how it all works... TikTok has unveiled six rules to follow to maximize your chances of getting your big break on the platform. With this little guide, aspiring TikTokers should no longer be intimidated to take the plunge.Whether you are an emerging creator or a young entrepreneur, TikTok can be a valuable tool to help you grow your presence on social. However, the ins and outs of Generation Z's new favorite platform remain a mystery for many internet users who are used to older social networks like Instagram and Twitter.As the Chinese app continues to expand its services in order to attract an increasing number of creators to its platform, it is continuing its pedagogical program by unveiling ""Behind the Camera,"" a two-part series that offers users a look at the keys to succeeding on TikTok, particularly for small-scale sellers.""We are pleased to announce 'Behind The Camera,' a series of easy-to-follow instructional videos showing businesses how to take their TikTok to the next level with the latest creative trends and techniques,"" says the TikTok For Business blog.So if you want to become a Tiktok ""star,"" here are six essential rules to follow to stand out.1. Keep it simple, don't make it complicated!There is no need to complicate things, according to the Chinese platform. A good TikTok post has simplicity at its core in successfully conveying a message and having it understood.Avoid making the mistake of giving too much information at once. If in doubt, scale back the content of your video to one or two pieces of information so as not to lose your followers, even if it means making several TikTok videos in a row to support your point.2. Shoot verticallyOne of TikTok's advantages resides in its full-screen format. To take advantage of this interface, the platform advises users to film vertically and not horizontally in order to offer a better experience to its subscribers. Indeed, it's rare to see horizontally shot TikTok content since the user swipes up and down on the application.3. Get out your ring lightLights! This is one of the most valuable tips when it comes to winning over followers. While a video can last up to 60 seconds, it's within the first few seconds that a user quickly decides whether to move on to another video or to watch yours.Good lighting is an absolute must in order to make your TikTok appealing as possible. Playing with different lighting can also give your video a boost and make its content clear so that the viewer doesn't get bored.4. Focus on the subject!Image quality is very important on the platform. TikTok users pay a lot of attention to the focus of their videos. While this may seem like an obvious tip, it is still very important: make sure you keep the lens focused on the subject, object or thing you want your audience to pay attention to. A blurry video or a subject that gets lost in overly dark lighting due to lack of focus will drive customers away.5. Use effects and text...to boost your chances with the algorithmTikTok loves it when you use its effects and text treatment options on videos. An undeniable advantage since the platform pushes these kinds of videos on the famous ""For You Page."" And TikTok isn't hiding the fact that ""TikTok has created hundreds of effects and text treatment options for you to use in your TikToks. These native features help keep your content feeling native to the platform which can also help get it to more For You pages!""6. Have fun - and post often!It's not surprising that the platform emphasises this aspect. Having fun is essential, and TikTok wants users to remember to focus on positive experiences, although the platform has come under criticism for a lack of moderation.A positive vibe is highly sought after on the Chinese application whose motivational content is often highly watched and liked. That said, a smile is not enough, it's important to publish frequently!Many creators have stressed the importance of posting several times a day in order to attract the attention of the algorithm. And don't forget to interact with your followers, a given for any community platform. – AFP/Relaxnews"

"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,RAZAK AHMAD，DIYANA PFORDTEN,INTERACTIVE: Here’s what vaccinating Malaysian children against Covid-19 could involve,"PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is expected to announce its decision soon on whether children should be included in the country’s Covid-19 immunisation programme.The current plan currently only covers those aged 18 and above, but a growing number of other countries have already started to vaccinate children.The government is currently studying whether Malaysia should follow suit. If the country were to decide to vaccinate its children, what would it involve?According to the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme document, Malaysia currently aims to vaccinate at least 23.6 million people aged 18 and above.Calculations based on the most recent available figures show that vaccinating children aged 12 and above, as several other countries have done, would raise the number vaccinated to at least 26.25 million people.With Malaysia's population currently estimated at 32.77 million according to the Statistic Department's online population clock (www.dosm.gov.my), vaccinating 12- to 17-year-olds could, in theory, help Malaysia meet its aim of covering up to 80% of its population.A population vaccination coverage of 80% is often mentioned by experts as a minimum estimate for a country to achieve herd immunity from Covid-19, though there is no exact figure.“Although no one is certain of the percentage of the population required to be vaccinated before we can hinder the spread of Covid-19 in the community, we do know that this will be difficult without vaccinating children,” senior consultant pediatrician Datuk Dr Amar Singh HSS wrote in an article published by the MySinChew news portal.More than three million children in Malaysia aged between 12 and 17 would get vaccinated if the government decides to include the age group.According to the Children Statistics 2020 report, there were an estimated 2.65 million children who are aged 13-17 as of last year (2020).Those aged 7-12 meanwhile total 3.01 million, according to the report released by the department.Selangor had the biggest number of 13- to 17-year-olds as of last year, with about 475,800 followed by Sabah (374,500), Johor (303,400), Sarawak (246,100) and Perak (202,600).Among the countries which have reportedly begun vaccinating children or have approved jabs for children 12 and above are Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, Britain and the United States."

The United States has tried to stand with Delhi and to bring others, both in the private and public sector, to support them,"" he said.""Our discussions with both our partners in the private sector, and also in government, suggest that we are - knock on wood - still on track for 2022.""""I think we're feeling relatively confident as we head in to 2022,"" he added, while stressing that across Asia and the world even countries that did well in handling the virus were facing outbreaks due to new strains.""I think we understand, the only way to be effective, to counter this, is through vaccine diplomacy. We're trying to step that up more generally,"" he said.The so-called Quad grouping of the United States, India, Japan and Australia agreed at a March summit that Indian drugmaker Biological E Ltd would produce at least a billion vaccine doses by the end of 2022 that would go to Southeast Asian countries, elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, and beyond.U.S. officials said that under the plan the United States and Japan would help Indian manufacturing of vaccines for U.S. drugmakers Novavax Inc and Johnson & Johnson.India, the world's largest vaccine producer, was subsequently hit by a catastrophic wave of infections and halted vaccine exports amid intense criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a domestic vaccine rollout that covered less than 5% of an estimated adult population of 950 million.Indian government sources told Reuters in May India was unlikely to resume major exports of vaccines until at least October. On Tuesday, Indian officials and health experts welcomed a government plan to give free shots to all adults, but cautioned that vaccinations must be accelerated to prevent new surges in infections.(Reporting by David Brunnstrom and Michael Martina in WashingtonEditing by Matthew Lewis)"

She never entered the tent and would just sit close by and watch us work daily.“It became a routine and we would often feed her whatever food we had, such as chicken and rice, as she does not like eating dog food, ” Kpl Faidzul, 33, told The Star.“Her presence was a comfort for us, especially during our roadblock shifts from 4pm to midnight and from midnight to 8am. We would play chase with her and she kept us entertained.”He added that they always wore gloves when interacting with Jony.But things took a turn for the worse when the off-duty Kpl Faidzul received a call from a colleague at midnight on May 29, informing him that a wounded Jony was found in some bushes nearby, presumably injured from an accident.“My colleagues were too afraidto move her. Without a second thought, I called up Hanif Farhan and Syawalludin and we rushed to Jony’s aid.“My heart sank when I saw her in such a fragile state with injuries to her abdomen and legs.“All we could think of was saving our best friend, ” he said, adding that they wrapped her in a blanket and rushed her to the Kota Tinggi government veterinary clinic.“It was closed, so we knocked on the veterinarian’s house door for help. He informed us that government veterinary clinics do not perform surgery.“We ended up taking Jony back to our police quarters and poured some iodine on her wounds, ” he said.The following morning, the three policemen sent the wounded animal to a private veterinary clinic in Taman Kebun Teh.Despite severe spinal injuries, the veterinarian said he could save Jony’s leg but the operation would cost thousands of ringgit.The policemen agreed but faced another issue – a shortage of funds – so Kpl Faidzul reached out to social activist Kuan Chee Heng, better known as Uncle Kentang, for some donations.He said he did not expect Kuan to share their story on his Facebookor for Jony’s story to go viral, but felt touched by his help and the outpour of concern from Malaysians on social media.“Jony underwent her first surgery on June 1, which came up to more than RM2, 000. She is expected to undergo another surgery in about a week’s time as the veterinarian wanted to give her time to recover first.“We are now raising more funds to add to the initial donations in preparation for her second surgery, which is expected to cost more than RM2, 000 as well, ” he said, adding that he was also thankful for the discounts given by the veterinarian.Jony is now recuperating at his friend’s farm in Kota Tinggi, he said, adding that they used some of the donations from Uncle Kentang to build a comfortable cage for her.“I always educate my children to be caring towards animals. My wife has been quite concerned about Jony’s wellbeing too.“We hope Jony can recover and go back to being her bubbly and active self soon, ” Kpl Faidzul said.When contacted, Kuan said he was only trying to highlight the friendship between Jony and the policemen to spread some positive energy during these trying times."

All five of them tested positive, ” she said.On May 22, her parents and younger brother were taken to a quarantine centre but the next day, Siti Raudhah’s mother was transferred to the hospital as her blood oxygen level was low.Her mother had a history of hypertension, diabetes and minor stroke, she said.“Video calls were the only thing connecting my family at the time, ” she added.A few days after her mother’s transfer to the hospital, a doctor asked to see a family member to discuss her condition.“The doctor was honest and said my mother’s chance was 50-50, adding that if there was a younger patient, they would have to choose the younger patient as they would have a better chance of surviving.I tried to be positive and left it all to God.“I was allowed to see my mother after putting on personal protective equipment. She was conscious and could talk but quickly ran out of breath. I managed to recite Surah Yasin for her, comb her hair and help her put on a headscarf.“I apologised for everything and tried not to cry in front of her even though the situation was heart-wrenching, ” Siti Raudhah recalled.On May 28, she said her parents got to speak over the phone and exchanged words of forgiveness.“That morning, my sister also managed to video call our mother but at 7.50am, we received a call from the doctor saying that our mum had passed away in her sleep.”Although Siti Raudhah was devastated by her mother’s passing, it was her father who was most affected as he had lost his life partner of 49 years.“My father was allowed to go home on May 30, two days after my mum died. He was too heartbroken and could not bring himself to enter the house as she was gone forever.“My parents were one of those couples who did everything together, from cooking to gardening.“They also used to wear matching clothes, that was how romantic they were, ” she said.Siti Raudhah said it took a long time to coax her father to enter their house and that she now keeps him company and cooks dishes that her late mother used to prepare.“So for everyone out there, I hope that we are all aware that we must fight Covid-19 together.“Although we all miss gathering with our family, just video call them for now because if your loved one is gone, you won’t be able to look at their face or talk to them anymore, ” she concluded."

The deaths documented by the ministry have been mainly from those with comorbidities, ” said Dr Zulkifli.These comorbidities include malnutrition (as in Indonesia) or obesity, childhood cancers and tumours, children with respiratory illnesses like chronic asthma on steroids, or those with chronic lung disease requiring oxygen, diabetes, complex congenital heart diseases and those who have undergone or are awaiting surgery, and thalassaemia patients on regular transfusions.“Even though children sometimes cannot express themselves and tell anyone if they are unwell, there would be signs of problems like rapid breathing, lethargy, being generally unwell, and persistent crying that would indicate to us that the child is more unwell than we think.“The treatment protocol for children in categories 4 and 5 is similar to adults. They will require oxygen or ventilation if they deteriorate, ” said Dr Zulkifli.He added that before embarking on the mass vaccination of children, it would be better to complete the vaccination of adults first as they are the ones who bring the virus home.“In order for children to be vaccinated, the vaccines have to show no long-term effects, especially with the risk of auto-immune diseases.“We know that children below 18 years of age make up 32% of our population, so eventually the age will have to be lowered – but not before definite results of long-term safety, ” said Dr Zulkifli.He advised parents to teach their children to be aware of their surroundings, practise physical distancing, avoid crowds, wash their hands frequently and wear masks.“Many children are sent to nurseries or childcare centres where they will bring back infections. So, parents have to ensure the carers have all been vaccinated and practise good hygiene. The same for kindergartens and schools.“Our priority should be to protect our children so all staff in these schools, kindergartens and daycare centres must show proof they have been vaccinated, ” said Dr Zulkifli."
"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",,News,ZAKIAH KOYA，JO TIMBUONG，CLARISSA CHUNG,Other nations include children for vaccination,"PETALING JAYA: Countries are looking at strategies to curb Covid-19 infections among children, with some even approving vaccines for adolescents.Much of the focus during the pandemic has been on elderly folk and those with comorbidities.However, as cases surge in the global community, the number of Covid-19 infections has also risen among those under the age of 18.In Brazil, deaths among children under the age of 10 were reportedly over 2, 000, according to data as of mid-April.More than 60, 000 children in the age group have been hospitalised for Covid-19 in the country, with many facing severe symptoms such as muscle aches, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.In July last year, Indonesia was said to be set to have the world’s highest rate of child deaths from Covid-19.At that time, the Indonesian Paediatric Society said it believed more than 300 children in Indonesia had died from the disease.Now, as vaccination rates gain traction across the world, children and adolescents are slowly being included for such vaccination.The United Kingdom has recently approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds, while children of that same age bracket have already been receiving the shot in the United States.The Chinese government has also approved Sinovac jabs to be given to those aged between three and 17.Closer to home, Singapore has also approved the Pfizer vaccine for children aged between 12 and 15.Health experts in Malaysia have been urging the public to adhere to the rules and get vaccinated.International Islamic University of Malaysia public health specialist Asst Prof Dr Mohammad Farhan Rusli said the increase in infections among children was a cause for concern.“It is worrying. It is extremely important for those who can receive the vaccines to take them. Only through herd immunity, we can protect these vulnerable children from getting infected, ” he said.He advised parents to keep their children at home, to minimise contact with others, especially in crowded places.“They should also emphasise good hygiene practices, such as the 3Ws (Wash hands, Wear masks, Warn about Covid-19) as well as avoid 3Cs (Crowded places, Confined spaces, Close conversations), ” he said.Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming, of Universiti Malaya’s Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, also pointed out children may risk infecting others.“Although the symptoms and mortality rate of Covid-19 among children is very low compared with adults, they still can be the source of infection to older people and high-risk groups.“On the other hand, children with pre-existing medical conditions will be at risk of severe disease and intensive care admission, ” she said.She said while children need to be protected against Covid-19, vaccination should be prioritised among older persons and high-risk groups while the country’s vaccines are in short supply.“If all the adults are vaccinated, we may have achieved 60-70% coverage, which from US and UK experiences, the transmission rate would reduce substantially, as well as rates of hospitalisation and death.“If there is supply, children above 12 years old should be vaccinated like in the US, UK and Singapore, ” she said.She said onsite schooling should be delayed until infection rates are reduced and parents should abide by the standard operating procedure when they are in public places.“If parents think they are at risk of getting infected while they work, they should maintain physical distancing with the children, and refrain from sharing food or eating together with the children, ” she said.However, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Azmi Mohd Tamil said it must be determined if the increase of cases among children is disproportionately high compared to earlier trends.“We must first verify if it is an apparent rise or real rise in cases among children. This is because the total number of new cases has risen. We need to know the proportion of children getting infected, ” he said.He added that schools had now been closed, and there is a rule that children below the age of 12 must stay at home except for specific reasons.“Steps have been taken, but the ultimate responsibility lies with oneself to comply with the rules, ” he said."

We hope neither we nor our kids get infected by the disease,” said the 30-year-old from Kota Baru.Recalling her stay, Sharifah said she spent about 13 days in hospital with her businessman husband Mohd Azlee Che Mohd Zaid and their son, Mir Ali Zafar, who was three months old at the time.While she was well cared for by medical workers there, the housewife said she was mentally exhausted thinking about her two other children, who tested negative and placed in their grandmother’s care.“Nowadays, I get a little anxious if I feel unwell, worrying if I contracted Covid-19 again.“Thankfully, we are all healthy. We understand that we must stay at home to guard against getting infected,” she said.Recently, Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said there was a rise in infections among younger children, some of whom had to be treated at intensive care units.Sharifah said she and her husband tried to set good examples for their three children, now aged six, four and one-and-a-half, and remind them to wash their hands and wear their face masks properly.She said her children understood that they could not go for outings because of the pandemic.“We are grateful that they are obedient and follow our advice.“There are times when they get upset and sulk, as children sometimes do, but they listen,” Sharifah said.Kiranjit Muniandy wonders if she is doing enough to protect her 19-month-old daughter from getting infected.“The number of kids getting infected of late is alarming. It’s tougher now because she is at that age where she just wants to touch everything,” she said.Kiranjit, 39, was also worried about the high number of new cases daily.“My husband and I have decided not to go out and stay at home.“We have also stopped receiving visitors. We take care of our daughter while we work from home.“Thankfully, we work on shifts. My husband works in the day while I work at night so we take turns,” said the banking executive.Kiranjit said she would take every precaution to protect her family from being infected and hoped that the pandemic would end soon as she misses her family in Sabah.“My daughter has not met her grandparents for over a year,” she said."

Their 9-year-old son, Fayez Afzaal, remained hospitalized on Tuesday with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.A 20-year-old suspect named Nathaniel Veltman is in police custody, charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.In a statement issued late on Monday, relatives of the victims disputed an initial police appraisal that the accused man was not a member of any hate group and had no accomplices.""The young man who committed this act of terror was influenced by a group that he associated with, and the rest of the community must take a strong stand against this,"" the relatives said in a statement, though they did not identify the group or explain how they know about the alleged ties.""We need to stand against hate and Islamophobia and raise awareness in our communities and across all the political spectrum,"" they added.Police, citing witnesses, said Veltman jumped the curb in his vehicle and struck five members of the family. Veltman, with no previous criminal record, is due back in court on Thursday after being remanded to custody on Monday.The relatives of the victims said the children had both been top students and their parents excelled in their fields.""Everyone who knew Salman and the rest of the ... family know the model family they were as Muslims, Canadians and Pakistanis.

They moved to Canada from Pakistan in 2007, according to local media reports.""We've seen the kids grow up,"" Yasir said.Yasir noted that the women were wearing hijabs and traditional shalwar kameez - a pair of loose, pleated trousers worn with a long shirt by many women from South Asia.""They were visible,"" Yasir said. ""It could have been me.""The GoFundMe page described Afzaal, a physiotherapist, as a cricket enthusiast with a warm smile and Salman as a scholar working hard to obtain her PhD in civil engineering from the University of Western Ontario.As of Tuesday morning the page had raised just shy of C$270,000 ($223,454 in U.S. dollars).On Tuesday morning, Fayez Afzaal was alert in the hospital and in stable condition, Yasir said.The local school board said Yumna Afzaal, a ninth-grade student, would be ""deeply missed,"" adding that flags would be flown at half-staff for the week and a trauma-response team would be available at area schools.The attack was the worst against Canadian Muslims since a man gunned down six members of a Quebec City mosque in 2017.""After Quebec it was: are we safe praying in our mosques? And now it's: are we safe going out for a walk after dinner?"" said Nawaz Tahrir, a spokesperson for the London Muslim Mosque, where Afzaal was a familiar figure.Tahrir added that Canadians have to ""ask more of our leaders"" and enact policies that address the causes of anti-Muslim hate.""Until we do that, I fear that this isn't going to be the last incident,"" Tahrir said.($1 = 1.2083 Canadian dollars)(Reporting by Moira Warburton in Vancouver and Anna Mehler Paperny in Toronto;Editing by Denny Thomas, Will Dunham and Raissa Kasolowsky)"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",9:10 PM MYT,News,SUDIP KAR-GUPTA，MICHEL ROSE,Macron slapped in the face during walkabout in southern France,"PARIS (Reuters) -A man slapped President Emmanuel Macron in the face on Tuesday during a walkabout in southern France.Macron later said he had not feared for his safety, and that nothing would stop him carrying on with his job.In a video circulating on social media, Macron reached out his hand to greet a man in a small crowd of onlookers standing behind a metal barrier as he visited a professional training college for the hospitality industry.The man, who was dressed in a khaki T-shirt, then shouted ""Down with Macronia"" (""A Bas La Macronie"") and slapped Macron on the left side of his face.He could also be heard shouting ""Montjoie Saint Denis"", the battle cry of the French army when the country was still a monarchy.Two of Macron's security detail tackled the man in the T-shirt, and another ushered Macron away. Another video posted on Twitter showed that the president, a few seconds later, returned to the line of onlookers and resumed shaking hands.The local mayor, Xavier Angeli, told franceinfo radio that Macron urged his security to ""leave him, leave him"" as the offender was being held to the ground.Two people were arrested, a police source told Reuters. The identify of the man who slapped Macron, and his motives, were unclear.The slogan the man shouted has been co-opted in the past few years by royalists and people on the far-right in France, Fiametta Venner, a political scientist who studies French extremists, told broadcaster BFMTV.Macron was on a visit to the Drome region to meet restaurateurs and students and talk about returning to a normal life after the COVID-19 pandemic.It was one of a series of visits he is making, his aides say, to take the nation's pulse before a presidential election next year. He later continued his visit to the region.SECURITY DETAILMacron, a former investment banker, is accused by his opponents of being a part of a moneyed elite aloof from the concerns of ordinary citizens.In part to counter those allegations, he on occasion seeks out close contact with voters in impromptu situations, but this can throw up challenges for his security detail.Footage at the start of Tuesday's slapping incident showed Macron jogging over to the barrier where the onlookers were waiting, leaving his security detail struggling to keep up. When the slap happened, two of the security detail were at his side, but two others had only just caught up.In an interview with the Dauphine Libere newspaper after the attack, Macron said: ""You cannot have violence, or hate, either in speech or actions. Otherwise, it's democracy itself that is threatened.""""Let us not allow isolated events, ultraviolent individuals... to take over the public debate: they don't deserve it.""Macron said he had not feared for his safety, and had continued shaking hands with members of the public after he was struck. ""I kept going, and I will keep going. Nothing will stop me,"" he said.In 2016, Macron, who was economy minister at the time, was pelted with eggs by hard-left trade unionists during a strike against labour reforms. Macron described that incident as ""par for the course"" and said it would not curb his determination.Two years later, anti-government ""yellow vest"" protesters heckled and booed Macron in an incident that government allies said left the president shaken.(Reporting by Dominique Vidalon, Michel Rose, Sudip Kar-Gupta; Writing by Christian Lowe and Richard Lough; Editing by)"

I served in the navy for 12 years and was the first female commanding officer, ” she said.She also said there have been ""procedural errors"" on the part of the investigating officers, alleging that she was arrested without a warrant.Phoon also asked that she be offered bail at $3,000 without a surety, as she was the navy's first female commanding officer and has made contributions to Singapore ""as a pioneer"".The prosecution had asked for bail to be set at $10,000, with the conditions that she complies with current Covid-19 regulations and does not reoffend while out on bail.The court was told that Phoon may face further charges.Phoon told the court her family members in Singapore were either ill or elderly and that most of her friends were overseas.She also asked for clarification on what the Covid-19 regulations were.District Judge Janet Wang said these were laws everyone else was abiding by, including the wearing of a mask in public spaces.Phoon was previously on trial for a charge under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act: for failing to wear a mask over her nose and mouth “at all times” at Newton Hawker Centre, between 7.20pm and 8pm on May 8,2020.She had turned up for a hearing on that charge on May 24 and was seen removing her mask after leaving the State Courts building that day.She was arrested the next day and slapped with five more charges under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act and one charge under the Infectious Diseases Act.One of the charges relates to an incident on May 15, when Phoon was caught on video refusing to wear a mask at MBS after been told to do so by a safe distancing ambassador.She was seen questioning the safe distancing ambassador whether she had a badge and asking who she represented.The charge under the Infectious Diseases Act is for loitering at various places in MBS while under a Stay Home Notice in June last year.She had been remanded for two weeks at IMH after the charges were tendered against her.The court was told on Tuesday that the report from IMH has been completed, but no details of the report’s contents were revealed in open court.The case has been adjourned for further mention on June 15 for additional charges to be tendered.First-time offenders who breach laws under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000.Repeat offenders can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000. - The Straits Times/Asia News Network"
"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",,Business,ROYCE TAN,Q1 high for EPF,"PETALING JAYA: The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has posted its highest quarterly gross investment income of RM19.29bil for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021 amid the uncertainties from the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.It was a 58.63% jump year-on-year (y-o-y) from RM12.16bil last year and a 17.84% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) increase as compared to RM16.37bil for the three-month period ended Dec 31, 2020.The latest quarterly gross investment income alone surpassed the full year performance of 2009 and its preceding years.The stellar performance came mainly from equities, which accounted for RM14.28bil or 74% of the gross investment income while fixed income instruments contributed a stable income of RM3.92bil.Income from real estate and infrastructure, as well as money market instruments, came in at RM710mil and RM380mil respectively.After the cost write-down on listed equities, which is a prudent measure practiced by the EPF to ensure that its long-term investment portfolio remains healthy, the fund recorded a net investment income of RM19.24bil.EPF chief executive officer Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan (file pic above) said the fund’s solid performance for the first quarter was a spillover from the global economic recovery that began in the second-half of last year.“We believe that the vaccination rollouts as well as supportive fiscal and monetary policies worldwide will play a key role in facilitating economic activities and growth.“The inflationary concerns did not derail the positive trend in the equity markets and we took advantage of the opportunity to reposition our holdings in stocks that are fundamentally strong but undervalued, ” he said in a statement.Amir added that while the EPF remains cautious for the coming quarter given the downside risks of the new highly transmissible Covid-19 variants, he assured members that the EPF continuously take the necessary measures to protect members’ savings, supported by its strong governance framework as it strives to meet the mandate and strategic targets of providing members with a sustainable retirement.“Our disciplined investment approach and robust liquidity management guided by the Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) has been successful in minimising the impact of the substantial disbursements on the EPF’s portfolio, allowing it to sustain a steady performance in these trying times.“This reflects the fund’s commitment to safeguarding our members’ retirement savings by preserving and enhancing the value of those savings, while ensuring that their short-term needs are met without compromising their long-term interests, ” he said.EPF’s investment assets stood at RM981.71bil as at end March 2021, of which 36% was invested overseas.The diversification in different asset classes, markets, and currencies continued to provide income stability and added value to the fund’s overall returns.During the first quarter, the EPF’s overseas investments generated an income of RM11.15bil, or 58% of the total gross investment income recorded, mainly driven by foreign equities.By asset class, fixed income instruments made up 46% of investments while equities comprised 44%.Money market instruments and real estate and infrastructure made up 4% and 6% respectively of investments.EPF said the portfolio reflected its diversification strategy to optimise returns within tolerable risk limits as guided by the SAA, which has proven to be resilient in the face of any challenging market environment, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.To date, a total of RM57.97bil of i-Sinar withdrawals have been approved for 6.49 million applicants, out of which RM50.93bil have been disbursed, while RM20.80bil has been paid out to 5.27 million members under the i-Lestari facility.EPF’s i-Sinar and iLestari facilities were introduced last year to allow affected members to make withdrawals that would help provide some measure of financial relief.Riding on the expectations of a global recovery this year, Socio-Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie told StarBiz that 2021 would be a better year from a macro perspective in terms of sustainable global recovery and global equity markets’ performance.“Countries like the United States are showing steady signs of recovery from the pandemic and that will help to support the global equity markets.“It is indeed a very good start in 2021 for the EPF with the jump in gross investment income that largely came from equities, about half from overseas investments.“Hopefully, this set of numbers registered in the first quarter can be sustained throughout the year, underpinned by the income from EPF’s foreign equity portion, ” he said, adding that this would also have a positive spillover of the domestic equity market.Despite the periodic volatilities on the back of concerns of the rising Covid-19 cases in recent weeks that led to a lockdown, Lee said the benchmark index FBM KLCI is still holding on.While these may tamper the macro outlook and some recovery play stocks, he noted that there would not be any significant impact on the overall domestic equity market.“It is still very much dependent on the overseas performance, particularly the Dow Jones, ” he said."

Currently operating in 75 so-called availability zones in 24 regions, the firm has also launched a third data centre in Indonesia. — BloombergIt was the No. 3 Infrastructure-as-a-Service, or IaaS cloud provider globally in 2020, behind Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, according to industry researcher Gartner.“Our strategic roadmap for Apac includes targeted investments to facilitate the digital transformation of local businesses, ” Selina Yuan, general manager of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence’s international business unit, said in the statement. “We see these investments as all the more timely given the impact of the pandemic and the sharp rise in demand for digital business tools.”Fierce rival Tencent said last week it’s launching four data centres in Bangkok, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Tokyo, giving its cloud business a presence in 27 regions worldwide. -- Bloomberg"

That would make the upstart bank worth just slightly less than Banco Santander Brasil SA, Brazil's No. 3 bank, which has more than 2, 000 branches.The transaction also vaults Nubank into the upper echelons of fintechs worldwide, on a par with brokerage startup Robinhood Markets Inc and China's Lufax but still far behind Ant Group.Nubank, which has 40 million clients, said in a statement it plans to use the proceeds to fund its international expansion to Mexico and Colombia, launch new products and services and hire more employees.The arrival of such high-profile investors, who usually invest in publicly traded companies, gives a hint on how close Nubank is to a listing.Earlier in April, Reuters reported that Nubank had initiated preparations for a U.S. stock market listing which could come as early as this year, according to sources familiar with the matter.BERKSHIRE BETS IN BRAZILNubank is Warren Buffett's second bet on a Brazilian financial startup.

KLK has been on an active acquisition mode over the past few years.Last year, KLK’s indirect unit Taiko Plantations Pte Ltd (TPPL) acquired TSH Resources Bhd’s 90% stakes in its subsidiaries in Indonesia for US$109.23mil (RM450mil).The transaction saw TSH Resources realising cash proceeds of RM517.62mil that went toward paring down its debt.KLK had, in 2018, also acquired a 95% stake in an Indonesian oil palm company, PT Putra Bongan Jaya which has plantations in East Kalimantan for about RM300mil.Yesterday, the third benchmark CPO futures contract for August closed RM88 lower to RM4, 049 per tonne.Early last month, the CPO price have risen to a historical high of almost RM4, 700 per tonne as the markets priced-in and were looking forward to an economic recovery post-Covid 19."

Why do you have a customs authority that is completely unintegrated with the Inland Revenue authority?“The other challenge is the progressiveness of the taxation system. We need a far more comprehensive, equitable and progressive view in reforming the system, ” he said.Jomo (pic below) pointed out that there is a possibility for the government to generate additional revenue by imposing windfall and other capital gains taxes, although he said the tax proceeds “won’t be very much”.Meanwhile, Mohd Afzanizam said the Covid-19 pandemic had accentuated the level of inequality in society, making it more difficult for the government to prescribe a new taxation system.“Nevertheless, this crisis has opened up opportunities for the policy makers to rethink what are the best means to not just raise revenues, but also to redistribute wealth between the rich and the poor.“Obviously, taxation is one of the mechanisms but the philanthropy economy such as donations or in the case of Islamic economy, waqf (endowment), is something that we need to look at more seriously at the moment, ” said Mohd Afzanizam."

Millions of unemployed Americans remain at home because of trouble securing child care, generous unemployment benefits and lingering fears over COVID-19 even as vaccines are widely accessible and the pandemic is subsiding.""The evidence continues to grow that the lackluster job creation of recent months is a result of constraints on labor supply and that the labor market is tight,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 998, 000 to 9.3 million on the last day of April, the highest level since the series began in December 2000. Vacancies rose in all four regions and were spread across nearly all industries as well as the government sector.Unfilled jobs in the accommodation and food services increased by 349, 000. There were an additional 115, 000 job openings in other services, while vacancies at manufacturers of long-lasting goods increased 78, 000. But job openings decreased in educational services and mining and logging industry.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 8.3 million in April. The job openings rate shot up to an all-time high of 6.0% from 5.4% in March.Hiring inched up to 6.1 million in April from 6.0 million in the prior month. The government reported last Friday that job growth picked up in May, with employers raising wages, but the pace of hiring was below economists' expectations for a second straight month.Companies are struggling to find workers even as about 9.3 million people are officially unemployed. Economists expect the labor market disconnect will be resolved in the fall. Government-funded unemployment benefits will end in early September. Republican governors in 25 states, accounting for more than 40% of the workforce, are ending federal government unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly subsidy, starting on Saturday.Schools are set to fully reopen in the fall and more people are expected to be vaccinated against COVID-19. At least half of the adult American population is fully inoculated.The JOLTS report also showed 384, 000 people voluntarily quit their jobs in April, lifting the total to a record 4.0 million. About 106, 000 retail workers left their jobs, while professional and business services saw 94, 000 resignations.In the transportation, warehousing and utilities industry, 49, 000 workers quit. The number of quits rose in the South, Midwest and West regions. The quits rate increased to an all-time high of 2.7% from 2.5% in March.The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. But nearly 1.8 million women have left the labor force since February 2020 mostly because of problems related to child care.With willing workers scarce, layoffs and discharges dropped by 81, 000 to a record low 1.4 million. There was a 0.95 open job per unemployed person in April. Rising job openings and voluntary quits could pressure employers to raise wages.Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.TRADE GAP NARROWSA separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the reopening economy was leading to a shift in domestic demand back to services from goods, with the trade deficit retreating from a record high in April as imports fell.The trade deficit dropped 8.2% to $68.9 billion in April. The gap widened to a record $75.0 billion in March. Economists had forecast a $69.0 billion trade deficit.Goods imports dropped 1.9% to $232.0 billion. The decline was led by a $2.6 billion drop in imports of consumer goods, which reflected decreases in textile apparel, toys, games and sporting goods as well as household appliances. Imports of motor vehicles, parts and engines also fell.But imports of cell phones and other household goods increased. Imports of foods, feeds and beverages were the highest on record as were of those of capital goods. Imports of services increased $0.7 billion to $41.9 billion in April. They were lifted by travel and transport services.""With the pandemic coming under control, consumers are redirecting their spending towards domestically produced services and away from imports,"" said Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Exports of goods gained 1.1% to a record $145.3 billion, boosted shipments of civilian aircraft. Exports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest on record, with crude oil shipments rising $1.0 billion. But exports of motor vehicles, parts and engines fell. Auto production has been hit by a global semiconductor shortage.Exports of foods, feeds and beverages were the highest on record. Exports of services increased $0.7 billion amid small gains in travel, transport and charges for the use of intellectual property.At $17.8 billion in April, the services surplus was the smallest since August 2012. Exports are likely to continue rising as global economic growth gains momentum.When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $7.2 billion to $98.6 billion in April.Trade was a drag on gross domestic product growth in the first quarter. Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, after the economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate in the third quarter.- Reuters"

"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",,Sport,,As good as it gets – Euro 2000 the gold standard,"RARE is the tournament where the quality of the football is of the highest order, and the drama surpasses all expectations.Euro 2000, co-hosted by Belgium and Holland, was one such spectacle.So good it was, that many pundits hailed it as the best Finals ever staged.For the romantics who couldn’t help waxing lyrical about it, it was the “Renaissance of football”.France landed the top prize, but there was a feeling from the first match that the tournament was going to prove special for many reasons.As attacking philosophies largely came to the fore in a flurry of goals and entertainment, the competition boasted 2.74 goals per match – the most per game in a tournament (since 1980).Although some ugly scenes of violence managed to cast a shadow on the competition – and England’s participation – at one stage, the game emerged as the true winner.LIVING UP TO THE HYPEFrance’s squad were stronger and more experienced all-round than their World Cup-winning side in 1998.Coach Roger Lemerre inherited a side from Aime Jacquet built around Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly, Didier Deschamps and the excellence of a peaking Zinedine Zidane.But while Jacquet succeeded without a world class striker, Lemerre had three – Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet and Nicolas Anelka – to choose from!While the French were applauded for their attacking intent, their flair was matched by co-hosts Holland.The dazzling Dutch, under Frank Rijkaard, and their fervent supporters lit up the event, and they were the only side to beat France in their last group match.Yugoslavia also provided a feast of attacking football, but paid dearly for their defensive frailty which was ruthlessly exposed by Holland in a blistering six-goal display in the quarter-finals.There were, of course, poor teams but very few poor games.Sadly, England and Germany were two of the worst on show.The Three Lions, led by Kevin Keegan, registered a rare win over the Germans in a dour encounter and both sides deservedly failed to make it beyond the group stage.An entertaining Portugal outclassed both the traditional giants, en route to a thrilling semi-final exit at the hands of the French.ITALIAN ANTI-FOOTBALLIf there were a team that everyone loved to hate at this party of attractive football, it had to be Dino Zoff’s methodical and pragmatic Italy.The defensive kings won few fans as they halted Holland’s relentless journey to the final.With a seemingly impregnable backline featuring masters Paolo Maldini and Fabio Cannavaro, the Azzurri successfully repelled the potent attack of the Dutch – boasting Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Kluivert – with 10 men till after extra time following the dismissal of Gianluca Zambrotta after just 34 minutes in the semi-final which ended 0-0.Rijkaard’s hapless men even missed two penalties in regulation time! After the Italians prevailed 3-1 in the shootout, Zoff’s uncompromising hard men found some defenders in the form of the commentators.One highlighted it would be wrong to vilify the Italians, whose ‘defensive organisation demonstrated a different kind of admirable beauty and heroism’.PRAGMATISM vs FLAIRThe purists were on the brink of heartbreak in the final.With 90 minutes played, Italy looked set for glory thanks to Marco Delvecchio’s 55th-minute strike.But in the breathless five minutes of stoppage time that followed, the French musketeers would not be denied – substitute Sylvain Wiltord struck in the 93rd minute to send the game into extra-time.In the conclusion that was pure drama, Trezeguet rifled in a golden goal to ensure France’s place in football history.An ecstatic Deschamps said: “It’s never going to get any better than this!”He could have been talking about the whole tournament."

I've been playing better and better and now we'll see what happens next,"" he said.Having been knocked out in the quarter-finals twice before, by Dominic Thiem and Novak Djokovic, Zverev stood a better chance against the lower-ranked Fokina.The Spaniard signalled his intentions by breaking in the first game, moving his opponent around and mixing it with drop shots.Zverev broke straight back but looked out of sorts when the chair umpire corrected a line call, denying him another break.However, Fokina struggled with his service games as Zverev's confidence grew.Zverev hit winner after winner, while his 21-year-old opponent failed to keep the ball on court, and raced to a routine win as he claimed his 15th consecutive set in Paris.(Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and Ken Ferris)"

Their hopes will depend to a large extent on the fitness and form of Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard, but they will need Lukaku to put the ball in the net.Having made his senior debut aged 16 for Anderlecht, it feels like Lukaku has been around forever. Now 28, he is in the form of his life, fresh from scoring 30 goals in all competitions for Inter Milan, including 24 in their run to the Serie A title. He is Belgium’s record goal-scorer with 60 in 93 appearances for his country, including four at the 2018 World Cup and seven in just five appearances in Euro qualifying.Cristiano RonaldoRonaldo is 36 now, so this could be his penultimate appearance at a major international tournament. His role in Portugal’s Euro 2016 triumph was actually limited -- he scored just three goals, albeit including the opener in the semi-final against Wales, and he came off injured in the first half of the final against France.Ronaldo’s importance to Portugal may not be what it once was either given the wealth of talent spread throughout their team. However, he is still coming off a season in which he scored 36 goals for Juventus, and the Portugal skipper is now eyeing the all-time international scoring record of 109 held by Iran’s Ali Daei -- Ronaldo is currently just six shy of that figure.Harry KaneKane’s build-up to the Euro has been overshadowed by the uncertainty surrounding his future at club level after he indicated last month that it might be time for him to leave Tottenham Hotspur. However, the 27-year-old England captain will need to put that to the back of his mind to focus on Euro 2020 as he prepares to lead Gareth Southgate’s attack.The top scorer at the 2018 World Cup with six goals, Kane went on to score 12 times in Euro qualifying and was the top scorer in the Premier League in the season just finished with 23 goals, despite playing in an underperforming Spurs team.Given the quality of players around him creating the chances, it could be another prolific summer for Kane.Robert LewandowskiAt 32, Lewandowski is at the peak of his powers, fresh from breaking Gerd Mueller’s long-standing record for the most goals in a Bundesliga season as he netted 41 times in 29 appearances for Bayern Munich.Had the Ballon d’Or been awarded last year, Lewandowski would have been a worthy winner. His chances of winning it this year probably depend on how he performs at the Euro for Poland, and Lewandowski has not done well at recent major tournaments -- he netted just once at Euro 2016 and not at all as his country limped out of the last World Cup in the group stage.Gerard MorenoSpain do not boast the star-studded squad of years past but there is no shortage of talent at Luis Enrique’s disposal and the man to look out for in attack is Moreno, the 29-year-old fresh from scoring 23 goals in La Liga, a tally bettered only by Lionel Messi.The former Espanyol marksman also netted seven times in the Europa League and scored in the penalty shoot-out in the final as Villarreal beat Manchester United. A late bloomer, Moreno only made his debut for Spain in the qualifying campaign for the Euro under former coach Robert Moreno.Karim BenzemaThe return of Benzema to the France squad was sensational news, the Real Madrid striker ending five and a half years in the international wilderness. He had not played for his country since a blackmail scandal over a sextape involving his former teammate Mathieu Valbuena broke in 2015.His hopes of a recall seemed to recede in January, when French prosecutors said they had decided to send Benzema and four others for trial. However, coach Didier Deschamps could no longer ignore Benzema’s form after a season in which he scored 30 goals for his club. His addition further strengthens an already fearsome France side. — AFP"

"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",,Metro,FARID WAHAB,Local authorities urged to reopen public parks,"LOCAL authorities in Klang Valley have been urged to review their decision to close public parks during the lockdown period.Social activist Tan Sri Lee Lam Thye said it was important to allow people, especially those living in low-cost flats, to have a suitable space for physical exercises.Lee, who is committee chairman of Taman Pudu Ulu, a public park under Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL), said prolonged isolation at home with family members was bound to create tension, which could lead to deterioration of mental health.“People need some space to release pent-up energy.“They will be bored if they are cooped up at home for too long.“What if the lockdown is extended? The relevant authorities must come up with a solution to this matter, ” he said.DBKL announced on May 31 that it would close all public parks under its jurisdiction from June 1 to 14 in light of the lockdown announced by the government.On the same day, National Landscape Department announced on its official Facebook page that it would close Taman Persekutuan Bukit Kiara in Taman Tun Dr Ismail without giving an exact reopening date.Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) followed suit the next day, announcing that all its public playgrounds, parks and hiking trails would be off-limits to the public.Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob had announced that sports and recreational activities would be limited to jogging and non-contact exercises during the lockdown.These activities can take place in a neighbourhood from 7am to 8pm, subject to the usual standard operating procedure.Lee said although people were allowed to exercise in their neighbourhood, this presented some health and safety concerns.“Safety risk increases because of traffic on roads and they are also exposed to exhaust fumes, which is unhealthy, ” he said.He noted that local authorities could consider opening parks if they ensured proper precautions were taken.“The types of activities that are permitted should be limited to jogging and brisk walking with no group activities.“Enforcement officers should be stationed to monitor compliance and ensure physical distancing, ” said Lee, adding that they should issue fines if SOP was not followed."
"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",,Metro,CY LEE,Banking on generous Malaysians,"SINCE the Covid-19 pandemic started, Malaysians have come forward and shown their generous side.Individuals and business entities are getting together to offer help to the less fortunate and those who have lost their jobs or whose income is badly hit when business dropped.Many cannot afford to put food on the table due to these unforeseen events.Kind-hearted individuals and organisations have come to their aid by offering them rice, flour, eggs and sugar among other essential foodstuff, through food banks set up in various places in Klang Valley.StarMetro spoke to three individuals on how their establishments have provided food for those in need.Contactless food bankkEATchen, a food and beverage business based in Ara Damansara, Petaling Jaya is a cloud kitchen that started just a few weeks ago.(Cloud kitchen is a business that prepares food for sale specifically for delivery).Most people new to the business would not think of starting an initiative that provided food for the needy, but this was not the case with kEATchen.Its chief operating officer Ivan Chan said the business became a charity overnight, although it was still very much an F&B business.“The food bank idea came to me on May 30 after a childhood friend asked for some money to buy milk powder for his baby.“He has been out of a job since the first movement control order and has not been able to find a job for over a year, ” he said.Chan said that it was then that he realised how badly some people were affected by the pandemic, even if they were not in the B40 category, and he decided to use part of his business premises as a temporary food bank.“I shared a post on social media to let people know what I wanted to do and before I knew it, people started sharing it in their chat groups.“Since then, we have been giving out more than two tonnes of foodstuff every day with each bag comprising at least 1.5kg of rice, 1.5kg potatoes, 1kg cooking oil, 1kg sugar and 15 eggs, which should last three to four days for a family of four.”Helping him distribute the items are volunteers, including employees and family members of kEATchen’s management.According to Chan, many of the recipients are the hardcore poor living in people’s housing projects and low-cost flats who have to travel almost 10km to reach the temporary food bank.“Seeing some people coming by in cars shows that even the middle-income group is financially stressed now, ” he said.He added that kEATchen also distributed food items to the Taxi Drivers Welfare Association and people living in Kepong and Puchong.“At times we have kind donors who send in extra items like biscuits, noodles and flour. We add them into each bag, ” said Chan.Another item sometimes included, he said, was baby formula.He said it came to a point where there were long queues and overcrowding, so a new plan had to be implemented to distribute the items.They follow the standard operating procedure strictly and regularly disinfect the collection area.His team also monitors those who collect the foodstuff, via photographs and their MySejahtera check-in history which they impose as a pre-condition.Chan said the food supplies were placed in pigeonholes made specially for food collection without having contact with anyone.To help disperse the crowd, he reached out to Petaling Jaya MP Maria Chin Abdullah to set up additional collection points.“We hand over 220 bags or about 1.5 tonnes of foodstuff each day to her office for distribution in Lembah Subang and Desa Mentari.“We ourselves take care of those from other areas, which come to about 500 complete sets a day.”So far, Chan has spent RM10, 000 of his own money.His family and friends have helped out and he plans to continue the effort as long as the MCO is in force.Community food boxShell Setia Alam retailer Suraya Saruwan started offering provisions in a food box at her petrol station a year ago.It was the first of its kind at any petrol station.The concept became a model for over 50 other stations and an inspiration for other businesses that replicated it to help those who were affected financially.In the early stages, after non-governmental organisation Volunteer’s Unite approached her station to start a food bank, Suraya engaged with residents in the community to help sustain the initiative.“Nowadays, I rarely need to replenish the items from my own supply.“In fact, when we have a surplus of food, we send them to the elderly and the disabled as well as to welfare homes nearby, ” she said.She highlighted that they also delivered to those who did not have transport to get to the petrol station.This, she said, was made possible by engaging with the management of apartments who identify suitable recipients.Suraya said other petrol stations were doing the same but focused on welfare homes.“At this station, we limit each person taking the food to three items but we give the elderly more basic necessities so they won’t need to come out so much during the pandemic.”She said many at the Akasia and Semarak apartments lived alone or without their children.Now, the food box collection at Shell petrol stations also accept and distribute non-perishable goods as well as personal care items such as soap, diapers and toiletries.“We also receive non-food items from donors, including baby diapers.“Someone even left a baby car seat by our food box that was in good condition. It quickly found a new owner who had recently given birth.”According to Suraya, more people are showing up to pick up things from the food box since the latest MCO which started on June 1.“It is not surprising because many people have had to take a pay cut, ” she noted.Volunteers Unite founder Alfred Samuel Mariyaras said the food boxes around Shah Alam, Klang, Subang Jaya and Petaling Jaya were actively being utilised and were normally able to meet the needs of the beneficiaries.Alfred, who helps top up community food boxes with products sourced from corporations or other non-governmental organisations such as Kembara Kitchen, said it was heartening to see support from them.“It is also good to see the number of food boxes growing, not just among the Shell petrol stations, ” he added.Aside from providing humanitarian aid to disaster-stricken areas when necessary, Volunteers Unite is currently focusing on providing food aid to the needy throughout the pandemic, including welfare homes.Food projectOn a normal day before the pandemic, The Lost Food Project (TLFP) enlisted the help of over 100 volunteers to save food from ending up in landfills.It diverted food to the hungry in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor and Johor.In May alone, TLFP distributed about 60 tonnes of food, shared between 67 charity organisations.Since June 1, only about 20 volunteers have been on the ground to sort through tonnes of food and ensure they are fit for human consumption before packing them for distribution.“Much of the food is actually still of high quality, but the vendors are not able to sell them on the particular day, ” said TLFP general manager Mohd Syazwan Mokhtar.Items of lower quality and unsuitable for people will be sent to its composting partner or the National Zoo to feed the animals.Mohd Syazwan said that despite the amount of food collected by TLFP, food was scarce for the long list of charities waiting to be included as beneficiaries.“Our operations are mainly supported through donations from the public and corporate sector, and we try to deliver food to the charities daily.“We see ourselves as supporters of an ecosystem that is already quite strong, by supplying charities and NGOs with food or preparing ready cooked meals, ” he said.He added that TLFP also distributed food to B40 households in Lembah Pantai, Batu and Setiawangsa, in Kuala Lumpur, as well as in Klang and Petaling Jaya in Selangor.”Mohd Syazwan said TLFP was a charity organisation and a logistics NGO, which was like a hub or middleman between the industry players and the beneficiaries, while dealing with surplus goods directly from retailers, suppliers or even manufacturers.“We also work with wholesale markets such as Pasar Borong Kuala Lumpur, which is our biggest contributor for fresh vegetables every month.“I don’t think there is ever going to be enough supply as demand is always high. Many people are struggling, even before the MCO, ” he said.“In February and March, we received between 80 and 100 tonnes of supplies a month from the wholesale market, but it dropped to 50 tonnes in April and 40 tonnes in May, also due to factors of supply from farms.”Mohd Syazwan said TLFP had received distress calls for aid in recent weeks and was helping to distribute non-food products as well.“We have seen our beneficiary base increase exponentially since last year and there are definitely more people out there in need.”He added that TLFP was fortunate to be able to make up for it when manufacturers provide more non-fresh food alternatives during the period.“One of the blessings to come out of this pandemic is seeing people willing to help in a crisis, ” he said."

"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",,Metro,EDWARD RAJENDRA,Mitigation work to end flood woes,"RESIDENTS living in a flood-prone part of Taman Seah Hong in Klang can rest easy as several mitigation measures have been planned for the neighbourhood.The measures, which include widening a 390m drain stretch along Jalan Pekan Baru 26 and building a detention pond on a small plot of land sandwiched between Jalan Pekan Baru 26 and 27, will be carried out following a proposal by Klang Municipal Council’s (MPK) Engineering Department.MPK councillor Low Kwee Sia said the department proposed building a detention pond, which would hold rainwater runoff to be released at a predetermined rate, and widening the drain to curb flash floods that had been plaguing families living here.Taman Seah Hong has about 150 terrace houses.The flood mitigation project is slated to start in October and be completed by February next year.The floods have caused a lot of anxiety, especially for senior citizens who have been living in the area since the late 1970s.Resident Chung King Chai, 75, said heavy rain would cause water in the drains to overflow and reach knee height, making the roads in the neighbourhood impassable.“The water inundates the terrace houses in the area, causing damage to our belongings.“It is tough as we are saddled with the clean-up each time floods occur, ” he told StarMetro.Soh Chwee Yan, 73, said floods had been a growing problem since mid-2010.“Surrounding areas have been concreted and cannot soak up rainwater, so during downpours, rainwater has nowhere to go except into drains consequently overwhelming them and causing flash floods, ” she said.Another resident, TA Yang, 71, said people in the neighbourhood were fearful whenever there was a thunderstorm and worried that water would come rushing into their homes, destroying furniture and electrical items.According to residents, it usually takes up to two hours for floodwaters to subside.Yang and other residents urged MPK to speed up the flood mitigation project.Low, who visited the area, said he would keep the residents updated on the project.“MPK’s Engineering Department has assured the people in Taman Seah Hong that the flash floods issue will be resolved with the proposed project.“I have accepted the department’s professional advice and I will keep tabs on the project once it starts, ” he said.On an unrelated matter, Low asked MPK to address complaints of stagnant water near tents that house the temporary wholesale section of Pasar Besar Meru.“Water from the section stagnates outside the tents and it smells bad.“We want the matter resolved quickly as it involves hygiene, ” he said during a site visit.Klang Market Traders Association president Ng Soo Keong told StarMetro that he had asked for three spotlights to be installed in front of Blocks A and B as it was pitch-dark in the wee hours of the morning.“In February, I requested MPK to put up spotlights for the safety of customers, traders and workers.“But until now, no action has been taken, ” he said.Ng added that MPK should also improve the water pressure in the toilets at the market as hygiene would be compromised otherwise."
"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",8:05 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Bikers in Benghazi rev up motors to showcase their war-scarred country,"Bikers of Libya’s Mediterranean city of Benghazi, the cradle of its 2011 revolution and a one-time Islamist bastion, rev up their motors to show another side to their war-scarred country.In a cocktail of gleaming chrome and rumbling engines, dozens of heavy-duty motorbike enthusiasts in their leathers tear up the asphalt in regular parades through the streets of the wind-strewn city.The convoy of Harley Davidsons, Hondas and Kawasa-kis emerges from the headquarters of the Benghazi Motorcycles Club.For the club’s members, biking is not only a passion, it’s also a way of portraying the city in a different light – a semblance of normality despite Libya’s pervasive divisions and violence.“There are those who fight, and there are those who have a passion, ” the club’s proud president Ahmed al-Fitouri says from behind a thick beard and long hair.“We’ve had French and British crews film us, and we’ve shown them that not all Libyans make war, they’re not all criminals, ” he says.Two by two, the bikers parade through Benghazi’s alleys and main roads, arms perched on the handlebars.Onlookers watch or film and honking car drivers contribute to the cacophony as they ride past war-battered buildings.The motorcycle club, which has a Harley Davidson-inspired eagle as its emblem, boasts 120 members and they are “all enthusiasts”, says Fitouri.It was established in 2014 on the initiative of a group of amateurs, right in the thick of a second battle for control of their city, three years after the fall of Libya’s longtime leader Moamer Kadhafi.Even at that time of rampant insecurity before Islamist militias were expelled, club members staged public shows.Before the revolt that put an end to more than four decades of dictatorship, bikers were “marginalised” members of Benghazi society, says Fakhri Mustapha al-Hassi, the club’s vice president.“But that image has changed, ” says Hassi, a lively character sporting a leather waistcoat and a black bandana.“Now families and children come to have their picture taken with us.”Club members also raise funds for charities, stage “parades for peace” and take part in official functions, such as a recent tribute to Omar al-Mokhtar, a hero of Libya’s resistance to Italian occupation in the early 20th century.During Ramadan, the bikers distributed snacks and drinks to motorists running late for iftar. All this “gives a good image” of the country, club president Fitouri says. – AFP Relaxnews"

"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,,Online therapy works for social anxiety in teens,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) can cause considerable suffering in children and adolescents.In addition, access to effective treatment is limited for many with the disorder, which was previously known as social phobia.Researchers at the Centre for Psychiatry Research at Karolinska Institutet and the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services at Region Stockholm in Sweden, have now shown that internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an efficacious and cost-effective treatment option.SAD has a typical onset during childhood and is characterised by an intense and persistent fear of being scrutinised and negatively evaluated in social or performance situations.The fear typically leads to avoidance of such anxiety-triggering situations or are endured under great distress, resulting in an impaired ability to function in everyday life.The disability can lead to underperformance in school, social isolation from peers and an inability to partake in leisure activities.As one of the most common anxiety disorders among youth, the disorder affects 5% to 10% of the youth population.Without effective treatment, it has been linked to long-term psychosocial adversity and persistence into adulthood.Despite known evidence-based treatments for SAD, such as CBT, the access to effective treatment is very limited.As a means to increase access, the researchers developed and evaluated a 10-week internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) programme for young people with SAD.The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was conducted between 2017 and 2020, and included 103 youths aged 10 to 17, along with their parents.Participants were randomly assigned to either ICBT or an active control group, which provided internet-delivered supportive therapy.Both interventions included 10 online treatment modules with weekly therapist support and three video sessions with the therapist.Parents received five online modules in parallel with therapist support.The results showed that ICBT was significantly more effective than supportive therapy in reducing social anxiety and concurrent psychiatric symptoms, as well as in increasing the level of overall functioning.The superiority of ICBT was shown in evaluations of participants’ symptoms made by assessors who were unaware of which treatment group the participants were in, as well as in ratings by participants themselves and their parents.According to the researchers, the digital format can also increase access to evidence-based treatment for children and adolescents with SAD.“Offering treatment digitally means that children and parents don’t have to take time off school and work to travel to a healthcare facility,” says psychologist and study first author Martina Nordh.“We also believe it may lower the threshold to seeking treatment, as young people with SAD can find it too challenging to meet with unfamiliar people and to be in a new setting.”The total time spent by the therapists on ICBT was about a quarter of the time normally required by face-to-face CBT for SAD.“Shorter therapist time enables each therapist to treat more patients and may lead to reduction of waiting times,” says child and adolescent psychiatrist and study principal investigator Dr Eva Serlachius.“This also makes digital CBT less costly for healthcare services and resources can be redistributed to those with greater need of more intensive treatment.”The researchers are now working on a joint project with Region Stockholm’s Internet treatment unit within the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services to plan for the implementation and dissemination of the programme via a Swedish national platform.The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, and Region Stockholm."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",1:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,DR MILTON LUM,Should pregnant women get the Covid-19 vaccine?,"There are about 500,000 births annually in Malaysia.As some pregnancies end up in miscarriages, it would be reasonable to assume that there are about 600,000 pregnancies annually.The jury is still out on some pundits’ prediction that there will be an increase in pregnancies this year (2021) due to the movement control order, although the Chief Statistician did report that there was actually a decrease in the number of babies born in the first quarter of the year.The information in this article is from international reviews.The current evidence suggests that the likelihood of pregnant women getting Covid-19 is similar to that of other healthy adults.About two-thirds of the infected pregnant have no symptoms (i.e. are asymptomatic).Most of the infected have mild symptoms like that of the common cold or flu.However, a small number can get moderate to severe disease.Pregnant women with Covid-19 may be at increased risk of severe disease compared to the non-pregnant, especially during their last trimester (three months) of pregnancy.As a precaution, the pregnant have been included in the list of those at moderate risk of Covid-19 in most countries.No reported ill effectsPregnant women in Malaysia are eligible to be registered for Covid-19 vaccination.As vaccination is currently voluntary, it is their choice to either go ahead and be vaccinated, or await more information about the vaccines.In my last column, I discussed how Covid-19 could potentially affect pregnant women and newborns.Those factors are among those that should be considered when pregnant women make their decision as to whether or not to get vaccinated.Pregnant women were not included in any of the clinical trials that tested the safety and effectiveness of the various Covid-19 vaccines.This means that information about the effects of such vaccination in pregnancy is limited.As such, no one can be 100% sure whether or not the vaccines will cause adverse events in pregnancy.This uncertainty has to be considered against the risk of developing Covid-19 while pregnant.A small number of women who received the vaccines in the trials did however subsequently became pregnant.No safety problems were reported in those cases.Data from the United States, where about 90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated (mainly with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines), have not raised any safety concerns.Covid-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients known to be harmful to either pregnant women or the fetus.Animal studies have also shown no evidence that the vaccine causes harm to the pregnancy.Furthermore, pregnant women have been receiving vaccines like tetanus toxoid, influenza and pertussis, without any reported harm to their foetuses.The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine triggers an immune response with SARS-CoV-2 viral spike proteins produced within the body from mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) strands that are part of the vaccine.The AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine works the same way, except that it uses DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) strands instead of mRNA.The Sinovac vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, i.e. it consists of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles that have been killed.These vaccines all do not contain the live virus, hence they cannot infect the pregnant woman or her foetus.According to the Government, pregnant women in Malaysia will be offered the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, but not the AstraZeneca/Oxford or Sinovac ones.Rare side effectsVaccination is effective in preventing disease.Even if one gets infected with Covid-19 despite being vaccinated, the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death is minimised.Vaccination itself will not cause Covid-19.Side effects from vaccination are common in the general population.They include pain at the injection site, muscle ache, headache, fatigue and joint ache.Allergic reactions, which are very rare, occur in those with a history of allergy.These side effects have not been reported to have affected pregnancy.Media focus on blood clots (thrombosis) with Covid-19 vaccines have caused unnecessary anxiety and fear.The European Medicines Agency estimates that the risk of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) after receiving the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine is 5.0 (on average from a range of 4.3 to 5.8) per million people.University of Oxford Academic Clinical Fellow Dr Maxime Taquet and colleagues recently reviewed US data from more than a million people.Of those diagnosed with Covid-19, the incidence of CVT was 39 per million people.In those who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna), the incidence was 4.1 per million.The risk of CVT therefore, was 10 times higher in Covid-19 patients, compared with those who were vaccinated.The normal risk of thrombosis in the pregnant in Malaysia ranges from 500 to 2,000 per million.Vaccine timingVaccination early in pregnancy offers early protection.As pregnancy lasts nine months, the question is whether there is still protection at the end of the pregnancy as there is still uncertainty about the duration of protection after completion of the two-dose vaccines.Vaccination after the first trimester (three months) offers better protection against Covid-19, which has been associated with more complications in the third trimester.The first trimester is a time when foetal development occurs and the risk of miscarriage is highest.Although there is a lack of evidence that the Covid-19 vaccines affect foetal development, it is recommended that vaccination begins after the first trimester.This prudent approach avoids suspicion of links, even if coincidental, between vaccination, pregnancy and foetal harm.It is possible to continue the second vaccine dose in women who conceive soon after receiving their first dose.However, the second dose can also be delayed until after the end of the first trimester.The second dose of the current mRNA vaccines have been delayed up to 12 weeks after the first dose in several countries because of availability issues, without significant impact on protection of the recipients.However, whether this effect in the general population is also applicable to the pregnant is an unanswered question.There is currently no data on delaying the second dose with the Sinovac and Sputnik V vaccines.This problem may be resolved by the single-dose vaccines, e.g. Johnson & Johnson and CanSino, which are yet to be registered in Malaysia.Take home messageA discussion with your attending doctor will be helpful in addressing any questions about Covid-19 vaccination in pregnancy.It is important to avoid anyone who has symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 even after vaccination.It would also be prudent to adhere to the non-pharmacological interventions of:Physical distancing, particularly in the third trimesterFace mask-wearingFrequent handwashing with water and soap, or hand sanitising with minimum 60% alcohol-based hand sanitiserAvoidance of crowds, confined spaces and close contactsProper coughing and sneezing etiquetteStaying home as much as possible, andSeeking medical attention promptly when unwell.Dr Milton Lum is a past president of the Federation of Private Medical Practitioners

"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",8:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,MICHAEL CHEANG,"Tipsy-Turvy: What is a cocktail shaker, and other tools of the bartending trade?","Well, here we are, stuck at home again. I guess it’s back to making drinks at home again, huh?Well, since we’ve already covered what sorts of spirits, liqueurs, and syrups you should have in your home bar, let us now talk about the sort of tools you need to recreate your favourite cocktails at home.Now, before we get into the sorts of bar tools that are out there, it should be pointed out that you don’t HAVE to get these tools for your home, as there are plenty of utensils in your kitchen that can be used for the same purpose. For instance, a cookie jar can be used as a cocktail shaker, baking measuring spoons can replace jiggers, a chopstick can stir a drink just as well as a fancy bar spoon... well, you get the picture.However, while these replacements will get your drink made, they don’t offer the same experience as using some proper bar tools.ADVERTISING“We feel that having the right tools will give you more joy and better results in what you are making, ” says Nathan Pinto, co-founder of The 4 Barmen, a Malaysian startup that specialises in making good quality and affordable bar tools.“Sure, you can mix cocktails using a water jug at home, however, with a proper cocktail shaker, you have better control when mixing and shaking drinks with finesse.“Working with ‘make-do’ tools will get the job done, but using proper tools, the whole experience will be exceptionally better and becomes more fun. The results also taste and look better, ” Pinto adds.The 4 Barmen was formed when the four founders – who are cocktail enthusiasts, but not professional bartenders – realised that the options for bar tools in the Malaysian market were limited. Hence, they decided to take matters into their own hands and set up a store offering high quality bar tools and glassware at a reasonable price, with more elegant finishes, in order to inspire Malaysians to create more cocktails at home. Their store includes three levels of Starter kits suitable for home bartenders, depending on the skill level of the user.With that in mind, let’s learn about the different sorts of bartools and what they are used for, with some help from bartender Shawn Chong of the Mizukami Collective and Bar Class Academy Asia.ShakerThe primary function of a shaker is to mix, chill, aerate, and dilute a cocktail. There are two main types of shakers that are commonly used in bars – the Cobbler and the Boston.The main difference between the two is obviously the shape and size. Also known as a three-piece shaker, the Cobbler is the one that looks like a little metal bottle, while the larger Boston shaker is commonly made up of two large vessels, usually made of metal, though some are a combination of metal and glass vessels.“A Cobbler shaker generally fits one or two drinks depending on volume, while a Boston can accommodate three to four, ” Chong says.“The Boston shaker is also more efficient in making drinks that have solid items like fruit, herbs and spices as well as well drinks that call for cream or dairy. The space in the shaker eases the frothing capability.”According to him, the Boston shaker is also more versatile as open vessels are easier and faster to clean, so a Boston Shaker wins on hygiene.The cobbler shaker, on the other hand, has an in-built strainer at the top and so is favourable for cocktails that don't call for any fresh herbs, purees or pulp.JiggerWith a distinctive hourglass shape, the jigger is a bartenders' measuring tool.“Just like baking, accuracy is required to create balanced cocktails by respecting the proportions a recipe calls for. It's far faster and more efficient than using a scale, though a scale would win at point accuracy, ” says Chong.Mixing GlassA mixing glass is used to stir a cocktail rather than shake it, as this allows you to maintain better control over the amount of dilution, and also maintain the texture and viscosity of the drink better.Sure, you can just use a normal glass or a jar to mix drinks, but many bartenders tend to use specially crafted mixing glasses. This is not just for the aesthetics – some professional mixing glasses, like the Yarai mixing glass (named after the Japanese diamond pattern etched on the outside) are made with a heavy base, uses thicker glass, has a spout at the top for easy pouring, and the pattern at the side makes it easier to hold while using.Bar spoonA spoon is just a spoon, right? Well, not when it’s a bar spoon. “While its primary function is for stirring cocktails, It can also be used to measure smaller quantities instead of using a jigger, as a bar spoon usually measures three to four millilitres of liquid, ” says Chong.A bar spoon can also be used for layering spirits on top of one another, either by pouring the spirit over the underside of the spoon, or by using the spiral stem.Some bar spoons also either come with a fork on the other end (which can be used for skewering garnishes or squeezing citrus directly from fruit wedges), or a muddler. Which brings us to...MuddlerThe muddler is used to crush fruits, herbs or spices to extract its flavour properties. The size of the muddler doesn't matter, though a larger one usually requires less effort.StrainerBartenders commonly use two types of strainers – Hawthorne strainers and conventional mesh strainers.A Hawthorne strainer is usually paired with a Boston shaker to hold muddled items and ice, as the ice shouldn't be reused once a drink is made. It commonly comes with prongs that sit at the lip of the shaker.""A Hawthorne Strainer with no prongs serves the same purpose but is very useful for bartenders to use the ‘throw’ technique,"" says Chong. ""The throw technique allows for a slower dilution rate than shaking and more aeration than stirring yielding a different end result to a cocktail.""According to Chong, most of the time, a normal mesh strainer would be sufficient for straining your drinks, but there are times when you need to ‘fine strain’ it as well.Fine straining means using both a Hawthorne Strainer AND a mesh strainer together in order to effectively remove any smaller particles that a Hawthorne can't hold back. It is also used to ensure a nice smooth froth/foam should the cocktail need it.Bar bladeA bar blade is a bottle opener that's meant for high volume bars where bottled drinks like beer are served a lot, according to Chong.“Its length usually causes the blade protrude from a bartender's pocket for easy access and with a long blade it creates a better fulcrum making it easier to open the caps. The long blade also allows bartenders to do tricks/flair in hopes to earn some tips!” he says.Michael Cheang used to shake cocktails using a plastic cookie jar. Now he has a proper shaker and is not afraid to use it. Follow him on Facebook (fb.com/mytipsyturvy), Instagram (@MyTipsyTurvy) or Twitter (@MichaelCheang)."

"Wednesday, 19 May 2021",10:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,SUZANNE LAZAROO,From the archives: The many types of laksa in Malaysia,"A 'laksa war' has broken out amongst Malaysian netizens recently. But what are the different types of laksa in Malaysia? Here is a story from our archives where we explored the different interpretations in each state and region.This story originally appeared on StarLifestyle in two parts on 27 August and 3 September 2017, and has been edited for brevity and clarity.Flavour-drenched, hit-the-spot comfort food, a rush of spices or a hit of bracing tang, made with wheat noodles, rice noodles or even al dente spaghetti – laksa has many faces, and they’re all delicious.At its heart, it’s a dish of noodles in a spiced gravy, which can have a creamy coconut milk base or a sour asam base. A bowlful then brims with fish flakes, prawns, chicken and even blood cockles or roast pork, and shredded cucumber, pineapple, bean sprouts and herbs... and often, a spoonful of fiery sambal or pungent prawn paste, making the dish further customisable to each diner.In Malaysia, the different incarnations of laksa are bound by more than just a loose structure and character, of noodles in gravy – daun kesum is also called laksa leaf, because it’s used so extensively in the various versions of the dish. Most laksas are perfumed by it, along with other herbs and spices.Sound simple? It’s not. Here, almost every state has its own version of laksa, and broad interpretations of the one dish can also span hazy regional borders – such as laksam which is a white-on-white dish of thick, rustic rice noodle rolls in a pale, rich gravy of coconut milk and fish (or more rarely, eel), popular in the northern states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Kedah.ADVERTISING“When you look at the styles in Peninsular Malaysia especially, it feels like there is a natural geographical progression from north to south, from the more sour, thin gravies to the creamy, rich ones, ” said celebrity chef Isadora Chai.“Malaysians are very familiar with and possessive of their own regional or state laksas – I think there’s an emotional connection for a lot of people, who have been eating a particular laksa all their lives, ” she said.You also find laksa in Thailand, where it’s called khanom jeen, made with rice noodles and also manifesting in various incarnations, and in Indonesia, where permutations of the dish are specific to towns and cities. In Singapore, the coconut milk-based Katong laksa is extremely popular, traceable to the Straits Chinese community based in the Katong precinct.There are various origin theories for laksa – in different countries, usually traceable to interactions between Chinese traders or settlers, who brought their own thin noodle soups with them, and locals, who then decked out those broths with local herbs and spices, and coconut milk.While it’s difficult to pinpoint its specific origins in Malaysia, in states like Melaka and Penang especially – both enclaves of the Peranakan community – the dish seems to have been born among the ranks of the Peranakans, the descendants of Chinese traders marrying local Malays.What is evident though, as you contemplate such a lush bowl of plenty, is that it is a fusion of sorts, in the best sense of the word – cultures, states and regions contributing various elements to come up with an extremely delicious whole.Currying flavourCurry laksa is thick and rich, with just a hint of sweetness from the addition of thick coconut milk.Possibly the best examples are the ones you find in the Klang Valley and Melaka, which are usually garnished with tofu pok (bean curd puffs), chicken, fish cake slices, prawns, blood cockles and long beans. The finishing touch? That spoonful of sambal and a scattering of mint.""Melaka laksa is quite straightforward to cook, because there’s no fish involved, you don’t have to flake the fish flesh, so it’s the fastest to cook, ” said recipe developer and cookbook author Debbie Teoh.In Penang, where curry laksa is also known as curry mee, there are two variants of the dish using yellow Hokkien noodles – one served doused in chicken curry the colour of a fiery sunrise, the other in a pale, thin coconut milk base (this has now come to be known as white curry mee).Aromatic chilli paste is then added according to one’s taste. In white curry mee, the Chinese side of laksa’s identity is manifested strongly – via cubes of congealed pork blood!“Curry mee is what I’d choose if I wanted something creamy yet light, ” said Teoh.Asam-based laksasThe thin, sour laksas spiked with asam are usually made with asam gelugor, dried slices of the Garcinia atroviridis fruit, with its slightly astringent, clean sour hit that makes your lips pucker, as opposed to the sweet-sour pulp of asam jawa or tamarind (Tamarindus indica). Some laksas use a combination of the two and in a pinch, you can sub one for the other – only the very discerning will notice the rounder, fuller mouthfeel of tamarind.Sour, spicy and laden with the intensely fishy appeal of flaked mackerel, then perked up with turmeric and freshened with pineapple, chilli, mint, laksa leaves and bunga kantan (torch ginger flower), Penang’s asam laksa is deservedly famous – and it’s still not asam laksa until a spoonful of pungent hae kor (fermented prawn paste) is stirred into the heady mix.“Ikan parang is the best fish to use – it’s sweet, with a melt-in-the-mouth texture – but it’s also the most work to get the flesh off the many small bones, ” said Teoh.In July 2011, CNN Travel ranked the dish at No. 7 for deliciousness, in a list of 50 foods in the world (later that year, a public poll saw it fall to the 26th rung though).Perlis and Kedah laksas are similar, but the former is often made with catfish or eel, while the latter sees hard-boiled egg slices added, as well as various ulam. Malay sellers tend to serve it with a spoonful of sambal nyiur, or coconut sambal.In this way, laksa also illustrates the differences in area, highlighting the produce farmed or produced in a state – such as the use of freshwater eels, fresh rice noodles in the rice-rich northern states, or the fact that Johor doesn’t really grow rice much – as well as cultural influences from the ethnic communities in an area.Hybrid offeringsAnd then there are laksas that defy convention like the laksa Siam found in Penang and Kedah that is a further fusion of both asam and curry laksa!This rich laksa is sour and fishy like asam laksa, and rich with spices and coconut cream at the same time – what you would call the best of both worlds.In Johor, the creamy laksa gravy – enriched with asam gelugor as well as lemongrass, galangal and dried prawns – is characteristically served with spaghetti, making its fusion roots stretch further beyond borders than most.According to Kalsom Taib and Hamidah Abdul Hamid in Johor Palate: Tanjung Puteri Recipes, Johor’s well-travelled Sultan Abu Bakar (who ruled the state from 1886 to 1895) loved pasta from his first visit to Italy; he instructed his chefs to switch out the traditional noodles for the pasta, and Johor laksa was born.Heading EastOn Malaysia’s East Coast, a tale of two laksas is told.Skirting the coasts of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang – and finding their way to Johor on occasion – these are the Rose Red and Snow White of a very different (and delicious) fairy tale.Siblings, they are laced with the fish and coconut milk that you would expect from their lands of origin, but manifest quite differently.The kuah putih, or white gravy, sees its noodles in a simpler, cleaner, milder gravy. It’s particularly popular in Kelantan, where it’s synonymous with the eponymous Laksa Kelantan.In the state, its purity of colour is maintained by the common use of tenggiri, with its marble-pale flesh, in homes. If you buy it from a street vendor though, you’re likely to find the cheaper ikan kembung instead.Laksa kuah putih gives the humble white pepper a dominant role in a way that few dishes do – it’s the predominant flavour in the thick coconut milk gravy, with a supporting cast of shallots, ginger and lemongrass. A squeeze of lime freshens the gravy after its slow cooking treatment.It’s a gravy that is similar to the one that bathes laksam; what differentiates them is the thick, rustic rice rolls that you’ll find in laksam.Both dishes are finished with a generous handful of vegetables and fragrant herbs – finely-sliced long beans, bean sprouts, cucumber, with Thai (daun selasih) or holy (daun kemangi) basil and the ubiquitous laksa leaf (daun kesum).“Terengganu is the only state where both laksa kuah putih and kuah merah – which we also call ‘kuah masak’ – are offered alongside for choice in the markets, ” To’ Puan Rosita Abdullah, author of Kayu Manis: A Tribute to Terengganu told Flavours magazine in a 2012 article.“The Terengganu kuah masak uses less fish, unlike in Pahang, where the gravy is thicker. The laksa paste can easily be bought in the market and fish used could be tenggiri, kembung or selayang.“The fresh green topping can include shredded brinjal and daun jambu golok (cashew nut shoots).”Because of its comparative mildness, you’ll find laksa kuah putih eaten for breakfast more often.Also based on coconut milk, kuah merah has extra fish power – in addition to the fresh ikan kembung or tenggiri it’s usually made with, the deeper, more layered flavour of salted fish is also often discernible.In addition to the other toppings, the intensely orange-yolked salted duck egg can also be a topping, as can daun kaduk (wild pepper leaf).“People usually make one or the other, ” said Datin Munira Salinger, in Red & White Laksas (Flavours, 2012).In the Pahang-born former teacher’s autobiography, My Story, you’ll find illustrations of her long-held enthusiasm for researching the history and culture of Malay food in particular, with some of her favourite recipes.She says that the kuah merah is a grander dish with more planning and prep involved, and so usually saved for more elaborate functions, rather than one-dish meals at home.“It is something that one gives to family members living nearby – often sent in a tiffin carrier as a gift, and one would provide enough to feed the whole family, ” she said.Sarawakian sensationHopping across the South China Sea, you’ll find Sarawak Laksa – a dish so fabulously rich that it sees foodies’ ears pricking up all over the country at the mere mention.While its home state boasts the most proliferation, you’ll also find it in Sabah, and in neighbouring Brunei.The fact that Sarawak laksa is made from a paste with a multitude of ingredients that also remains a jealously-guarded secret only adds to its mystery-wreathed allure.Often, when you find the dish on a menu in Peninsular Malaysia, it’s been made with the paste specially-ordered from Sarawak; a few adventurous chefs do attempt to replicate it solely by taste, but Sarawak laksa is unique in its common status as being more often made from a paste made and imported from its home state. This is so even when the dish is cooked at home.The fiery, crimson gravy is laced with spices like cumin, star anise, fennel, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, white pepper and coriander, and includes a chunk of belacan along with the ginger, chillies, lemongrass, galangal and shallots. Both chicken and prawn stocks are used, and there are also roasted, ground peanuts, sesame seeds and candlenuts in there.That explains its distinctive, delicious complexity and richness, but the key is in getting the ratio of every ingredient right.Its origins, like those of many local dishes, are anchored more in lore than stone.There’s a legend that in 1945, Goh Lik Teck, a Teochew migrant from Guangzhou, China, started selling a simpler version of the dish – with just six ingredients – in Kuching’s Carpenter Street.Another story has the laksa emerging from the Chinese and Malay cultural collusion, rather than just one noodle-seller.In the 1960s, Goh’s family started making and selling the paste to other vendors; around the same time, businessman Tan Yong Him started selling the paste commercially under the Swallow brand, and other bird-oriented brands soon followed suit.Laksa paste and intense gravy aside, the other building blocks of Sarawak laksa are rice vermicelli, shreds of chicken and omelette, prawns and fresh coriander leaves. A spoonful of piquant sambal and lime halves are always served on the side.And that’s the dish that Anthony Bourdain tweeted was the “breakfast of the gods” in 2015, when he revisited Kuching’s famous Choon Hui Cafe for CNN’s Parts Unknown; it was his second visit to the very same coffee shop, after his 2005 stop there for the Travel Channel’s No Reservations.Order popular Malaysian cuisine at discounted prices by using foodpanda Voucher"

The takeaway sets also includea selection of sweet treats such as pomelo sago, pineapple tart, nutmeg madeleines and soursop pops.The Malam Warisan Melayu Box is priced at RM448+ (serves up to four people) and RM888+ (for up to eight people). Orders must be placed 48 hours in advance.This offer continues even after Ramadan.ST REGIS KUALA LUMPUR, No.6, Jalan Stesen Sentral 2, Kuala Lumpur. (Tel: 03-2727 6696).

"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,Tech,LAURA MILLAN LOMBRANA，WILL MATHIS，JOAO LIMA,Renewable energy boom unleashes a war over talent for green jobs,"Clean energy giants are finding a shortage of workers with the skills needed to support their ambitious growth plans.The renewables jobs market is heating up and candidates with the right abilities are becoming harder to find, according to Miguel Stilwell, chief executive officer at Portuguese clean-energy firm EDP Renovaveis SA. The company is one of the world’s top installers of green power and plans to hire 1,300 employees over the next two years.""There’s a war over talent globally,” Stilwell said in an interview on May 28. ""The renewable sector, given the massive amount of growth that is expected, doesn’t have enough people.”As countries funnel billions of dollars into developing renewable power, policymakers are banking on the sector to create new jobs that are crucial for the post-pandemic economic recovery.Solar generation capacity is expected to triple by the end of the decade, while wind capacity is expected to more than double over the same period, according to clean energy research group BloombergNEF.Green supermajors such as NextEra Energy Inc, Iberdrola SA, Enel SpA and EDP are leading the race to electrify the global economy. But some large oil companies are starting to get into the sector too, with BP Plc announcing last month it’s looking to fill 100 offshore-wind jobs in the UK and the US, a figure that could double by the end of the year.Engineering skills such as energy assessment, project management and project design are in high demand, EDP’s Stilwell said. Good business developers who understand clean energy technologies are also a scarce resource. Other roles, such as managing mergers and acquisitions, or back office tasks, can easily be hired from other industries.""We’re having to bring in people from other sectors, whether it’s oil and gas or other parts of the energy industry, or recruiting directly from universities,"" Stilwell said. ""There’s a lot of competition out there.”Engineering and chemistry graduates working on a masters degrees in renewables at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya in Barcelona are often hired while they’re still in school, or right after they finish, according to Professor Jordi Llorca.The university has partnerships with other colleges in Europe and students often get hired to work in other countries like the UK or Denmark, said Llorca, who is also the director of an engineering research center at the university.""We need to be fast to adapt the contents of our programs on the energy transition and renewable energies to make sure our graduates are competitive in the market,” Llorca said. ""We’re constantly looking at the contracts and agreements we have with different industries to see what's needed.”The university launched a masters in hydrogen energy last year after professors realised very few people have the skills in mechanics and chemistry that the fast-growing sector will need very soon. ""There’s always a moment of vacuum whenever a new technology comes in, but we’re able to put together new programs in just a few months.”Offshore wind farms are another growth area. The projects involve erecting and maintaining wind turbines the size of skyscrapers miles out to sea. A single turn of one of the massive blades could power a house for two days. The industry was pioneered in Europe, but is now rapidly expanding to Asia and the east coast of the US.Those new markets don’t have people with experience. That means that developers are often sending British and European employees to lead the way, according to Clint Harrison, director at renewable energy-focused recruitment firm Taylor Hopkinson. But as business takes off there’s pressure to hire locally.The limits of a well-trained workforce could end up being a bottleneck in an industry that is key to slashing emissions.""There’s a sense of urgency,” Harrison said. ""The market is growing very, very quickly and we need to ensure we have the right people across various projects and regions to ensure projects move forward and aren’t delayed.”In the UK alone, around 200,000 skilled workers will be needed in the offshore energy sector by 2030, up from 160,000 today, according to a recent report by the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen.About half the jobs are expected to be filled by people transferring from the oil and gas sector and about 90% of current workers in the fossil-fuel sector can be retrained for renewables, said author Paul de Leeuw.""Demand for courses on renewable energy and the energy transition is ramping up rapidly and at the same time we see demand for oil courses declining,” he said. ""It’s a societal and industry shift mirroring in the education system.” – Bloomberg"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",11:03 PM MYT,Tech,STEPHANIE KELLY，JESSICA RESNICK-AULT,"One password allowed hackers to disrupt Colonial Pipeline, CEO tells senators","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of Colonial Pipeline told U.S. senators on Tuesday that hackers who launched last month's cyber attack against the company and disrupted fuel supplies to the U.S. Southeast were able to get into the system by stealing a single password.Colonial Pipeline Chief Executive Joseph Blount told a U.S. Senate committee that the attack occurred using a legacy Virtual Private Network (VPN) system that did not have multifactor authentication in place. That means it could be accessed through a password without a second step such as a text message, a common security safeguard in more recent software.""In the case of this particular legacy VPN, it only had single-factor authentication,"" Blount said. ""It was a complicated password, I want to be clear on that. It was not a Colonial123-type password.""The panel was convened to examine threats to critical U.S. infrastructure and the Colonial attack, which shut key conduits delivering fuel from Gulf Coast refineries to major East Coast markets. Cyberattacks also hit U.S. meatpacking plants owned by JBS, showing the breadth of infrastructure facing cyber threats.The Colonial Pipeline hack demonstrated that much of the company's infrastructure remains highly vulnerable and the government and companies must work harder to prevent future hacks, senators said during the hearing.Security experts call the use of a single-factor login system a sign of poor cybersecurity ""hygiene."" They recommend two-factor authentication, which requires a secondary measure like a mobile text or hardware token, and most major companies require this across all internal applications.Senators questioned Blount about the company's preparations and the timeline for responding to the ransomware attack, which shut the line for days and led to a spike in gasoline prices, panic buying and localized fuel shortages.""I'm alarmed this breach ever occurred in the first place,"" said Senator Gary Peters, the committee's chairman. ""Make no mistake: if we do not step up our cyber security readiness, the consequences will be severe.""The FBI attributed the hack to a gang called DarkSide. Some senators suggested Colonial had not sufficiently consulted with the U.S. government before paying the ransom against federal guidelines.Blount said he made the decision to pay ransom and to keep the payment as confidential as possible because of concern for security.""It was our understanding that the decision was solely ours to make about whether to pay the ransom,"" he said.Blount said Colonial did not have a plan in place to prevent a ransomware attack, but did have an emergency response plan. The company notified the FBI within hours.Blount said Colonial has invested over $200 million over the last five years in its IT systems. When pressed to answer how much Colonial has spent to keep its pipeline cyber secure, Blount repeated that amount. A company spokesperson later clarified the $200 million was for IT overall, which includes cyber security.On Friday, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco urged companies to tell federal authorities whether they paid ransom to cyberattackers, information that can help investigators.Blount said even after getting the key from the hackers, the company is still recovering from the attack and is bringing back seven finance systems that have been offline since May 7.On Monday, the Justice Department said it had recovered some $2.3 million in cryptocurrency ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline.Colonial Pipeline previously had said it paid the hackers nearly $5 million to regain access. The value of the cryptocurrency bitcoin has dropped to below $35,000 in recent weeks after hitting a high of $63,000 in April.As a result, the government recovered about 60 of the 75 bitcoin paid, but the value has dropped, falling short of the total dollar amount Colonial paid.Bitcoin seizures are rare, but authorities have stepped up their expertise in tracking the flow of digital money as ransomware has become a growing national security threat and put a further strain on relations between the United States and Russia, where many of the gangs are based."

They came back after outages that ranged from a few minutes to around an hour early in the morning in the United States but middle of the day in Europe.""Our global network is coming back online,"" Fastly said.One of the world's most widely-used cloud-based content delivery network providers, the company earlier reported a disruption from a ""service configuration"" and did not explain.""Incidents like this underline the fragility of the internet and its dependence on a patchwork of fragmented technology. Ironically, this also underlines its inherent strength and how quickly it can recover,"" Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said.""The fact that an outage like this can grab headlines around the world shows how rare it is.""Typical service configurations for a cloud service provider can include updating security rules to protect information, or instructing a server to refresh the contents of a news site before serving it to a customer, said Andy Champagne, senior vice president at Akamai, a cloud service company.A simple typo can be propagated to thousands of servers and cause disruptions, he said.Fastly, which went public in 2019 and has a market capitalization of under $6 billion, is far smaller than peers like Amazon's AWS. The company's content delivery network (CDN) helps websites move content using less-congested routes, enabling them to reach consumers faster.""In the grand scheme of things, we actually think that this is a little bit of a positive for other CDNs and also just shows how difficult managing a CDN can be,"" said James Fish, analyst at Piper Sandler & Co.Apart from Fastly, the other main CDN providers include Akamai Technologies, Cloudera and AWS.""It certainly reminds us just how crucial so few sites and services are to our digital lives,"" said Neil Campling, global TMT analyst at Mirabaud Securities.Users received error messages quickly when they visited affected websites on Tuesday, which is an indication Fastly was not a victim of a DDoS attack, or a type of cyber-attack in which a bad actor overwhelms a network with a flood of internet traffic, Champagne said.The United Kingdom's attorney general earlier tweeted that the country's main gov.uk website was down, providing an email for queries.The disruption may have caused issues for citizens booking COVID-19 vaccinations or reporting test results, the Financial Times reported.Websites operated by news outlets including the Financial Times, the Guardian and Bloomberg News also faced outages.Many of the websites affected earn revenue from digital advertising. Worldwide, websites lost over $29 million in digital ad revenue per hour during the outage, according to back-of-the-envelope estimates from media measurement firm Kantar.News publishers came up with inventive workarounds to report about the outage when their websites failed to load.Popular tech website the Verge used Google Docs to report news, while UK Technology Editor at the Guardian started a Twitter thread to report on the problems.At the onset of the outage, nearly 21,000 Reddit users reported issues with the social media platform, while more than 2,000 users reported problems with Amazon, according to Downdetector.com.Twitter users quickly reacted to the outage, creating the #InternetShutdown hashtag with KITKAT's official handle telling its 441,500 followers ""Guess it's time to Have A Break.""""We were offline for a few minutes because the whole internet broke down,"" tweeted Jitse Groen, chief executive of food delivery group Just Eat Takeaway.com.Shares of New York-listed Fastly were up 7.7% after being down nearly 4% in pre-market trading.(Reporting by Subrat Patnaik, Noor Zainab Hussain, Chavi Mehta and Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru, Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm, and Sheila Dang in Dallas; Editing by Patrick Graham, Bernard Orr, Chris Reese and Nick Zieminski)"

"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Tech,,Researchers developed an AI to combat social media disinformation,"Disinformation campaigns are becoming increasingly frequent on social networks, especially in the run-up to elections. Such campaigns are capable of manipulating opinion, reinforcing conspiracy theories or even swaying elections.To counter this new danger, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers have designed an artificial intelligence system capable of identifying fake news with great accuracy.In an effort to fight online disinformation and clean up the internet, a team of MIT researchers have launched a program called ""Reconnaissance of Influence Operations (RIO)."" Their aim was to create a system capable of automatically detecting disinformation and the accounts that spread it. Its success rate is around 96%.The project first originated in 2014, when the team was studying how social media could be exploited by malicious groups. As part of their work, the researchers noticed increased and unusual activity from accounts that appeared to be driving pro-Russian stories. As a result, the team decided to launch the program to study what kind of similar techniques might be used on social media during the 2017 French presidential elections.In the 30 days leading up to the vote, the team compiled 28 million posts from more than one million accounts relating to the election. For example, the study detected a large rate of hostile accounts spreading fake news around the #macronleaks narrative.The team of researchers also looked at the impact of disinformation messages. Using the RIO program, they were able to find out whether an account was contributing to the spread of fake news and what impact this had on the wider network. RIO also has the ability to help predict how different countermeasures might stop the spread of a given disinformation campaign.Hostile online influence operationsEdward Kao, a member of the research team, told MIT News: ""If you are trying to answer the question of who is influential on a social network, traditionally, people look at activity counts. What we found is that, in many cases this is not sufficient. It doesn't actually tell you the impact of the accounts on the social network.""To address this, Kao developed a statistical approach (as outlined in the study) to help determine whether an account is spreading disinformation and the extent to which the account causes the network, as a whole, to change and amplify the message.The RIO system collects relevant data then identifies potential influence operation narratives, and classifies accounts based on their behavior and content. It then builds a narrative network to estimate the impact of these accounts on spreading specific narratives across social media.These hostile online influence operations, as described in the study, are facilitated by the relatively low cost, unbridled scalability and automation of a certain number of variables in the spread of disinformation on social media. It remains to be seen if and how this system can be implemented in order to control the spread of fake news. – AFP/Relaxnews"

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",11:58 PM MYT,Tech,,G7 countries devise way to catch Amazon in tax net - sources,"PARIS (Reuters) - G7 states have found a way to include Amazon, one of the world's biggest companies, on a list of 100 set to face higher taxes in the countries where they do business by targeting its more profitable cloud computing unit, officials close to the talks said.Some European countries had concerns that Amazon may fall out of scope of the proposed new rules because its overall operating margin as a company is less than 10%, which is the threshold set as a criteria for companies on the list.But because its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has a margin of more than 30%, Amazon as a whole can be included, the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.International talks on a global minimum corporate tax which was agreed by the Group of Seven rich countries on June 5. are running in parallel to of talks on how to divide the rights to tax excess profits, those which can be considered routine, of the world's 100 biggest, most profitable companies.G7 finance ministers agreed that governments should get the right to tax at least 20% of profit earned in their country by a multinational, when this profit was over a 10% margin.""We now decided that if a corporation as a whole does not reach the profitability limit, but a large division of it exceeds the G7 thresholds, it must be included,"" a source close to the discussions said.""With this, we're aiming exactly at Amazon,"" the source added.Amazon did not immediately respond to requests to comment.Without singling out Amazon, a British government source familiar with the negotiations said consideration was being given to how the rules would apply to companies that had different activities and business lines.OECD head of tax Pascal Saint-Amans said that Amazon's AWS unit would be liable because it had revenues exceeding a threshold of 20 billion euros ($24.4 billion).""The profits linked to the cloud (business) will thus be shared among countries,"" he told France Info television.($1 = 0.8214 euros)(Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Additional reporting by David Milliken in London; Editing by Alexander Smith)"
"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",1:00 PM MYT,Tech,,"Podcast fans listen to new episodes of their fav shows within a day, study finds","While the podcast market has been booming for over a year, the pandemic has driven many listeners to embrace this kind of audio content.This new appetite for podcasts is particularly good news for advertisers, as their ads appear to be better perceived in podcasts than in other media formats. From the entertaining to the educational, and from the liberated to the activist, podcasts are drawing more and more listeners around the world.Screen-related eye strain has a lot to do with it, according to a new study of more than 3,000 Americans conducted by Spotify and MAGNA. More than 70% of those surveyed said that they experienced screen fatigue during the pandemic.This is something they are fighting against with podcasts. Four out of ten listeners even cited screen fatigue as the primary reason they are listening to more digital audio content.For Gen Zers, podcasts are above all a new way to connect with others during the pandemic. Baby Boomers, however, see them primarily as a way to de-stress. ""There's no doubt the pandemic changed consumption habits and we're clearly seeing audio and podcast listening are extremely popular right now,"" said Kara Manatt, SVP, Intelligence Solutions, MAGNA.A new El Dorado for advertising?The study also revealed that podcast listeners are particularly devoted to the shows they listen to regularly. In fact, 60% of listeners listen to a new episode of their favorite podcast within a day, and 26% within a week. In comparison, 58% of TV viewers watch a new episode of their favorite TV show in the 24 hours following its broadcast.Relistening to podcasts is also becoming increasingly common, mirroring how users often rewatch favorite TV shows. And listener fidelity for podcasts is of keen interest to advertisers, who see an opportunity to revitalize the advertising sector.And rightly so, according to the figures. In the Spotify and MAGNA survey, 43% of respondents said that they're receptive to podcast ads, compared to just 17% who reported being receptive to TV ads. Podcast hosts appear to play a key role in this phenomenon, since the majority of listeners surveyed (84%) trust in the recommendations that they make.""We found it particularly interesting that people are more receptive to ads on audio.

"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,CLARISSA CHUNG,High spikes in registration as vaccinations revved up,"PETALING JAYA: Sign-ups for the Covid-19 jabs among Malaysians have greatly increased, with spikes of over 1,000% in registrations on certain days.However, there is much catching up to do in some states, with less than half of their population having registered.The country saw huge increases in vaccine registration on the days the opt-in AstraZeneca sign-ups went live, according to The Star's analysis of data by the Special Committee on Covid-19 Vaccine Supply Access Guarantee (JKJAV).The first spike took place on May 2, when over 260,000 AstraZeneca vaccines were on offer to residents in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor.There was a sudden, steep increase of 1,007% when vaccine registrations shot up to 254,458 from the 22,969 registrations just the day before.In the seven days prior to the first round of the AstraZeneca opt-in on May 2, the daily average number of vaccine registration was only 28,113.On May 23, daily registrations bumped up by 87.07% from the day before to 130,321 as the second round of AstraZeneca opt-ins opened up at noon that day.It was opened up to those aged 60 and above living in five states namely Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Johor, Sarawak and Penang, with a total of 1.24 million vaccines available.Another spike was later seen on May 25, the day leading up to when the voluntary AstraZeneca programme would be expanded to those aged 18 to 59.Daily registrations surged by 49.74% from the day prior to 219,258 on May 25.On June 11, vaccine registration rates saw another massive bump, from over 200,000 registrations the day before to a whopping 710,477 sign-ups.Universiti Malaya epidemiologist Prof Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud said that for the spikes in May, the opt-in AstraZeneca registration provided a rational explanation.“This means that many people could not wait for their appointments anymore as they are in the lower priority groups so they went for the AstraZeneca opt-in programme.“The government needs to analyse the data to see if there are any duplicate registrations between the opt-in programme and MySejahtera and also perform detailed analysis by age group and locality.“It can then concentrate on the age groups and areas with low registration rates, and find out the reasons for slow registration and devise plans to deal with this, ” he said, adding that the country needs to target about 300,000 to 500,000 daily doses between now and year-end.In about one month and a half between May 1 and June 15, the number of vaccine registrations grew by an encouraging 20.2% to 13.83 million people.The state which saw the largest percentage increase in vaccine sign-ups was Kuala Lumpur, which had grown by 35.9% to 1,168,192 registrations.This is followed by Selangor (23.4% increase to 3,513,960) and Johor (22.5% to 1,727,211).The states with the lowest growth in sign-up rates were Putrajaya (0.6%), Sabah (8.5%) and Kelantan (16%).The more modest increase in sign-ups is not necessarily a cause for concern as the percentage of Putrajaya's population who have signed up for the jabs is 100%.However, it does indicate that more efforts are needed to boost vaccine registration in certain states that are still seeing a low proportion of their population signing up for jabs.For example, as at June 15, only 24.4% of Sabah’s population signed up for their jabs, while Kelantan still has only 42.3% of its people signed up.Compare this to the 86.6% sign-up rate in Kuala Lumpur and 74% in Selangor.Dr Awang Bulgiba said one way to bolster registrations was for the authorities to identify high-risk individuals with comorbidities, instead of just asking people to voluntarily register.“There are several databases, such as health centre records, which can be used to identify them although they are not necessarily comprehensive and may not contain updated addresses.“They can be matched to the nearest vaccination centre and registration forms can be sent to all registered individuals explaining in simple terms why they need to be vaccinated and how they can sign up, ” he said.Dr Awang Bulgiba said all resources such as health clinics, pop-up centres, and mobile teams need to be deployed.“Outreach programmes can also be done to register and maybe even vaccinate people, as is being done in Kelantan, ” he said, adding that mobile vaccination teams can also be sent out to places of worship or community centres.Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Azmi Mohd Tamil said the low registration rates in certain states could be reflective of the states’ infrastructure and socioeconomic status.“Kelantan and Sabah are the states with lower per capita incomes. Since the registration process requires internet access and devices, this could prove a barrier.“To have a smartphone to register is an enormous obstacle for the B40 groups in Sabah and Kelantan. Indirectly IT literacy is also an obstacle, ” he said.He said in Kelantan, there were also certain leaders who spread false information about the vaccines on their social media channels by deeming it “unIslamic”.Dr Azmi said these people must be engaged with and their arguments need to be countered with facts, ""conveyed in a way they could understand"".In Sabah, he said, having documents to show one’s legal citizenship may also be an issue.“Documents such as birth certificates may not be available, perhaps because births are not registered or documents were sold off for money - so they don’t have a MyKad, which is required at vaccination centres for proof of identity.“There are also issues of illegal papers or fake papers in the interiors of Sabah. Besides poverty, Internet access, lack of infrastructure, there are also issues of proper identity documentation in Sabah, ” he said.Dr Azmi said those with illegal papers need to be assured they will not be arrested or deported after registering for the vaccines.“Since we know Internet access and literacy is a barrier, we need to go back to basics. We have to go down to the ground and register people using alternative pathways.“We must rely on the ‘old methods’ of getting them to come to nearby halls and get them vaccinated. Don’t let technology get in the way, ” he said.Even so, Malaysia needs to nearly double the number of its registration in order to achieve herd immunity.The National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme document states that Malaysia aims to vaccinate at least 23.6 million.As of June 15, about 13.83 million people signed up to receive the vaccines, which means that another 9.77 million people need to sign up to reach the target."
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,News,,INTERACTIVE: Letting Go - How Parents of Young Autistic Adults are Teaching Independence,"Letting GoHow Parents of Young Autistic Adults are Teaching IndependenceBY IVY SOONFor individuals with autism, the journey into adulthood is fraught with difficulties.Fortunately for some, they have parents determined to lead them to independence so they can live with purpose and dignity.One day at a time.....Years ago, Zuraidah Khusaimi thought that was how she would face her son Muzaffar’s autism because otherwise , his challenges were simply too overwhelming.In those early difficult days, she struggled to cope with her son’s autism.“I’d give his sisters crayons and they’d colour.""But though the days were long, the years were short.Muzaffar is now 22 and Zuraidah and her husband Ahmad Fairuz Ahmad Seth have long recognised that they needed to prepare Muzaffar for the future.He has come a long way and is now able to take on tasks such as baking muffins from scratch with minimal supervision.Although he still doesn’t take too well to changes in routines and disruptions, Muzaffar is usually calm and amiable, and is able to handle social outings and even travelling.He is verbal though not chatty, and able to engage in conversations and occasionally grumble about his workload and obligations.Muzaffar was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder when he was nine.“At that time, we didn’t know much about autism. It was not a known disorder then,” relates Fairuz, a software engineer.They transferred Muzaffar to a school with integrated special classes, and explored various therapies to help him.He was in a government secondary school until he was 18.“His sisters are aware and involved. They include Muzaffar in their activities and outings.""""They catch movies together and chat about films they like,” says Fairuz who tries to expose Muzaffar to different experiences.Though they worry about Muzaffar’s future well-being, Fairuz and Zuraidah are not placing the responsibility of looking after him solely on their daughters’ shoulders, and are determined to help Muzaffar be self-reliant and independent.“We don’t believe in keeping him hidden at home,” stresses Fairuz who is a certified tennis coach for individuals with special needs.He is training Muzaffar, aiming for him to compete in tennis at the Paralympics.Muzaffar also plays the drums and goes travelling with his family.“As parents, we want the best for our children. We have always focused more on him because he needed more attention,” says Fairuz who has been proactive in seeking ways to equip Muzaffar for independence.Over the years, they have instilled in Muzaffar the importance of work and being self reliant, and their efforts have instilled in their son discipline and diligence.Although there are private companies that offer employment to young adults with special needs, not all understand or have the capacity to create inclusive working environments.There is a need to also train and educate colleagues and the public so there is acceptance and understanding of the complex difficulties individuals with autism might have in communication and social interactions.There is also always the fear of bullying and abuse as individuals with autism lack social understanding and are somewhat naive.“He sold his muffins at a cafe and also at autism events.""""We had orders from family and friends, and it was going well.""""We have sold over 4,000 muffins since 2019. But then, the pandemic hit, and we couldn’t sell at the cafe and at events,” relates Fairuz, who introduces his son as an entrepreneur.With more children diagnosed with autism now, there is an urgent need to scale up services they need, says Assoc Prof Dr Hasnah Toran who hasresearched autism in Malaysia for the past two decades.She is most known for her work at the UKM autism lab and used to head Permata Kurnia, a centre that offers services for those with autism.“We need more child psychiatrists to diagnose autism early so that the children can receive early intervention so they can be school ready.""Government’s health funding goes mostly to tackling heart diseases and cancer, but we need to train more doctors to handle autism. """"There are more services available now but they are sporadic and most parents can’t afford early intervention for their children,” says Dr Hasnah who quit her job as a teacher and took a loan to pursue her doctorate in special education in 2002 after her son was diagnosed with autism.Her son is now 25 and Dr Hasnah is also intent on helping him be more independent.She is working to set up a facility for young adults with autism to live on their own and engage in activities such as urban farming.It’s to prepare them to take care of themselves when their parents are no longer around to look after them.With growing awareness of autism, more parents are sending their children for early intervention. But there is a lack of services or employment opportunities for these children as they become older.The biggest obstacle to them gaining and maintaining jobs is the perception that people with special needs are not capable.People with autism want to be accepted and fully included in the workplace, but need support to get there.Apart from sheltered workshops and vocational training in community college, for now it is very much still up to parents to be proactive on helping their autistic children navigate adulthood.Katherine Ho also deems independent living crucial for her son, Jonathan Chia. When he was young, she enrolled him in a government school with integrated special class and got his father to teach him self help skills.Jonathan Chia working on an acrylic art canvas painting project.“Do not waste the formative years of special needs children. """"They need to learn self help skills and understand concepts like hygiene.""""There are no right or wrong ways of doing things, so don’t make it an issue with your co-parent or teachers.""""The priority is always the child’s well being, so set aside the ego,” shares Ho who quit her career in corporate banking to care for Jonathan after he was diagnosed with autism at 3 1/2 years old.Jonathan is now in his mid-20s and is relatively independent.He has self help skills and social understanding but struggles with expressive speech and “is naive”.“We now want to raise awareness on the urgent needs of young adults with autism,” says Ho who has banded with other parents to set up an NGO and a social enterprise to create opportunities for their children to work and be independent.The NGO, Persatuan Kebajikan Sinar Cahaya Istimewa, is based in Kepong, and runs a sheltered workshop where they do handicraft like beading bracelets and packaging sanitiser kits.During this pandemic the young adults working at Persatuan Kebajikan Sinar Cahaya has switched to packing sanitiser kits to earn income.“Our children went through early intervention and pre-vocational training when they were young, and I don’t want all that to go to waste.""""This is the next step - preparing for adulthood and independence. We believe in future planning and want to help groom him for the next level,” says Ho who also involves Jonathan’s two siblings in his issues so they are aware of his challenges.But she doesn’t want to impose Jonathan’s care on his siblings and is determined to help him be self-reliant.Despite the challenges brought on by thepandemic which has included shutting down their workshop, Ho and other parents are planning to set up a respite care facility for their young adult children.“We want to train our children to live on their own, so we are setting up a house where they can learn to live independently a few days a week, accompanied by a chaperon and caregiver. There will be a kitchen where they can learn to prepare meals too.“It’s all part of the planning for their future. As parents, we also have to gradually let go,” says Ho.Story: Ivy SoonIllustration: Foo Chern HwanVideo: Shaiful Rizwan Mohd AzharVisualisation and Editing: Sim Leoi LeoiTOPBuilt with Shorthand"

"Thursday, 10 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,RAZAK AHMAD，DIYANA PFORDTEN,INTERACTIVE: How sporadic Covid-19 infections became the norm in Malaysia,"PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is fighting its deadliest Covid-19 outbreak since the start of the pandemic amid growing concern about sporadic cases that have come to dominate infections in the country.Sporadic or unlinked transmissions refer to cases that cannot be linked to any cluster. A sharp rise is worrying since it shows that the coronavirus is becoming more entrenched.Many cases recorded in Malaysia used to be linked to clusters, but the situation has changed.Over the past 10 weeks, the percentage of sporadic cases has shot up from 52% in late March to 84.3% in early June, according to the Health Ministry.The number of people who died from a sporadic infection has also surged.An analysis done by The Star found that nearly seven out of 10 infections recorded since the start of the country’s third wave on Sept 20 last year were not directly attributed to a cluster – a possible reflection of a high number of sporadic cases.The analysis was done by counting the number of cases in each of the four broad categories the ministry uses to classify every single infection.Of the 600,407 cases recorded from Sept 20 to June 5, only 32.4% (194,488) were classified as cluster cases. The remaining 67.6% (405,919 cases) fell into the three other categories:A breakdown of the ministry’s figures shows that Selangor has the highest number of cases that were not attributed to clusters (147,250) for the Sept 20 to June 5 period, followed by Sabah (46,629) and Kuala Lumpur (41,334).""This situation is very worrying, because the majority of new Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 deaths are from sporadic cases,"" Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said in a post on his Facebook page on June 7.He said one factor which is contributing to the trend is the emergence of new, more transmissible and deadly coronavirus variants in the community.As at May 31 this year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has listed four new Variants of Concern (VOC) and six Variants of Interest (VOI).A VOC is a variant of the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus that shows an ability to spread faster, or is more virulent, or which lessens the effectiveness of vaccines.A VOI is a variant suspected to either be more contagious than the original, or causes a more severe infection, or is able escape the protection offered by vaccines. A VOI can become a VOC if more evidence emerges that it does one or more of those things.As at June 4, 2021, a total of 138 infections in Malaysia has been detected from three of the VOCs and three VOIs, including in sporadic cases.Of the 138 infections cause by the new variants, 63 cases (45.7%) were identified as sporadic cases.Sporadic cases identified from close contact screenings were the biggest single source of infections by the Beta (B.1.351) variant, making up 32 of the 104 cases found so far in Malaysia.Malaysia Medical Association president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said poor compliance to the standard operating procedure (SOP), added to unidentified or untested close contacts in earlier Covid-19 cases, may have led to the high number of sporadic cases.""A significant number of cases are asymptomatic and therefore, with poor SOP compliance when travelling or at the workplace, many would have been unknowingly spread or got infected.""Over time, the source or index cases would be untraceable or unlinkable,"" he said.While Dr Subramaniam encouraged more extensive contact tracing, he acknowledged the fact that the government's limited manpower and resources may hinder such measures.""It should also be noted that some people don't use mobile phones but write their names down when registering at restaurants and shops.""We aren't sure if they are being called and informed in the event there is an outbreak of infections,"" he said, noting that while some may be casual contacts that may not require a swab test, others could unknowingly be under the close contact category.Dr Subramaniam questioned whether those without mobile phones are all truthfully filling out their names and contact details.Apart from speeding up vaccinations, he said the current lockdown should be used as an opportunity to do mass testing.This would help authorities speed up the process of identifying and isolating people who are infected, in line with the WHO's Find Test Trace Isolate and Support (FTTIS) system.""Individually, we must ensure strict discipline in observing the SOP and avoid or limit contact with people outside the household,"" he said.Dr Subramaniam said the government should consider prioritising vaccinations for the 1.57 million people allowed to be present at work during the lockdown.Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman also agreed that that SOP violations were likely the main contributor to the spread of unlinked Covid-19 cases.She added that in a situation where most individuals do not seriously practise preventive measures, it would be easy for the virus to be transmitted from one person to another.Dr Malina said the higher transmissibility of new variants may also be a reason why the number of sporadic cases is going up.When the third wave started on Sept 20 last year, clusters made up 84.6% of daily cases. By June 1 this year, the figure had fallen to just 14.6%.She said everyone needs to continue practising all recommended public health measures such as washing their hands regularly, wearing masks or double masking, and physical distancing.""We need to treat other persons who are not family members who stay in the same house as 'positive' until proven otherwise,"" she said, as she advocated for individuals getting vaccinated as scheduled and to practise self-lockdown.Universiti Malaya epidemiologist Prof Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud said the fastest way to tackle the rising number of unlinked infections is to have a total lockdown for two to three months.""It would mean infections would be confined to just family members and not spread outside the family.""Having a lockdown with lots of movement and contact between people means unlinked cases will continue to spread,"" he said, adding that vaccination of the community needs to be ramped up so that Covid-19 transmissions can be stopped through herd immunity.Dr Awang Bulgiba said while some may advocate mass testing, it needs to be extensive, done quickly and followed by vaccination to be effective.He urged the government to speed up and combine epidemiological analysis with genomic surveillance to understand the characteristics of newer variants of Covid-19 present in the community.""If they are different from the ones in 2020, for example, if they affect children more and are more virulent in children, we need to consider vaccinating children too,"" he said.Noting that those below 18 years of age will need to be vaccinated to achieve vaccination for 80% of the population, Dr Awang Bulgiba highlighted that the United States has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 to 18.He said that without faster vaccination rates, the reduction in sporadic cases after two or three months of a strict lockdown may only be temporary.""If we vaccinate people at an average rate of 300,000 jabs per day, we can cover 80% of the population within the next six months.""Once this is reached, we should have herd immunity – barring any new variants,"" he said, adding that a sustained reduction in sporadic infections could be seen when about half of the population is vaccinated."
"Wednesday, 09 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,News,RAZAK AHMAD，DIYANA PFORDTEN,INTERACTIVE: Here’s what vaccinating Malaysian children against Covid-19 could involve,"PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is expected to announce its decision soon on whether children should be included in the country’s Covid-19 immunisation programme.The current plan currently only covers those aged 18 and above, but a growing number of other countries have already started to vaccinate children.The government is currently studying whether Malaysia should follow suit. If the country were to decide to vaccinate its children, what would it involve?According to the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme document, Malaysia currently aims to vaccinate at least 23.6 million people aged 18 and above.Calculations based on the most recent available figures show that vaccinating children aged 12 and above, as several other countries have done, would raise the number vaccinated to at least 26.25 million people.With Malaysia's population currently estimated at 32.77 million according to the Statistic Department's online population clock (www.dosm.gov.my), vaccinating 12- to 17-year-olds could, in theory, help Malaysia reach 80% vaccine coverage.A population vaccination coverage of 80% is often mentioned by experts as a minimum estimate for a country to achieve herd immunity from Covid-19, though there is no exact figure.“Although no one is certain of the percentage of the population required to be vaccinated before we can hinder the spread of Covid-19 in the community, we do know that this will be difficult without vaccinating children,” senior consultant pediatrician Datuk Dr Amar Singh HSS wrote in an article published by the MySinChew news portal.More than three million children in Malaysia aged between 12 and 17 would get vaccinated if the government decides to include the age group.According to the Children Statistics 2020 report, there were an estimated 2.65 million children who are aged 13-17 as of last year (2020).Those aged 7-12 meanwhile total 3.01 million, according to the report released by the department.Selangor had the biggest number of 13- to 17-year-olds as of last year, with about 475,800 followed by Sabah (374,500), Johor (303,400), Sarawak (246,100) and Perak (202,600).Among the countries which have reportedly begun vaccinating children or have approved jabs for children 12 and above are Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, Britain and the United States."

Sunlight gives you the chance to play around with shadows and highlights without needing to fuss over colour correction.The OPPO Find X3 Pro is also equipped with AI Highlight Video that automatically switches between Ultra-Night Video and Live HDR, allowing you to capture true-to-life colours without worrying about low-light or overexposure.Not to mention the Find X3 Pro is capable of 10-bit colour which is ground-breaking in itself ensuring absolute and real colours, making the Find X3 Pro a convenient tool for professional photography.Use the ‘rule of thirds’Don’t worry, this isn’t as complicated as it sounds. Simply put, this just means that when the subject of your photo is framed in the intersections of your composition, it will turn out more visually appealing than the traditionally centred shot.With the Find X3 Pro world first’s 50MP ultra wide-angle, you can capture even more details in a single instance, allowing more flexibility with your shots with zero distortion. You can use this to your advantage by using different perspectives to make your photos unique.Shoot many, keep a fewLastly, be prepared to take a lot of photos. Some of the best results come from candid moments when your model may be laughing or smiling. Those are the photos that bring out the humanity in mundane moments.Capturing their gaze can really add life to the overall photo and allow the subjects to tell their own story through the shot.Preserve today, for tomorrow, in your photos.

"Monday, 14 Jun 2021",8:30 AM MYT,StarPicks,,Transforming careers for the digital age,"GA Malaysia equips individuals with in-demand digital skillsABOUT a quarter of all Malaysian jobs are expected to be displaced by 2030 due to digitalisation.The pandemic has accelerated the pace of change. Even as overall unemployment rises, the number of digital job vacancies has tripled in the past year, according to the Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC).Few careers will be left untouched by the rising demand for digital skill sets such as data science, digital marketing, product management, user experience design and more.Forward-looking professionals are racing to adapt by investing in digital skills development to remain relevant and continue progressing in their careers.Getting aheadGeneral Assembly (GA), a global pioneer in skills and career transformation, specialises in equipping individuals with today’s most in-demand skills.More than 100,000 GA graduates are employed at 19,000 organisations globally. GA is the number one provider of digital upskilling bootcamps in the United States.According to GA Malaysia CEO Andrew Pereira, professionals are looking for practical digital skills development with credentials that will advance their careers.“They want to learn immediately applicable skills from experts and earn a globally recognised qualification in the process, without an excessive time commitment,” he says.However, many only turn their mind to upskilling or reskilling when they are out of a job or unable to move up the corporate ladder.“Most skills have a shelf life. You need to be constantly restocking with fresh skills or you may find that the ones you have are outdated,” says Pereira.Many of today’s most in-demand skills such as Python (a coding language commonly used in data science) and data visualisation are not even widely recognised.“The business world is moving beyond just spreadsheets and slides. We are there to help professionals discover and develop skills to help them get ahead,” he says.Securing a jobThis need is even more pronounced among recent graduates and early career professionals. They have been disproportionately impacted by today’s tighter labour market as evidenced by the high graduate unemployment rate.“A lot of university graduates turn to us several months into their job search because they discover that their degrees and skill sets don’t match what employers are looking for,” says Pereira.“We have helped many change careers entirely – for instance, helping arts graduates secure data analyst or digital marketing roles.”According to GA’s most recent audited Student Outcomes Report, 91% of GA’s reskilling students secure a position in their new digital field within 180 days of graduation. That figure rises to over 99% after 180 days.Pereira attributes this success to the high quality of instruction and career coaching that GA provides.“We accept fewer than 10% of applicants for instructor roles and practice project-based learning.”MySTEP to learn digital skillsGeneral Assembly is partnering with Khazanah Nasional to deliver the MySTEP programme 2021 to support unemployed Malaysians.The four-month programme upskills learners in in-demand digital skills, offers globally-recognised certification, develops learners’ professional skills, and matches learners with career opportunities.Learners also earn RM 2,000 per month during the programme, so that they can focus on learning digital skills, developing professional skills, and on securing job opportunities in digital areas such as software engineering, data analytics, digital marketing and more.While joining the MySTEP programme 2021 is free, seats are limited and over 2,000 have applied for the programme within its first month. Applications for the programme can be made online by July 12.For more information on the programme, visit the website."
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",9:15 AM MYT,StarPicks,,Want to know how to pursue UK higher education during a pandemic?,"UNDERSTANDABLY, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, parents are concerned about increased health and safety risks when sending their children overseas to further their education.According to the Higher Education Ministry’s statistics, 73,000 Malaysian students were studying abroad in 2019, with the majority seeking their education in the United Kingdom and Ireland (26.4%). But the numbers dropped significantly to 39,882 in 2020.However, there may be a workaround that might prove beneficial so that students can benefit from an international education, while staying safe on home ground.Those keen to pursue higher studies in the UK, in particular, can take a look at the international branch of the University of Reading, the University of Reading Malaysia (UoRM), which offers a number of flexible pathways and options.Ranked 75 in the world for international outlook in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020, the University of Reading boasts several world-renowned centres of academic excellence, including the Henley Business School, the School of Built Environment, the School of Law, as well as the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences.Flexible possibilitiesAt UoRM, students are able to start their studies locally and take advantage of its flexible mobility programme. This transfer option would allow students to complete their studies at the university’s UK campus in Reading, once international travel regulations are better hammered out.Furthermore, studying at the local campus proves to be more affordable, with the overall estimated cost costing 40% less than studying three years in the UK, taking into account university fees and living expenses.On top of that, students may be eligible to receive a merit-based High Achievers Scholarship worth up to 30% off their programme fees.The programmes at UoRM are identical to those on the UK campus, following the same curriculum and academic quality standards. Furthermore, UoRM’s state-of-the-art campus and digital learning suite will also provide students with excellent learning facilities and support.The local campus is located in EduCity Iskandar Johor - touted as Asia’s first multi-campus education city - and offers a number of signature degree programmes in the following disciplines:> Accounting> Finance> Management and business> Law> Psychology> Quantity surveying> Real estateWhen students do eventually make their way to the UK, they would be pleased to note that the university’s main campus in the UK is set in 130ha of beautiful parkland and has won the Green Flag award nine times in a row, making it one of the UK’s best green spaces. It is also equipped with sports facilities, eateries, a supermarket and on-campus accommodation.A bonus? The campus is just a short bus ride away from Reading town centre. With ample shops, restaurants and amenities, it happens to be a 22-minute train ride to London.Flexible commencementStudents with A-level, STPM, UEC or equivalent qualifications may apply for UoRM undergraduate degrees, while those with SPM or IGCSE qualifications may enrol in the 12-month International Foundation Programme.Upon successful progression, students may take on their undergraduate studies either in the Malaysian or UK campus. In the meantime, the local campus has three different commencement periods - April, July and September – to give students further flexibility.The faculty is also expanding and accepting new faculty members who might be interested in joining the local campus.

Instead of writing the essay, he wrote just one sentence – that he wanted me to come home.“That one sentence broke my heart as I saw how much being away from each other had affected him,” he added.Another Malaysian father working in Singapore, Teow Yee Han, 30, is resigned to spending his first Father’s Day without his nine-month-old daughter, who was born in Kedah on Sept 20 last year.“My wife and I returned to our hometown about a month before our baby was due and stayed there until she was about five months old.“In February, we had to be back for work.

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,News,STEPHANIE LEE,Overcoming poverty the hard way,"KOTA KINABALU: When Catherine Dumas was growing up, all she knew of the world was the forest she was born in. Today, the Sabahan is a self-made millionaire running her own packaging business.It was deep in the forest of Tamparuli, some 50km from the state capital, that Dumas learnt the ways of the village, sourcing for food like fruits, vegetables and fish from her parents’ farm and the nearby river.She recalled walking to school for hours each day with her siblings because the family had no car and there were no roads there either during that time.“We had to leave at 4am to make it to school,” said the 41-year-old founder of the company Qpack.The seventh of eight siblings also remembered having to wear home clothes and slippers on their journey to school and change just before reaching school.“We had to walk through the forest, up and down hills, cross a river, and if we had worn our uniforms from home, we would be drenched in sweat and dirt,” she said.Although her family lived in a simple wooden house without electricity and tap water, Dumas said she was unaware of what poverty was back then.“I only realised it when I went to secondary school and lived in a hostel. My friends had pocket money to buy snacks and their parents arrived in cars during the weekends to visit,” she said.She rued the time when she felt embarrassed to see her parents coming to visit her on foot and bringing a little bit of what they had from home and some money from their sales at the weekly tamu (market).“I even told my mother to stop visiting and that she didn’t have to give me money because I was so embarrassed. What an ungrateful child I was!” she said.But the tough 14-year-old did not wallow in self-pity. Instead, she started working part-time during the weekends, pocketing between RM20 and RM30 weekly from cleaning her teachers’ houses to washing dishes in restaurants.“As I grew older, I realised how difficult it was for my parents to raise eight of us with just farming. I knew I had to study hard to transform our lives,” said Dumas, who eventually made it to university.After graduating, she worked with audit firms, among others, and did part-time door-to-door sales.“I struggled for about 10 years to make ends meet,” she said.It was only in 2018 that Dumas had an idea which led her to become a successful entrepreneur.“I saw how small-time traders, especially home businesses, packaged their goods, so I thought if I could help them improve their packaging then they might increase their sales,” she said.From there, Dumas gradually built her team and business to be what it is now – a RM15mil venture with a 25-strong workforce and many trainees and agents under her.“When the pandemic hit last year, we had to improvise fast and adapt to online marketing,” she said.The mother of three is now able to make life better for her parents by giving them a monthly allowance as well as helping her siblings whenever they need financial support.Her only regret is not being able to do so much earlier, and to bring happiness to her parents, especially her mother, now in her 80s, who is battling stage-four cancer.“I will do my best to make her happy,” said Dumas."

I normally bring him along if I have to go out, ” he admits.As for another single father, Tan Poh Choong, 64, the pandemic has strengthened his bond with his two sons, aged 19 and 12 respectively.“We spent a lot of time together during this MCO and I’m thankful for that.“My two sons are my source of courage and strength during moments when we were lonely and scared, ” says Tan, who has sole custody of the boys since his divorce with his wife seven years ago.As a former chief executive officer of an asset management company, some of Tan’s leadership skills got humorously translated into their home life during the MCO.“During the pandemic, I have had more time to monitor my boys and I could tell them to make their beds.“I could see their ethics at home, ” laughs Tan, adding that to be fair, the boys also got to know more of his habits too.Labelling fatherhood as “a sweet burden”, he says many parents believe they sacrificed for their children but he disagrees with that notion.“You don’t sacrifice for your children but you step up for them.“As a single parent, things can be overwhelming but my children have given me back love and protected my sanity.“And that sustains me. It’s a joy when they are around me and they give me purpose, ” Tan adds."

Most of those affected are people earning unfixed income such as odd-job labourers and stall operators who do not have permission to operate during the lockdown.“When we started delivering the food baskets, we met so many people who were struggling financially. Some do not even have the means to secure their next meal.“There are so many people who have fallen on hard times. It makes us reflect on how fortunate our situation is compared to them,” said Husna, who runs an online business.The target recipients for the KT Food Basket initiative were those working in the informal sector, daily wage earners, as well as families with sick or frail senior members or special needs children.Husna said she was touched to see how generous Malaysians were to those in need, adding that some members of the public even donated expensive milk for disabled recipients under the project.“We are so grateful that there are so many generous people out there who also trust us to do this,” she added.As the lockdown has been extended until June 28 and they still had some extra funds from public donations, Husna said they would be continuing with another round of the food baskets.“We learnt that doing groundwork is very tiring but we have to go on. There’s still no sign of when this pandemic will end,” she said, adding that it had been heartbreaking to witness so many people suffering financially.“What I would like to say to other fellow Malaysians is hang in there and keep helping each other, regardless of race or religion,” she said."

It was a bit of a shock at first when I was confirmed positive on May 12.‘’I was informed that the infection involved contacts while on duty.“I did ask the doctor several times just to reconfirm it. In the end, the answer remained the same, and I had to be placed at the Covid-19 Quarantine and Low-Risk Treatment Centre (PKRC),” she said.Nur Fazlizai, 34, recalled that it was a really difficult experience for her as she boarded a van from the Health Ministry to the PKRC at Universiti Teknologi Mara Chendering branch on the eve of Hari Raya Aidilfitri, as takbir Raya played on the radio.“I was really sad and scared. I couldn’t describe my feelings at that time but I prayed that the vaccine I had received before would be able to get me through this.“What I was worried about most was other people. Out of 30 close contacts, two of them were infected. Thankfully, they didn’t have severe symptoms,” she said.When asked if she had any doubts or regrets as she was still infected despite having been vaccinated, she said: “Of course not. If compared to other patients who have not received the vaccine, I am actually very fortunate.”Nur Fazlizai also said at the PKRC, many patients suffered severe cough, fever and loss of smell but as she was asymptomatic, she could do various things, including filing news stories.Sharing similar sentiments on the importance of taking the vaccine was Zaid Salim who also did not experience any symptoms.Zaid, who is a 50-year-old stringer with a newspaper company, received the vaccine on May 11.He tested positive three days later and was admitted to the same PKRC.“I was infected while doing coverage and did not know that some of those present were positive.“However, I did not suffer any health problems. Out of 40 of my close contacts, no one tested positive, including my family members,” said Zaid, who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.As he had tested positive, the second dose, which was supposed to be administered on June 14 had to be postponed.Both Nur Fazlizai and Zaid urged those selected to receive the jabs not to miss the opportunity to get vaccinated, as it not only protects them but also others. — Bernama"

But the herd did not accept it,” he said, adding that Wildlife Rescue Unit (WRU) rangers were later called to help.He said the rejection by the herd could be due to several reasons.The herd did not acknowledge the calf or it had been away from other elephant groups for too long, he said.Another possibility was that there was too much human scent on the calf as it has been in close proximity with humans, he added.Nevertheless, Dr Sen said the calf will meet new elephants to call them family soon, as it has been taken to the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre.In his Facebook post, he said the calf, apart from being confused, was bright, alert and responsive.Dr Sen said rangers had tried to feed it with milk but it did not want to drink, as it was not familiar with the flavour.“It, however, drank lots of water and ate banana trunks,” he said, adding the calf has been named Yuri.He said Yuri had minor skin injuries on the left forelimbs and front head.He expressed his thanks to the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, Malaysian Palm Oil Green Conservation Foundation, Orangutan Appeal UK and Oregon Zoo for funding all the wildlife operations that the wildlife rescue unit had conducted."

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,News,ANIS FARID AND，ABINAYA MOHAN,"Paternity leave, the best Father’s Day gift","IN a time where fathers want to be more involved in their children’s lives, Father's Day is an opportunity to reflect on our current paternity leave policies. Do we as a society understand a father’s role and involvement in early childhood? Are we practicing gender equality?Paternity leave matters because it makes it clear that caregiving is a shared responsibility, helping decrease the gender pay gap and allowing fathers to be actively involved in raising their children.In Malaysia, fathers in the public sector enjoy seven days of leave to welcome and bond with their newborn, whilst those in the private sector are not entitled to any leave at all. In the now delayed commitment to amend the Employment Act of 1955, the Human Resources Ministry proposed a total of three days paternity leave for the private sector. This is simply not enough.Most fathers value hands-on parenting.Benny, a sustainability professional, has enjoyed this process: “From the very beginning until now, I’m still very much helping with the night sessions of feeding and changing diapers. It’s a tag team effort of a husband and wife to raise children.”New dad Jo Fan, whose son was born a few days before the first movement control order, says working from home allowed him “to witness all the first milestones.”The past year, being in a pandemic and several MCOs, has provided insight into why paternity leave is urgent and necessary for both parents.Jo Fan believes being at home allowed him to better support his wife, which is crucial, especially as first time parents, “because it’s a period of high stress.”As difficult as the pandemic may be, WFH has granted this unique opportunity and allowed fathers to contribute more. Studies based in the UK have found that, following the first Covid-19 lockdown, there was a 58% increase in childcare undertaken by men. In 2020, men were spending 64% of the time that women spent on childcare, compared to 39% in 2015. Farihah and her spouse, who welcomed their second child last year, speak to how caregiving was now more equally split compared to their experience with their eldest.Paternity leave is also positive for mothers. In a survey conducted by Women’s Aid Organisation (WAO) and Vase.ai, 55% of women felt their partners had insufficient paternity leave. This negatively affected their health, and 65% of these women said that it also impacted their child and family. Introducing a seven day paternity leave could alleviate these stressors.Additionally, women in Malaysia were hardest hit during the pandemic, with many leaving their jobs because of the double burden of caregiving and working. We also have one of the lowest labour force participation rates for women in Southeast Asia. Paternity leave helps bridge this gap as the World Bank data shows women are more likely to participate in the labour market with paid paternity leave – and obviously, the longer the better.Farihah can attest to this, having interviewed for and starting a new job late last year, thanks to the support of her husband who was working from home and leading on caregiving.Spending quality time with a new born and supporting their partners should be a father’s right. Currently, Malaysia lags behind its neighbours in paternity leave days. The Philippines allows 14 days leave, whilst Indonesia entitles its fathers to a month if they are public servants and two days paid leave in the private sector. Vietnam also allows between 5-14 days of paternity leave.Even with the proposed three day paternity leave provision, many parents still feel this is insufficient. For Benny and for Farihah, the ideal paternity leave would be three months, or what is often referred to as the fourth trimester. But, for a start, seven days would help many families.Welcoming a new baby into the family is an exciting experience for parents but they also need time to adjust and a longer paternity leave lets both parents figure out a routine that works. It is also a practical approach, as Farihah points out, it helps ease the process of sorting out post-birth matters, including birth registration and immediate check-ups for babies.As we move towards recovery and reopening, fathers will soon return to work. It’s imperative we begin reconsidering our paternity leave policies. This is not just about fathers – it’s about families. In this, we urge Parliament to re-open to pass the Employment Act and grant fathers at least 7 days of paternity leave. This Father's Day, as we reflect on the role we want dads to play, this amendment is a good step towards a more equal society. As Farihah says, “If we orient our society towards prioritising family-friendly policies, we’ll all be better for it.”Anis Farid is the Women’s Aid Organisation’s research and advocacy officer while Abinaya Mohan is WAO’s head of campaigns.

We want to set an example to the villagers.“There are some villagers who run away when the mobile clinic arrives. Sometimes parents take their children to the river or near the sea because they are afraid they will fall ill if they get vaccinated.“So I thought it was better for me to go. After I return to the village, I can tell my villagers that I don’t feel any pain. Some of them tried to persuade me not to go, but I came anyway,” he said.Nengkak was among 60 Orang Asli, 27 of whom are village chiefs, who received the Covid-19 vaccine at the hospital yesterday.Another tok batin, Ilan Johos, said his villagers at Kampung Orang Asli Broga in Semenyih were also fearful of getting vaccinated.“When I met the villagers and told them about registering with the Orang Asli Development Department (Jakoa) for vaccination, they declined, saying that they had read on Facebook that there were people who had died and all sorts of stories.“I told them that if I get vaccinated and I die here, then they do not need to get the jab. But if I do get the jab and I return home, then my villagers should all get the jab.“I am the first person in my village to get vaccinated,” said the 57-year-old.He said no person in any part of Malaysia was safe from the virus without vaccination.“Yes, (the Orang Asli) live in the village and perhaps last time we could rely on forest produce to survive, but now we can’t.“We go out to work at the factories and do other kinds of jobs. The young people who go out to work could bring the virus back to the village; that’s why the disease is spreading,” he said.Andak Pendek, tok batin at the Kuala Pangsun village, said the injection felt like an “ant bite” and the process was fast.He was also getting vaccinated to show his people back home that there was nothing to fear.“In our village, a lot of people are influenced by information on WhatsApp that claims vaccines are dangerous to the community, especially those who are elderly and with other health problems.“But no matter what, it is still necessary for me to take the vaccine because I regularly go out to the town or market to buy things,” he said."

The decision will be made by the JKJAV (COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Access Guarantee Special Committee) if the second dose must be given sooner,” he said in a news conference at his office here, on Saturday (June 19).Currently, the interval for the AstraZeneca vaccine is 12 weeks or three months.Meanwhile, he said the government would study reports from the country’s health expert and Australian health authority after the country stopped administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to individuals aged below 60, following concern that the vaccine was linked to blood clot cases among the group.Dr Adham said this was especially on the supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced by suppliers from Thailand which would arrive in July.""Our experts will re-evaluate whether the AstraZeneca vaccine is suitable for those aged 60 and below,” he said.Malaysia had procured the Covid-19 vaccine produced by AstraZeneca through the Covax facility and directly from the manufacturer.Dr Adham said so far, the overall data showed that the AstraZeneca vaccine did not cause serious harm to recipients in Malaysia.Commenting on the first dose strategy, he said the government has no plan to implement such a strategy because the vaccine supply ordered was sufficient for the people in this country.Through the strategy, the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine is given to more people by extending the interval for the second dose. The strategy has been implemented by countries such as the United Kingdom and Germany.In a related development, Dr Adham said the government was implementing the ""vaccinate first, register later"" method for those who are having difficulties registering for vaccination, especial in the rural areas.This was done by activating the mobile team to track down the target groups that were supposed to get the vaccine in the second phase of the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.""We are targeting to inoculate 9.4 million people in the second phase but so far, only 4.4 million have registered via the MySejahtera app. So, we are going all out to deploy the team to cover all recipients, before we can proceed with the third phase,” he said.The second phase of the immunisation programme focuses on senior citizens, persons with disabilities and those with chronic illnesses.Meanwhile, Dr Adham said those who have been vaccinated must continue to practise public health action so that the risk of infection could be contained effectively.""There is still a probability for those who have been vaccinated to be infected with Covid-19 as the virus has been in the community. We need to continue practising new norms such as wearing face masks, washing hands frequently, observing physical distance and avoiding crowded places and direct contact with others,” he said.He added that Covid-19 vaccination serves to protect recipients from getting a serious infection, hence, the government through the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) would ensure that whatever vaccines that are being used have been confirmed safe, effective and of high quality.Dr Adham said the government was in the midst of formulating a strategy to inoculate individuals aged between 12 and 17, totalling 3.5 million people, following the approval to administer the Comirnaty vaccine produced by Pfizer-BioNTech to the group.- Bernama"

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.“After all units are put into operation, the power supply in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area will be further safeguarded,” Yang told Xinhua.Coal burning contributes up to 70 per cent of carbon in Yangtze River sediment, study findsThe station will generate an average of 38.9 billion kilowatt hours of electricity a year after it goes into full operation, the equivalent of burning 12.2 million tonnes of coal – or enough to save 30.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the state broadcaster CCTV. One day’s output alone would be enough to meet the energy needs of 300,000 people for a year.Since the first batch of power units started running last June, the station has produced 24 billion KWH, enough for a city of 8.5 million people for eight months, CCTV added.The 120 billion yuan (US$18.7 billion) dam spans the Jinsha River, the name given to the upper stretches of the Yangtze, near the border between Yunnan and Sichuan provinces.In 2015 before construction started, geologists and water scientists voiced concerns that building a dam in earthquake-prone Wudongde was risky and the dams would damage the ecology of the lower stretches of the Yangtze.The Wudongde dam, which has a total storage capacity of 7.4 billion cubic meters, equivalent to nearly 3 million Olympic-sized swimming pools, is also designed to control floods and make river transport easier.Its maximum flood discharge can reach 37,000 cubic metres a second, enough to fill Hangzhou’s celebrated West Lake in just seven minutes.Will a new law bring China’s dying Yangtze River back to life?The dam is the first in a chain of four along the downstream section of the Jinsha, while the Yangtze proper is home to the Three Gorges Dam, now the world’s biggest hydropower project in terms of installed capacity.Last year the Three Gorges generated 111.8 billion KWH of electricity, breaking a record previously held by the Itaipu Dam on the border of Brazil and Paraguay, according to national trade association the China Electricity Council.More from South China Morning Post:China’s dam rush: critics query hydropower path to carbon neutralityHow China built the world’s largest arch dam in just four yearsFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,News,JEFFREY D. SACHS,We don’t need any more useless G-7 summits,"THE latest Group of 7 summit was a waste of resources. If it had to be held at all, it should have been conducted online, saving time, logistical costs and airplane emissions. But, more fundamentally, G-7 summits are an anachronism.There was absolutely nothing at the G-7summit that could not have been accomplished much more cheaply, easily and routinely by Zoom. Online international meetings by politicians, parliamentarians, scientists and activists are important. They normalise international discussions.But why should those discussions occur within the G-7, which has been superseded by the Group of 20? When the G-7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Britain and the United States) began their annual summit meetings in the 1970s, they still dominated the world economy. In 1980, they constituted 51% of world’s gross domestic product (measured at international prices), whereas the developing countries of Asia accounted for just 8.8%. In 2021, the G-7 countries produce a mere 31% of world GDP, while the same Asian countries produce 32.9%.The G-20, by including China, India, Indonesia and other large developing countries, represents around 81% of world output, and balances the interests of its high-income and developing economies. It is not perfect, as it leaves out smaller and poorer countries and should add the African Union as a member, but at least the G-20 offers a fruitful format for discussing global topics covering most of the world economy.The G-7 is particularly irrelevant because its leaders don’t deliver on their promises. They like making symbolic statements, not solving problems. Worse, they give the appearance of solving global problems, while really leaving them to fester. This year’s summit was no different.Consider Covid-19 vaccines. The G-7 leaders set the goal of vaccinating at least 60% of the global population. They also pledged to share 870 million doses directly over the next year, presumably meaning enough for 435 million fully immunised individuals (with two doses per person). But 60% of the global population comes to 4.7 billion people, or roughly 10 times that number.The G-7 leaders offered no plan for achieving their stated aim of global coverage, and in fact, have not developed one, even though it would not be hard to do. Estimating the monthly production of every Covid-19 vaccine is straightforward, and allocating those doses fairly and efficiently to all countries is entirely feasible.One reason such a plan has not yet been developed is that the US government so far refuses to sit down with Russian and Chinese leaders to devise such a global allocation. Another reason is that the G-7 governments let the vaccine manufacturers negotiate privately and secretly, rather than as part of a global plan. Perhaps a third reason is that the G-7 looked at global targets without thinking hard enough about the needs of each recipient country.Yet another example of the G-7’s false promises is climate change. At the latest summit, G-7 leaders rightly embraced the goal of global decarbonisation by 2050 and called on developing countries to do so as well. They reiterated a financial pledge first made in 2009 that was never fulfilled: “We reaffirm the collective developed country goal to jointly mobilise US$100bil per year from public and private sources, through to 2025.”The rich countries missed their own deadline of 2020 for providing the long-promised US$100bil per year – a mere 0.2% of rich countries’ annual GDP. And the promised US$100bil is itself a small fraction of what developing countries need for decarbonisation and climate adaptation.The disconnect between the G-7’s soaring aims and meager means is apparent on education as well. Hundreds of millions of children in poor countries lack access to primary and secondary education because their governments don’t have the financial means to provide teachers, classrooms and supplies.In 2020, Unesco estimated that the low- and lower-middle-income countries need around US$504bil per year up to 2030 to ensurethat all kids complete a secondary education. But they have only around $356 billion of their own domestic resources, leaving a financing gap of around US$148bil per year.Yet the G-7 leaders propose “a target to get 40 million more girls into education and with at least $2.75 billion for the Global Partnership for Education.” These are not serious numbers. They are pulled out of thin air and would leave hundreds of millions of children out of school. Large-scale solutions are available – such as mobilising low-interest financing from multilateral development banks – but the G-7 leaders didn’t propose such solutions.The world’s problems are far too urgent to leave to empty posturing and to measures that are a mere token of what is needed. If politics were a mere spectator sport, to be judged by which politicians mugged for the cameras best, the G-7 summit would perhaps have a role to play. But we have urgent global needs to meet.My recommendations: fewer face-to-face meetings, more serious homework to link means and ends, more routine Zoom meetings to discuss what really needs to be done and greater reliance on the G-20 (plus the African Union) as the group that can actually follow through. We need Asia, Africa and Latin America at the table for any true global problem solving. — LosAngeles Times/TNSJeffrey D.

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Novavax Covid-19 vaccine over 90% effective,"Novavax's Covid-19 jab is more than 90% effective, including against coronavirus variants, the vaccine maker said on June 14 (2021) after a large-scale study.The jab “demonstrated 100% protection against moderate and severe disease, 90.4% efficacy overall”, the company said in a statement.It added that “the study enrolled 29,960 participants across 119 sites in the United States and Mexico to evaluate efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.”The US-based company said it intended to apply for regulatory approval by the third quarter of this year (2021).After that, it said, it would be on course to make 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter and 150 million doses per month by the end of the year.While some rich countries have made progress on vaccinating their populations, there remain concerns that many poorer countries are being left out of the global inoculation drive.Vaccination rates in the world’s poorest nations are far behind the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised powers and other wealthy states.In terms of doses administered so far, the imbalance between the G7 and low-income countries, as defined by the World Bank, is 73 to one.Novavax’s vaccine – formally known as NVX-CoV2373 – can be stored in normal refrigerators.The company said it was “stored and stable at 2°-8°C, allowing the use of existing vaccine supply chain channels for its distribution.“In theory at least, this means the shots should be more easily transported and administered in countries with less well-developed health infrastructures.”The two-dose vaccine consists of modified SARS-CoV-2 viral spike proteins encased in a synthetic lipid nanoparticle, accompanied by a saponin-based adjuvant.Doses are to be given three weeks apart. – AFP Relaxnews"
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",8:05 AM MYT,Lifestyle,LEESAN,Does fugu sperm wine help men be 'stronger' and celebrate Father's Day?,"A travel buddy told me that he had heard about “fugu” (pufferfish), and that eating it is good for one’s health. But because it’s also poisonous, he wouldn’t dare try it.During the Shogunate Era, around 270AD, there were reports of samurais dying after eating fugu. As such, at the end of the 16th century, General Toyotomi Hideyoshi banned the consumption of fugu. However, people living in the Yamaguchi prefecture in Kyushu still ate the so-called deadly fish, simply because it was so delicious.In October 1868, at the start of the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese people – who were under a new emperor – secretly started eating fugu. But due to a shortage of chefs who were capable of handling fugu professionally, many people were poisoned and died after eating the fish.Consequently, the Meiji government tightened its control on the consumption of fugu.The fugu’s liver is intensely toxic, and a person could be killed within 10 to 30 minutes after ingesting the toxin by accident, unless he or she is rushed to the hospital immediately.Having said that, though, the proteins in fugu have exceptional medicinal value, and you can be sure that the courageous Japanese people are not going to give up such a wonderful god-sent delicacy.Hirobumi Ito, who became Japan’s first prime minister in December 1885 (and served for a total of four terms) tried for the very first time a fugu hot pot dish specially prepared for him by Fujino-san at Shunpanro restaurant in his native Yamaguchi prefecture. He was impressed by the meal.Ito later insisted that everyone should try this wonderful gastronomic gift from heaven. In 1888, he lifted the ban on the consumption of fugu, and naturally, Shunpanro became the primary base for fugu ryori or the cooking of fugu.Other prefectures and cities, meanwhile, could not keep up with Yamaguchi as there weren’t many chefs who knew how to handle the delicate fish.The 53-year-old Ito also used Shunpanro to promote fugu internationally.For example, the 29-day negotiation of the Treaty of Shimonoseki, one of the century’s most monumental historical events between Japan and China, was held at Shunpanro in 1895. Ito served fugu to the 72-year-old chief negotiator from China’s Qing dynasty, Li Hongzhang, and his delegation.Unfortunately, Li declined the meal for fear of getting poisoned.Li and his delegation were aware that fugu was such a precious premium culinary treat, and turning down the meal may have consequences. During the course of the negotiation, Li was shot in his left cheek by a rebel named Toyotaro Koyama.The Meiji government apologised to the Qing dynasty government.On June 16, 1909, Ito again enjoyed his favourite fugu hot pot at Shunpanro. The following day, he boarded a ship to the Korean peninsula, which followed a trip to Dalian in China. He arrived at the Harbin railway station on June 26, but was unfortunately killed there by Korean nationalist An Jung-geun.Ito had objected to the colonisation of Manchuria by Japan, but he couldn’t do anything to change anything. His assassination was about 10 days after he ate fugu for the very last time.(Some of these historical facts on fugu are based on Hisako Kuroiwa’s book, Diplomacy On The Tip Of The Tongue.)Today, whenever Japanese folks enjoy a fugu feast, they may just be reminded of Ito, I guess. He once said that it is a heavenly food all Japanese people must enjoy together.While fugu has slowly become a unique delicacy that ordinary citizens can enjoy today, the dish is only available for dine-in customers at specialised fugu restaurants. Most of these shops offer five different ways of enjoying the fish, namely shredded fish skin in vinegar; thin sashimi slices; deep fried fish fillets; hot pot with fish meat, fish bone, cabbage, tofu and kombu; and fugu rice porridge with egg and seaweed.During the last Fukui tour that I led with renowned food critic Chua Lam, he made a special arrangement for group members to go to the Hamato Fugu Restaurant at Kuroshio Market in Osaka for lunch.At this restaurant, the chefs demonstrated how to kill a live fugu, which was impressive. But while they did this, many in the group began to worry whether the toxins from the fish would splash onto them!Chua assured them that will never happen as the folks who work at the restaurant are all seasoned fugu chefs. He also playfully said, “Look at the fugu sperm. The gentlemen here should try the fugu sperm wine later, there is no fishy smell at all. It’ll make you strong tonight!”I think that most foodies are not afraid of the fugu toxin, and would not think twice about eating the fish – provided it was handled by experts, of course. Some especially like to challenge themselves and try the fugu’s liver and stomach lining, usually served finely chopped and seasoned with green onion vinegar, and a special Japanese condiment.I must say that this dish is particularly delicious – simply heavenly!Pufferfish-rearing has become a high-value aquacultural industry today. Nevertheless, in Yamaguchi prefecture, which has so far produced eight Japanese prime ministers including Hirobumi Ito, Eisaku Sato and Shinzo Abe, people still insist on eating wild-caught fugu instead.When we can all travel again, I’ll take you to Shunpanro to eat fugu.The views expressed are entirely the writer’s own.Leesan, the founder of Apple Vacations, has travelled to 132 countries, six continents and enjoys sharing his travel stories and insights.

""We understand that many countries, not just ours, are considering what is the best way to deal with this, based on the situation.”Still, the country also has a history of defending Myanmar generals. In 2019, Ambassador Maruyama said ""there is no genocide in Myanmar” in response to a case at the International Court of Justice over allegations of atrocities on its Muslim Rohingya population in western Rakhine State.""We fully believe that the Myanmar military will keep its promise” to prosecute anyone who committed human-rights abuses, the Irrawaddy quoted him as saying.Beijing has blocked uniform sanctions at the United Nations Security Council and said its policy toward Myanmar was unaffected by the coup, granting the regime legitimacy on the world stage.""Given how much money they have put in, and the fact that they see it as geo-economic competition with China, they are very hesitant to pull out, ” Simon Tay, chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, said regarding Japan.Japan’s ties with the Southeast Asian country go back to World War II, when the regime in Tokyo helped revolutionaries led by Aung San - father of modern Myanmar and the now detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi - form the Tatmadaw in its fight for independence. While Japan later occupied Myanmar until 1945 and Aung San turned against them, the countries have maintained close relations even under long periods of military rule.When Myanmar ushered in sweeping political and economic reforms about a decade ago, Japan was rewarded with high-status projects, joining with public enterprises to establish the Yangon Stock Exchange and the country’s only operational special economic zone. As of April, Japan was its third largest foreign investor nation behind Singapore and China, with nearly $2.4 billion in capital since the 2016-17 fiscal year, according to data from Myanmar’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration.But since the Feb. 1 coup, companies have come under intense pressure to back away from investments tied to the military after security forces killed hundreds of protesters.Among them is Kirin Holdings Co., which said days after the coup it would end its joint-venture partnership with military-run Myanma Economic Holdings Public Co. in the country’s largest brewer after buying a $560 million majority stake six years earlier. In a statement, the company said it’s ""taking urgent steps” to terminate the arrangement but didn’t have a timeline yet.Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group was listed in a December report by Justice for Myanmar among international companies connected to Telecom International Myanmar Co. Ltd., or Mytel, a company the U.S. Department of the Treasury said was set up by Min Aung Hlaing. A Mitsubishi spokesperson said the company doesn’t comment on individual businesses.Justice for Myanmar alleges that Mytel’s biggest shareholder, Viettel Group, which is owned by Vietnam’s Defense Ministry, mines user-data that could be used for military purposes by the Myanmar junta. The regime had also ordered operators to shut their networks in an effort to stifle protests following the coup. A Viettel spokesperson said the company would not comment on the issue, while Mytel didn't respond to multiple requests via email and phone for comment.The Japanese government is more concerned with economic and human security in Myanmar than punishing the military with coercive moves, according to Moe Thuzar, a fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.""The half measures here are probably intended as negotiation points toward a constructive outcome, ” she said. ""The risk here is of course the military junta manipulating any space that it is given, or deciding to ‘walk with fewer friends.’” - Bloomberg"

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,News,MAHIR ALI,Bye bye Bibi...,"AMONG the various heads of state and government who have seemed like permanent fixtures on the international political landscape in the past decade or so, no one’s perch has looked as precarious as that of Benjamin Netanyahu. There’s a degree of irony in the fact that Israel’s longest-serving prime minister apparently ran out of steam midway through the presidential term of one of the most fervent White House admirers he could conceivably have attracted.It’s all relative, of course. Ever since its inception, Israel has never not had an ally in the White House, and occasional tensions have scarcely dampened US enthusiasm for – let alone hindered its munificence towards – what was identified early on as an invaluable satellite in a region once deemed broadly hostile to US interests.The Obama administration, for instance, set a record in generosity, notwithstanding the toxic personal chemistry between Bibi and Barack. By then, it hardly looked like a case of the tail wagging the dog. The transformation may not have been sudden, but Netanyahu had few qualms about treating America as the tail.He was happy to do most of the barking until another top dog chimed in, determined, as the leader of the pack, to be louder than anyone else. And loyally tagging along behind Donald was Jared Kushner.Even Trump and Kushner apparently baulked, however, when Netanyahu talked about fulfilling his dream of annexing much of the occupied West Bank. Had the US flashed the green light, enabling him to pursue this project, Netanyahu would probably still be prime minister, and Israel would almost certainly be embroiled in a military campaign far more vicious than its most recent assault on the Gaza Strip.The latter did not suffice to keep him in power – not least because a substantial proportion of Israelis are under the impression that he chickened out. Unable to pull together a coalition after Israel’s fourth election in two years, Netanyahu predictably ranted against the alternative regime that was taking shape.In the past couple of weeks he has ludicrously labelled his opponents as dangerous and far left. The new prime minister, Naftali Bennett, is an extremist all right, but on the other end of the ideological spectrum. He has served Netanyahu as chief of staff and in various ministerial capacities, and throughout his political career has been described as even more right wing than his former master.In the past he has not only enthusiastically hailed the idea of West Bank annexation but also proudly boasted about seeing “no problem” having “killed lots of Arabs in my life”. As a prime minister at the head of a disparate – and desperate – eight-party coalition, whose Yamina party boasts only six seats in the 120-member Knesset, he has at first indicated that there will be no movement on the Palestinian front.The idea that the status quo can indefinitely be maintained while the state-sponsored settlers (whom Bennett has been proud to represent) keep gnawing away at what’s left of the diminishing Palestinian territories is one of Netanyahu’s proudest achievements. There’s no need to bother with a deal, not even with an eagerly compliant Palestinian “authority” in place under Mahmoud Abbas, who put off his elections to ward off the likelihood of another triumph for Hamas.That likelihood has only increased in recent months, but yet another Israeli election before the end of the year cannot be written off. After all, the Bennett-led coalition has the bare minimum parliamentary support necessary, and Netanyahu as opposition leader will no doubt continue trying to topple his rivals. The “Bye bye Bibi” placards displayed by jubilant demonstrators after his comeuppance may prove to have been premature.Does any of this matter very much? Not for the Palestinians. Sure, there is an Arab Islamist party on the fringes of the Bennett coalition, playing pretty much the sort of collaborationist role that the odd relatively unrepresentative black organisation did under South African apartheid. It also includes the Meretz and Labour parties, which remain wedded, at least formally, to the fantasy of a two-state solution.What’s far more important is that the political centre has shifted sharply to the right – Netanyahu deserves some of the credit for that, but the narrowing of the political spectrum from the centre right to the far right is by no means an exclusively Israeli phenomenon. Hardly anywhere, though, is the political system more fractured: what once were factions have evolved into a plethora of parties, and one-party majorities are now a thing of the past.Netanyahu has hitherto thrived on this dysfunction, but whether he can exploit it much longer remains to be seen. The criminal justice system may catch up with him. One thing that won’t change, however, is what Joe Biden reiterated last week: “Israel has no better friend than the United States.” Which in effect means nothing will really change. — Dawn/Asia News Network"
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,News,KIM MYONG-SIK,New age of politics calls for high morality,"DURING an open debate before he was elected chairman of South Korea’s main Opposition People Power Party last week, Lee Jun-seok said he made “several hundred million won (several hundred thousand dollars)” through cryptocurrency trading. Later he reported spending just 30 million won (RM109, 458), seemingly from these earnings, for his intra-party leadership campaign.It is no surprise that the 36-year-old prodigy who majored in computer science and economics at Harvard University is so well versed in today’s digital culture and technology that he made a profitable investment in the virtual money market. It was rather admirable, in fact, that he had time to do so amidst the rigours of the leadership contest that immediately followed the People Power Party’s landslide win in mayoral by-elections in Seoul and Busan. The victories came after he had been given just two years to manage the part. The youngest ever Opposition leader is destined to make his mark in history including a possible takeover of power from the current leftist rulers.An Opposition surge has continued after the vote in South Korea’s two largest metropolises with the People Power Party outrunning the ruling Democratic Party of Korea in popularity polls for the first time in four years. But the outlook for a candidate for the March 9, 2022, presidential election is still hazy because Lee can’t run as he doesn’t meet the minimum age requirement of 40.Lee’s rise to Opposition leadership has signalled the rush towards the political stage of the younger “20-30” generation in Korea. They began asserting themselves as the main protesters in demonstrations against former president Park Geun-hye’s misrule in late 2016. After four years, they have become the core complainants against the present Moon Jae-in government.It is unfortunate that the latter part of Moon’s five-year rule coincided with the raging coronavirus pandemic on top of poor results of his ineffective economic policies. Jobs disappeared across the board, more seriously in the youth’s domain of service work, and government handouts mainly benefited the older population. Galloping apartment prices under short-sighted regulations pushed young wage earners into despair because housing ownership is farther away.Korea’s younger generation traditionally tilts to the left while right- wingers rely on the sympathy of the older populace. However, Moon’s failures changed the direction of political dynamics in Korea. Generational stereotypes are no longer evident – and Lee seized the opportunity for his ambition.A new age is arriving and pundits are seeing the need for the traditional right-wing force to give up their regional and generational bases. The conservatives have remained defensive following democratic reforms in the late 1980s as they have inevitably been regarded as reactionaries to political progress. Winning and losing power alternately and undergoing divisions and mergers, the right-wing force kept changing their name time and again over the years until settling on the People Power Party after the staggering defeat in Assembly elections last year.The party now has to search for a presidential candidate from outside the rather than inside, as its uneven history has depleted its leadership assets. The first order of business for chairman Lee is to invite former Prosecutor-General Yoon Seok-youl and the centrist Ahn Cheol-su to join the his party and stage a spectacular nomination race.As the stature of Yoon looms large aided by the Lee Jun-seok phenomenon, the ruling camp is concentrating on exposing any dirty linen in the former top prosecutor’s personal life and impropriety in his role as the top hunter of the “past evil” during the early days of the Moon’s rule. Yoon will have his first taste of politics when he defends himself against the mudslinging.In countering the leftist offensive, the People Power Party and supporting right-wingers should keep two principles: First, they should never compromise their moral high ground, and second, they should be flexible about their conservative values. Half of the reason for the Moon administration’s loss of the people’s trust is the moral degradation of its star figures and the other half is the miserable outcome of its ideology-dictated economic policies.The coming presidential polls in March and local elections in June 2022 will be an exciting time because parties will abandon traditional criteria in the nomination process and much emphasis will be placed on the ability to communicate with younger voters. Those who know the language of the digital culture and are comfortable playing with its products have a clear advantage.Lee is opening a new chapter in Korean politics which drives people to seek power not just for power’s sake but in pursuit of fresh ideals. The beautiful irony is that Lee represents not a progressive party but a conservative one. – The Korean Herald/Asia News Network"
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,News,EDDIE RAZAK,Getting public policies right,"FAIZAL is having a difficult time coping with the Covid-19 pandemic. Previously a Grab ride-hailing driver, he no longer has a reliable income as there are fewer or even no trips at all whenever there is a tightening of the movement control order. He has considered doing motorcycle food delivery but as a family man, found it too competitive and not worth the physical risk. With a wife and three small children to support, he looks forward to things being as they were before as he ponders his immediate future.There is hope on the horizon in the form of the vaccination programme. But Faizal is hesitant about getting him and his wife vaccinated due to concerns about side effects and what it will mean to his children. He wants to wait and see. Meanwhile, the government knows that it needs to vaccinate 80% of the population to achieve a statistical herd immunity nationwide.Vaccine hesitancy is a policy obstacle. There are “anti-vaxxers” even among educated people in advanced countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 global health threats. Among the reasons why people do not want to get vaccinated are safety concerns, religious beliefs, personal philosophical views, and mistrust of authority and of science. So while Faizal wants things to improve and hopes that the government will do something to help him, he does not want to take the vaccine, at least not yet.Nudging behavioursIt turns out that people often make bad choices that lead to self-harm. This is not due to lack of education or some form of mental deficiency, but a typical trait of being human. It is not necessarily a bad thing; it is what makes humans survive and thrive. You can say that humans are constructive and destructive at the same time.What is interesting about this seeming “irrationality” in people is that it is predictable and happens everywhere, whether in America, Europe, Africa or Asia.You can predict the kinds of biases people have and decisions they are likely to make anywhere and everywhere. You can predict people’s expected behaviour and nudge it accordingly.Therefore, policymakers would need to understand behavioural insights when developing and implementing policies that affect the general public. Using these insights, policymakers can nudge behaviours towards a desired outcome that serves a common good.Behavioural insights in economic theoryTraditional economics assumes that people are rational and make decisions based on information, logic and self-interest, that result in a common good. However, behavioural economists, among them Nobel laureates Richard Thaler, Daniel Kahneman, Abhijit Banerjee and Hebert Simon, have shown that humans have certain ways of thinking that shape their choices and the outcomes. Such research has become the foundation of new economic theory that incorporates behavioural insights.Government policymaking based on old school economics tends to be framed around regulation and enforcement, and assumes that the right price, incentives and information will result in successful policies. But when policies do not consider human behaviour, public response may be different from what is expected.Let’s look at some examples. Mandatory recycling by households and businesses introduced a few years back is a policy that has exhausted its options and has since been abandoned. The policy required waste to be sorted into coloured bags (blue for paper; white for plastics; green for glass, cans and other recyclables; yellow for plant waste; and black for food, organic and nonrecyclable waste).People found this complicated. Although there was an awareness programme to educate the public, and despite the authorities issuing warning letters and imposing fines of between RM50 and RM200 (with a threat of raising it to RM1, 000), it was hard to comply with because people had to find and spend money on coloured waste bags, and spend time sorting waste. In terms of behavioural change, it was not habit-forming and didn’t fit into the pace of life. The authorities themselves found that managing and enforcing the policy had become burdensome, too.On the other hand, retailers charging 20 sen for a plastic bag is a policy that has successfully encouraged a shift to reusable bags. The disincentive is small, but it got results.Policymaking with people in mindFailed policies are often blamed on people’s mindsets, which assumes that the policy is inherently good and the problem is the public’s cognitive weakness and negative attitudes.But policy cannot be created in a vacuum without considering human behaviour and the public’s response.What is mindset? It is people’s beliefs, biases and habits that form behaviours. Biases are shaped by people’s self-identity, community and society, of how they see themselves and the people they interact with. People tend to behave like others they identify with.And because people have limited attention spans and willpower, they rely on heuristics to make decisions. Heuristics are guesstimates or rules-of-thumb that people use to compare and contrast things they think they know, to quickly arrive at a choice in their busy world. For example, something that happened to someone becomes an analogy in their thought process. Although heuristics can be flawed, people use them as mental shortcuts to make decisions. Think of it as fuzzy logic, which is flawed but essential to arrive at a solution.Policymakers need to understand the interplay of human behaviours and public response, as it can affect the success or failure of government policies.Sometimes, when things don’t work as intended, policymakers pile up additional regulation and enforcement as quick remedies. It is no good to keep tweaking the wrong policy response. Regulation and enforcement add an administrative and financial burden that may not improve the result. Monetary rewards and penalties and information campaigns can be costly but unproductive. The wrong policy tweaks can lead to policy failure.Nudging behaviours may be a better way to get the right results. It can avoid unnecessary regulation and pouring resources into enforcement. It is cheaper than costly subsidies and incentives. It gives people the freedom to make good choices rather than hurt them with punitive action.This is not to say that regulations, incentives and penalties are not needed. Rather, the goal is to optimise behavioural response within policy implementation.Behavioural nudges can be as simple as the daily messages sent directly to the public through texting platforms, for example, to reassure and remind people about pandemic precautions. It works alongside laws and enforcement of SOPs by the government.Behavioural change as collective policy actionThe Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance of behavioural change. Before there was a vaccine, medical science had little to offer in terms of prevention and containment of the virus, save for physical distancing, wearing a mask and washing hands. Now that there are vaccines available, we need people to want to be vaccinated. That too is behavioural change.Indeed, some of our biggest problems, like healthcare and lifestyle diseases, education and social mobility, climate change and environmental protection, require both government and society to come together in some collective action. For that we need to merge behavioural insights into policymaking.Behavioural insights have many applications but are particularly suited to good policymaking. Think of behavioural insights as a way to promote positive civics and ethics through nudging. This can help overcome roadblocks in policy development.Many countries, such as Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Australia and Singapore, have behavioural insights as part of government policy development. In Malaysia, the Economic Planning Unit is encouraging the use of behavioural insights for smarter government policies.To this end, the Malaysia Productivity Corporation (MPC) is working with various ministries and agencies and with knowledge experts and other stakeholders to expand the application of behavioural insights in government and industry. To know more about the practical aspects of nudging behaviours, look at various literature and case studies as well as the activities of the Behavioural Insights Malaysia community group on Facebook that MPC hosts.Eddie Razak is a consultant on social development and public policy, and was a student of Behavioural Insights while at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,Asean+,,"Spread of Delta variant prevented, says expert","There has been no community transmission of the more transmissible Delta Covid-19 variant even if 13 cases had been detected in the country, according to infectious disease expert Edsel Salvana, a member of the technical advisory group of the Department of Health (DOH).“It looks like we have prevented its spread to the community for now, although this is being closely monitored because what the Delta variant has caused in other countries is scary,” Salvana said.Salvana said all 13 individuals were returning travellers, and nine of them were from the Covid-19-stricken vessel Athens Bridge, which was allowed to dock in Manila last month after being refused entry in Vietnam.The doctor stressed the need for caution and compliance with health and quarantine protocols to prevent the spread of the Delta variant, which was first detected in India.The Delta variant, he said, had been found to be 60% more infectious than the Alpha variant and apparently behind the surge in cases in other countries.It also appeared to cause more severe cases of Covid-19, he said, based on his experience caring for four out of the 13 Delta variant cases detected locally, one of whom had died.Also on Friday, the government reset to June 22 – instead of June 16 – the implementation of a shorter, seven-day quarantine for incoming travellers who had been fully vaccinated in the Philippines.This means that such passengers who are arriving before June 22 must still quarantine for 10 days in a facility, take a swab test on the seventh day, and complete a four-day home quarantine.The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) moved the date to complete the setup of a validation process for vaccination certificates, according to presidential spokesman Harry Roque.The IATF earlier said that for these inbound travellers to be allowed to take the shorter quarantine, their vaccination cards must be verified prior to their departure from the Philippines.

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,Asean+,,Calls mount for lockdown,"WITH Indonesia seeing significant rises in the number of Covid-19 cases in the past weeks, pressure is piling up on the government to impose stricter restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus.The Health Ministry announced a record daily rise in the last four months for two days in a row, with 12,624 and 12,990 new confirmed cases on Thursday and Friday, respectively.While many presumed the high mobility of millions of people during the Aidilfitri holiday season last month had triggered the surge, the situation was likely exacerbated by the Delta coronavirus variant, which was first detected in India and is thought to be more transmissible than other strains.Despite the exponential case spike, authorities are still relying on the micro-scale public activity restrictions (PPKM Mikro) to curb further transmission of the virus, although many criticised the policy for being too lenient.Under the restrictions, neighbourhood units and community units are required to enforce restrictions that best suit their level of risk.The higher the risk of transmission, the tighter the restrictions to be enforced. Public places such as shopping malls are also allowed to operate until 9pm, while restaurants are allowed to have dine-in customers at 50% of their maximum capacity.Under the previous policy of large-scale social restrictions, restaurants were only allowed to serve takeaway and delivery services, while public places were permitted to operate until 7pm.Experts and doctors have urged the government to impose tighter wide-scale restrictions to prevent further transmission, as the country’s healthcare system had been overwhelmed with the high number of Covid-19 patients.Epidemiologist Riris Andono Ahmad of Gadjah Mada University called PPKM Mikro “an illogical policy” from an epidemiology standpoint, as the policy was implemented when cases were already widespread.“The best approach the government can take now is making sure 70% of the population stay home for at least three weeks,” he said.Griffith University epidemiologist Dicky Budiman warned this would be the time for Indonesia “to hit the emergency brake” and impose widespread restrictions in Java and Bali, the country’s two most populous islands, as well as large cities in Sumatra and Kalimantan.“Imposing a lockdown for two weeks is the only way to prevent our healthcare facilities from going into chaos, especially considering other strategies of testing and treatment are still inadequate,” he said. — The Jakarta Post/ANN"

Five executives were arrested. Law and Cheung were charged on Friday while the three others were released on bail pending further investigations.""We will continue to publish our paper tomorrow,"" deputy chief editor Chan Pui-man said outside court. She was released late Friday on bail.Dozens of supporters were queuing to get seats in court on Saturday morning, including many former and current employees of Apple Daily.A staff member, who gave her surname as Chang, said she and many other Apple Daily employees treat ""every day like it is our last"" working for the paper.""At first, authorities said the national security law would only target a tiny number of people,"" she told AFP.""But what has happened showed us that is nonsense,"" she added.Another staff reporter, who gave her first name as Theresa, said she felt Apple Daily's legal troubles were a warning shot.""I think what has happened to Apple Daily today can eventually happen to every other news outlet in the city,"" she said.- Plunging press freedom -Multiple international media companies have regional headquarters in Hong Kong, attracted to the business-friendly regulations and free speech provisions written into the city's mini-constitution.But many are now questioning whether they have a future there and are drawing up contingency plans as Beijing presses on with a broad crackdown on dissent in the city.Local media have an even tougher time, with journalist associations saying reporters are increasingly having to self-censor.Hong Kong has steadily plunged down an annual press freedom ranking by Reporters Without Borders, from 18th place in 2002 to 80th this year.Mainland China languishes at 177th out of 180, above only Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea.Hong Kong and Chinese officials say the arrests were not an attack on the media.Earlier this week, security secretary John Lee described Apple Daily as a ""criminal syndicate"".Apple Daily is by far the most outspoken of Hong Kong's pro-democracy media outlets. But it is not clear how long it can survive.Its wealthy owner Lai, 73, is currently serving multiple jail sentences for his involvement in democracy rallies in 2019.He has also been charged under the national security law and has had his Hong Kong assets frozen.Authorities froze a further HK$18 million (US$2.3 million) of Apple Daily's company assets on Thursday.Police say they also plan to prosecute three companies owned by Apple Daily under the security law, which could see the paper fined or banned.It is the first time companies, rather than an individual, have faced a national security investigation.Mark Simon, an aide to Lai who lives overseas, said the paper would have difficulty paying its staff of about 700.Company lawyers were trying to work out the breadth of the asset freeze order, he added.""Money is not an issue. Draconian orders from Beijing via the NSL (national security law) are the issue,"" he told AFP. - AFP"

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Business,INTAN FARHANA ZAINUL,Winding road to recovery,"A probable downward revision in growth prospects notwithstanding, the National Recovery Plan brings much certainty to an economic landscape deeply affected by the pandemicON Wednesday, the day after the announcement of the National Recovery Plan (NRP), the local stock market hardly stirred.The benchmark index closed up a mere two points or 0.12%, indicating that investors still remain fluid to the developments that surround the disease and also the economy.Feeling sanguine would be appropriate when the key indicators start moving, but for now, having thresholds and targets is something that at least gives grounds for some clarity.While the NRP is a good plan, it hinges on things that are still not within anyone’s control, such as the number of Covid-19 admissions into the intensive care unit or ICU and daily infection rates.But those in support of the plan say that it brings much certainty into an economic landscape that has been pummeled by the pandemic.“At least now there is a guide as to when we can open up. This goes some way in helping businesses plan for things like hiring new personnel and ramping up production or taking new orders. But the key is in execution, ” says one fund manager referring to vaccination targets.Going by the NRP, all economic sectors will be allowed to operate by the end of October 2021, provided more than 60% of the population is vaccinated with two doses. In addition, daily Covid-19 cases must be below 500.Judging by the recent numbers, that is some way to go before this is achieved.Reported daily Covid-19 cases this week were more than 5, 000. The good news is that it is a drop from the 9, 020 figure on May 29.A total of 4.9 million people or about 15% of the population have received at least one vaccine dose.Daily vaccinations have hit a new high of more than 215, 000 shots and expectations is that daily vaccination shots will increase to between 200, 000 and 250, 000 in July, and then hit 300, 000 to 400, 000 shots daily.Going by the NRP’s targets, 60% of the population should have their double doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of October.Observers point out that this is an ambitious target, especially should there be a delay in securing vaccines, highlighted by the hold-up in receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.Kenanga Research points out that in the best-case scenario, Malaysia could achieve “the 80% herd immunity target” as early as Dec 7, but lists out the steps that need to be taken.“To make this possible, Malaysia essentially needs to secure more Covid-19 vaccine supplies and deliveries and establish more Covid-19 vaccine centres, especially in rural areas. More manpower to effectively execute the process of vaccinating the public is also needed, ” Kenanga Research points out.Malaysia has three main vaccines approved for use, namely, Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Sinovac, all of which require two doses for maximum protection.This week, the government granted conditional approval for the emergency use of the single-dose Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by China’s CanSino Biologics and the United States drugmaker Johnson & Johnson.A fund manager points out that the government might want to consider fully opening the economy as early as September by ensuring that more people get their first dose, an approach adopted in the United Kingdom, Germany and Singapore.He also suggests the government look into alternative solutions to reduce the daily infection rate.“We can’t just depend on vaccinations alone since there are issues that could delay the process such as supply disruptions and new variants.“The UK is seeing a spike in new cases due to the delta variant, although about 80% of its adult population has received at least the first dose of the vaccine, ” he points out.Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid says that the NRP provides a clear timeline and a guide to reopening.“The public can then manage their expectations for what might happen between phases and take the necessary action to avoid any calamities, ” he tells StarBizWeek.Socio-Economic Research Centre (SERC) executive director Lee Heng Guie says the NRP should incorporate the kind of assistance the government is planning to help affected industries throughout the recovery period.“The stimulus packages we have now only focuses on the one-month lockdown. The government should also consider providing assistance for at least the next three to six months, especially for sectors that are not allowed to operate until the fourth phase, ” he says.The government has imposed a lockdown from June 1 to June 28 to be followed by a less stringent lockdown that will be divided into phases under the NRP.Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz says that the government is reviewing all existing measures and could introduce additional assistance to support the affected people and businesses, especially for economic sectors that would not be allowed to operate until the fourth phase.Lower GDP growth expectationsThe biggest drawback from the lockdown is its impact on the economy. Some economists estimate the one-month lockdown will shave off more than 2% of the country’s economic growth.Afzanizam is of the view that the country’s 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast should be revised lower.“Putting a cap on production capacity would have a negative impact on economic activity.“We have revised our 2021 GDP forecast to 4.2% from 5% previously, ” he says.SERC’s Lee has maintained his forecast of 4% GDP growth for this year.Malaysia’s central bank expects the economy to expand 6%-7.5% this year.On Thursday, Tengku Zafrul highlighted that the current lockdown was costing economic losses of RM1bil a day, but the amount would be reduced in the coming phases.That is far lower than the first round of the lockdown last year, which had cost the economy RM2.4bil a day and dragged the country’s GDP for April-June 2020 to its worst level since 1998.Not all analysts are cutting their forecasts as the current lockdown is less debilitating than the MCO 1.0 last year.Kenanga Research expects the impact of the current lockdown to be less severe than last year, as consumers and businesses are more prepared.The research house has maintained its GDP forecast for this year at 5%-6%, but sees the need to inject additional fiscal stimulus to aid economic recovery. “The retail sector will remain pressured in the near term, as consumer activities would be weighed by the tightened mobility restrictions and closure of non-essential stores, ” the research house says.SERC’s Lee points out that external demand provides a buffer to the economy as domestic demand wanes.“While strong export demand could partially offset weak domestic demand, there are some exporters affected by the lockdown, ” he explains.Malaysia’s exports increased 63% year-on-year (y-o-y) in April to RM105.6bil, driven by manufactured goods of electrical and electronic products. These include semiconductors used in 5G technology and high-performance computing, as well as rubber products.Afzanizam points out that while the export-oriented industries are seen to be the immediate beneficiaries in the global recovery, the momentum has been disrupted due to the recent lockdown.He expects the economy to accelerate in 2022 as domestic demand picks up with sectors such as tourism, airlines, food and beverage, and entertainment to be the immediate beneficiaries.“M1, which is money in circulation, and demand deposits have been growing quite steeply since the pandemic erupted in March last year. What it means is that there is a lot of cash in the hands of the public.“Therefore, should the economy fully reopen next year, we can expect private consumption to return to a more healthy level, driving GDP growth into a higher trajectory, ” he says.Strategic action for the economyIndustry players are suggesting that the NRP ought to include a detailed strategy for businesses.Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai says businesses need help on how to plan their survival strategy, as the prolonged period of non-operation has severely impacted their viability.“Some would have to make hard and painful decisions if there is no clear indication on when they would be allowed to resume operations.“FMM has called on the government to allow export-based businesses and those in crucial supply chains as well as smaller sized companies to resume operations, ” he says.FMM points out that under the current lockdown, almost 80% of businesses fall into the non-essential category and are therefore not allowed to operate.And for the businesses that are allowed to operate, only a 60% operational capacity is allowed.To expedite vaccination among the private sector, the government has also announced a public-private partnership (PPP) immunisation initiative dubbed the Public-Private Partnership Industrial Covid-19 Immunisation Programme (Pikas).Under the programme, which has been tasked to the International Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti), the government will provide the vaccines but participating companies are required to fully bear administration costs for their employees.Many quarters are now highlighting the importance of vaccination as the key to exit the Covid-19 crisis.However, it can’t be the only strategy as there are also other risks that can slow down the vaccination process such as logistics, hiccups in supply and new variants.The government should also consider looking at other alternatives to achieve its NRP timeline as a longer lockdown can be damaging to the economy.It will be a winding road to recovery but the NRP roadmap would guide the economy in the right direction.As the country raises its hope that the targets of the NRP are met, yesterday’s Covid-19 cases sent a grim reminder of the challenges ahead. With 6, 440 new cases, it still remains above the 4, 000-threshold that is essential to start the recovery plan."
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Business,GANESHWARAN KANA,"Best is yet to come, says cash-rich Greatech","CASH-RICH Greatech Technology Bhd, whose latest first-quarter sales surged by over 80% year-on-year, believes that the best is yet to come.With over two decades of experience in automating factories globally, the Penang-based company has set out plans to grow its footprint even further by acquiring new companies, boosting production capacity and expanding the range of its product offerings.The group, which has been highly-reliant on the solar industry for orders, also wants to widen its revenue base by increasing its presence in other product segments such as semiconductors and sensors as well as life sciences.A quick check on its 2020 annual report showed that over 95% of its topline were contributed by only three clients. In fact, almost 61% of total revenue is attributed to one undisclosed client.Hence, it is unsurprising that Greatech seeks to widen its revenue base, considering the need to minimise the risk of relying on very few customers.In the near future, Greatech expects its electric vehicle (EV) energy storage segment to be a major contributor to revenue, potentially overtaking the solar segment. This, however, does not mean that the contribution from the solar segment will begin to reduce.Over the next two years, Greatech executive director and CEO Tan Eng Kee foresees the EV energy storage and solar segments to remain strong.“Based on current global development, we believe the renewable energy segment will have a bigger potential growth for Greatech, especially in the EV energy storage segment as this is an emerging technology and market,” he tells StarBizWeek.Earlier this month, concerns emerged on the group’s EV energy storage business, after one of its largest customers – Lordstown Motor Corp – was reported to have been facing cash constraints to commence full commercial production.However, in a reply to StarBiz earlier, Tan described the issue as “small and manageable” and said that Greatech expects to continue doing business with the US-based electric pick-up truck start-up Lordstown Motor.Tan added that Greatech’s contract with Lordstown Motor would expire in September and it is expected to be renewed in one or two months.“They (Lordstown) have said that their business will continue amid the latest developments, ” he said.PublicInvest Research, in a note on July 11, also said it was not “overly concerned” on Greatech’s payment collection from Lordstown, as Greatech had managed to collect an additional RM80mil from the buyer within three months.Meanwhile, the recent newsflow about US-based solar panel maker First Solar Inc planning to invest US$680mil (RM2.8bil) in a new factory in Ohio is also expected to benefit Greatech, says Tan.First Solar is a major client for Greatech. Although the group has declined to disclose revenue contributions from First Solar, it is noteworthy that Greatech has a long-standing relationship with the company and in the financial year 2018 (FY18), First Solar group of companies accounted for almost 88% of Greatech’s revenue, based on its listing prospectus.“Ongoing discussion with First Solar for the new plant in Ohio is actively taking place.“We are not able to comment much on this at the moment pending the finalisation of the deal with the customer,” he adds.First Solar’s new Ohio plant is expected to have a capacity to produce up to 3GW worth of solar panels annually, with target completion of the plant in early-2023.Tan points out that the group’s order book value stood at RM293mil as of April 9, and this is expected to provide earnings visibility until the first half of 2022.Supported by the continued growth in the EV energy storage and solar segments, Tan expects 2023 to be the “best year for Greatech”.Tan is the single largest shareholder with an equity interest of 68% in Greatech. Along with Khor Lean Heng, who is Greatech’s executive director and chief operating officer, Tan established the group back in 1997.Guided by three-year planLooking ahead, Tan says that Greatech has established a “three-year plan” to diversify into other segments.Following this, the group has also embarked on increased spending for research and development (R&D) efforts to expand its product range.In the financial year of 2020 (FY20), the group has spent about RM9.3mil for R&D, and as for the current FY21, it has allocated about RM12mil.Backed by its strong cash position, Greatech says that it is actively looking to acquire strategic fit foreign companies as it seeks to expand its market presence internationally. Tan points out that the companies would likely be in the life sciences and the EV energy storage segments.As of end-March 2021, the group’s cash and cash equivalents stood at RM312.82mil, against total borrowings of just RM18.27mil.Emphasis on research and development“Additionally, Greatech is also actively involved in development of new products in emerging markets whereby we foresee the R&D cost will increase year over year.“The group has allocated internally generated funds of RM77mil for capital expenditure in FY21, of which RM50mil is allocated for land and construction of new facility in Batu Kawan, Penang while the remaining balance of RM27mil is for the investment of machinery, equipment and information technology.“The group is currently assessing the capacity of the existing plants and may utilise its cash position to increase and accelerate the assembly capacity and the investment of machinery for fabrication capacity,” says Tan.For a high-growth company like Greatech, Tan says its biggest challenge is talent development, where a large team of engineers is required to implement the group’s “three-year plan”.“Hence, the group has established the Young Engineering Programme (YEP) to train and develop the graduate engineers as a measure to build a capable and focus-driven talent pool for the group,” he points out.Commenting on Greatech’s financial performance outlook, Tan strongly believes that FY21 will be a “positive and strong” year for the group.Greatech began its FY21 on a strong footing after its first quarter ended March 31 reported a 80.4% increase in revenue to RM95.14mil, as compared to RM52.74mil a year earlier.The increase was mainly attributable to the higher revenue recognised for production line systems supplied to the electric vehicle (EV) energy storage industry.Meanwhile, the net profit in the first quarter surged by 2.5 times year-on-year to RM46.62mil.The stronger bottomline was mainly due to the increased reversal of unused provision for warranties of RM8.49mil made in the prior years as well as the favourable gross margin mix benefits realised from engineering design works.Greatech reported a 51.9% gross profit margin for the first quarter ended March 31.“Excluding the effects of net reversal of unused provision for warranties of RM5.23mil and net provision for warranties of RM2.90mil, the normalised gross profit margin would be 46.41% and 45.17% for this quarter and prior year corresponding quarter respectively,” the group said earlier in its results filing.Greatech’s initial public offering in June 2019 was one of the best-performing liftings on Bursa Malaysia in recent years. In a span of two years, from an offer price of just 61 sen, the stock has risen to RM5.64 per share as of yesterday."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",8:43 AM MYT,Business,,UK's Morrisons rejects takeover proposal from CD&R,"LONDON: British supermarket group Morrisons has rejected a proposed 5.52 billion pound ($7.62 billion or RM31.54bil) cash offer from U.S. private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R), saying it is far too low.Britain's fourth largest grocer by sales after Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, said it received the ""unsolicited, highly conditional non-binding"" proposal of 230 pence a share on Monday.The board of Bradford, northern England-based Morrisons rejected the proposal on Thursday.""The board of Morrisons evaluated the conditional proposal together with its financial adviser, Rothschild & Co, and unanimously concluded that the conditional proposal significantly undervalued Morrisons and its future prospects,"" the group said in a statement on Saturday.Shares in Morrisons, down 5.5% over the last year, closed on Friday at 182 pence, valuing the group at 4.33 billion pounds.Morrisons said CD&R's proposal provided for Morrisons shareholders to also still receive a final ordinary dividend of 5.11 pence per share announced on March 11.CD&R had earlier on Saturday said it was considering a possible cash offer for Morrisons.Under British takeover rules CD&R has until July 17 to announce a firm intention to make an offer.APPETITE FOR SUPERMARKETSCD&R's approach underlines private equity's growing appetite for UK supermarket assets, attracted by their cash generation and freehold assets.In February, Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital purchased a majority stake in Asda from Walmart in a deal valuing the UK supermarket group at 6.8 billion pounds.That deal followed Sainsbury's failure to take over Asda after an agreed deal was blocked by Britain's competition regulator in 2019.Morrisons has a partnership agreement with Amazon and there has been speculation it could emerge as a possible bidder.A formal bid from CD&R could involve Terry Leahy, the former Tesco CEO who is a senior adviser to CD&R.When at Tesco, Leahy was the boss of Andrew Higginson and David Potts, who are now Morrisons' chairman and CEO respectively.Morrisons, unique among British supermarket groups in making over half of the fresh food it sells, trades from about 500 stores and has 118, 000 staff, making it one of the country's biggest private sector employers.In March, the group reported a halving of annual profit due largely to costs incurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, but forecast a bounce back in the 2021-22 year.Earlier this month, Morrisons was rebuked by investors over executive pay, with more than 70% of votes cast at its annual shareholders' meeting rejecting its pay report. - Reuters"
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",8:39 AM MYT,Business,,Wall St week ahead - Fed shift causes rally in value stocks to wobble,"NEW YORK: The Federal Reserve's hawkish shift is forcing investors to reevaluate the rally in so-called value stocks, which have taken a hit in recent days after ripping higher for most of the year.Shares of banks, energy firms and other companies that tend to be sensitive to the economy’s fluctuations have tumbled following the Federal Reserve’s meeting on Wednesday, when the central bank surprised investors by anticipating two quarter-percentage-point rate increases in 2023 amid a recent surge in inflation.The Russell 1000 Value Stock Index is down 4% from its June peak, though still up 13.2% this year. Its growth counterpart is up 9.1% year-to-date.One factor driving the move is the idea that a Fed more strongly focused on preventing the economy from overheating may begin unwinding easy-money policies sooner than previously expected. On Friday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the central bank’s shift was a ""natural"" response to economic growth and inflation moving quicker than expected, bolstering that view.""Value stocks had gotten ahead of themselves, particularly in energy and financials, and the folks that are caught offsides are starting to unwind those trades, ” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group.The post-Fed meeting slide in value has been accompanied by a retreat in some commodity prices, a surge in the dollar and a rally in U.S. government bonds that dragged down yields on the benchmark U.S. Treasury to around 1.44% on Friday afternoon.Investors will be keeping a close eye on next week’s economic data for clues on whether the recent surge in inflation -- which saw consumer prices accelerate at their fastest pace in 12 years last month -- will persist.New home sales and mortgage applications are due out June 23, while May consumer spending numbers are expected on June 25.Investors piled into value stocks in the latter half of 2020, as signs of breakthroughs in vaccines against COVID-19 bolstered the case for a powerful economic rebound in 2021. Value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by nearly 7 percentage points since the start of November 2020, bucking a trend that saw technology and other growth sectors regularly outshine value over the last decade.An unwinding of the heavy positioning in value shares could exacerbate the recent slide. Mutual funds are overweight value names to a larger degree than any time in the last eight years, according to a Goldman Sachs report published on June 9.Some big-name investors such as Cathie Wood, whose ARK Innovation ETF was the top-performing U.S. equity fund last year, have suggested that growth stocks will resume their market outperformance as investors rotate away from value sectors such as energy that are up 38.5% since the start of the year. Wood’s flagship ETF is down 4.8% year-to-date.Others, however, believe the recent wobble in value stocks is a pause, rather than a turning point.Cyclical companies remain the least over-valued in the U.S. stock market, according to Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. High sales-growth companies are trading at valuations nearly double their 10-year averages, while cyclical companies are trading at valuations approximately 40% more than their historical levels, he wrote in a research note.The prospect of rising interest rates should also benefit higher quality value stock names that held up better in last year's downturn but have lagged during the recovery, said John Mowrey, chief investment officer at NFJ Investment Group.He has been increasing his positions in utility and consumer staples stocks that have underperformed value stocks as a whole, betting that they will increase their dividend payouts, which would make them more attractive even if Treasury yields eventually rise.Among his holdings are consumer companies Church & Dwight Co, which is down 4% for the year to date, and McCormick & Company Inc, which is down 9.7% for the year to date. ""The idea of dividend growth has been largely sidelined because we’ve all been enjoying stock appreciation,"" he said. ""We think this will be the next leg of the value stock rally."" - Reuters"
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",8:32 AM MYT,Business,,Bank stocks lurch into ranks of June’s worst as rally unravels,"NEW YORK: U.S. bank stocks are morphing from leaders into losers amid more signs that their searing 35% rally through this year’s first five months may have outrun the fundamentals.With two weeks left in the quarter, some investors aren’t waiting around to find out. The S&P 500 Banks Index, which rose three times more than the broad market through May, slid 8.1% this past week and more than 10% so far this month. This left indexes of the largest U.S. diversified lenders and regional banks ranking among June’s worst performers, with Citigroup Inc.’s drop of 14% leading its money-center peers and Regions Financial Corp. slumping 17%.The selloff coincides with the plateauing of earnings estimates and a rotation into growth stocks from value. It didn’t help that leaders of the biggest banks started the week by warning about a slump in trading revenue. Without stronger lending and a boost from higher interest rates, earnings probably won’t pick up.""I am troubled by the lack of supporting data on these companies, ” veteran bank analyst Dick Bove of Odeon Capital Group said in an email early in the week. Multiples were reaching 10-year highs, Bove said, even though ""there is no evidence to date that this recovery is underway.”JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank, set the tone on Monday when Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon warned that net interest income will be lower than previously anticipated, and that second-quarter trading revenue would be 38% below where it was a year ago. A similar message from Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason sent the lender spiraling by as much as 5% on Wednesday.Trading is more important to the big money-center institutions that run investment banks, but sluggish loan growth has also been a drag, and that’s central to the fortunes of regional banks. Profits have been helped by releasing reserves that had been set aside to cover loan losses that never materialized, thanks to massive federal stimulus programs that kept defaults at bay, but those releases are one-shot gains.Loans bring in earnings that are more repeatable, but Bove said the industry’s commercial loan volume is ""at recession levels, ” with home mortgages on bank books shrinking and credit-card loans under pressure. Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan offered a more upbeat assessment on Bloomberg TV Thursday, saying that demand was starting to pick up -- ""better than it was last fall or coming into the early spring.”Low rates help borrowers but tend to narrow profit margins for lenders. For now, it appears that not even Wednesday’s surprise that Federal Reserve officials anticipate two rate increases by the end of 2023 will be enough to push banks higher.Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said banks can be more profitable even with tight net interest margins if they can do more business because the economy is robust. The pitfall, he said, is that ""there’s a lot of money sloshing around without great places to put it, ” keeping the pressure on margins.""Careful what you wish for, ” Sosnick said. ""If you want easy money, the problem is it becomes plentiful, and if you’re the one who has it, it’s harder to get a good price for it.”Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital Markets said bank stocks should be bought on weakness because loan growth will come after companies and individuals use up their liquidity. What’s more, credit quality is strong and margins could improve next year as short-term rates rise. ""Combine that with increased loan growth, the revenue growth picture could turn out to be very positive for the banks in 2022, ” he said.One potentially positive catalyst are the pending results from regulatory stress tests, which could open the spigot for more dividends and buybacks. Analysts are confident the banks will have no problem passing. ""If the banks do well, as they’re expected to, the banks will start announcing dividend increases and share buybacks, ” said Arnold Kakuda, who follows bank stocks for Bloomberg Intelligence.""The ping-pong match continues between macro hopes and current fundamental realities, ” Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin said. ""Fundamentals matter -- until they don’t.” - Bloomberg"

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Business,,"Consumer, banking and tourism sectors to watch","SOME consumer, tourism and hospitality-related stocks have been on a tear over the last few months, as investors expect these industries to recover should vaccination programmes prove to be the elixir to the pandemic.This was despite stock markets around the world taking a dive after the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) hinted that the first interest rate hike could come faster than expected.The Fed is targetting at least one rate hike in 2023, and another five in 2024 after the central bank upped its gross domestic product (GDP) estimate for 2021 to 7%.The unprecedented outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020 and the measures put in place to curb its spread hit the tourism and hospitality sectors the hardest.A good indicator is the airline industry, which lost a lot of money last year.In the US, investors are hoping for a return to domestic travel, driven by vaccine rollouts and a slowdown in lockdowns.American Airlines’ stock has jumped 49% since the beginning of the year, while United Airlines has gained 30%, Delta Air is up 15% and Southwest Airlines has risen by some 23%.Back home, the local stock market has been on a downtrend since the beginning of the year.The benchmark FBM KLCI is down more than 3% year-to-date, closing at 1, 571.09 points yesterday.Some of the tourism-related stocks have outperformed the index. Shares in AirAsia Bhd have risen more than 5% since the start of the year, while Genting Bhd is up 13.4% and Berjaya Corp Bhd skyrocketing 52% this year.Meanwhile, Avillion Bhd, a hotel operator, saw its share price double from eight sen on May 31 to 17 sen on June 11, a day before the National Recovery Plan (NRP) was announced.Although these industries are unlikely to be fully operational by November, an analyst says the NRP provides a clear path of recovery for the economy.“However, political uncertainties have affected the market sentiment.“Retail participants have also declined compared to last year, as more investors are looking for clarity on the benefits of the NRP to the economy, ” the analyst adds.Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd head of equity sales Vincent Lau reckons that investors have already been looking at recovery-related stocks such as banking, oil and gas, plantation and tourism.He expects the stock market to pick up pace in the third quarter of this year as the recovery stage of the NRP takes place.“Despite having a clear roadmap from the government’s plan to fully open the economy by the end of October, there are still uncertainties, especially on the number of daily infections, ” he says.On a more positive note, he adds, “Overall, it is a good roadmap and the opening of the economy could be sooner than expected.”RHB Research analyst Soong Wei Siang expects consumer spending to recover sooner than expected in the second half of this year driven by a ramp-up in vaccinations from the third quarter onward.“Considering the current ultra-low interest rate environment with the overnight policy rate expected to be maintained at 1.75% for the rest of 2021, coupled with the assistance packages rolled out by the government, we think consumption will continue to be supported, ” he says in a report.Soong reckons that there are more opportunities in the small to medium-capitalised companies. But large caps have their attraction as well.“The larger-cap consumer names have strong defensive qualities which make them better positioned to mitigate against near-term market risks, ” he adds.Among his top picks for consumer counters include MR DIY Group (M) Bhd, Guan Chong Bhd, MyNews Holdings Bhd, Berjaya Food Bhd and Leong Hup International Bhd.But Kenanga Research expects the retail sector to remain under some level of stress.The research house points out that in the near term, consumer activity would continue to be weighed by the tightened mobility restrictions and the closure of non-essential services.“Nonetheless, we believe the impact would be less severe as consumers and businesses are more prepared with a greater shift towards online sales platforms, ” it says, adding that the situation is expected to gradually recover as the nation shifts to phase two and phase three of the NRP.CGS-CIMB expects investors to shift their portfolio in favour of recovery stocks in the period leading to the third phase of the recovery and Budget 2022.“The government revealed that it will have a supply of 16 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines by end-July.“When added to the current vaccine supply in the country of around 7.6 million doses, this means it will have at least 23.6 million doses of vaccines, sufficient to vaccinate 11.8 million people or 45% of the target population of 26 million to achieve herd immunity.“If these targets are successfully met, we expect investors to shift their portfolios in favour of recovery stocks, ” it said in a note to clients.Among its top picks are Malayan Banking Bhd, Genting Bhd and Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd.It added that Malaysia could potentially hold elections in Sarawak, which is due in September, and also the 15th General Election if the current political impasse is not resolved."
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Business,ROYCE TAN,Digital bank race heats up,"IT is less than a fortnight until the closing date of Bank Negara’s digital bank licence application and the heat it is generating is intense.Companies are now scrambling to meet the deadline of the application on June 30, which is just 11 days away. It is set to be a crowded race as the central bank will issue only up to five licences.Bank Negara has previously said that about 40 parties have registered their interests to apply for the licences, of which it is only looking at issuing up to five by the first quarter of next year.Only a handful of companies have openly stated their interests such as telecommunications giant Axiata Group Bhd, which is partnering RHB Bank Bhd; Sunway Bhd; AirAsia Group Bhd through its card-based money app BigPay; tech firm Green Packet Bhd; and the Sarawak state government.But as the deadline approaches, more names are starting to surface, including that of conglomerates who are not in the banking or financial services sectors.State-owned energy company Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is the heavyweight in the ring, after it emerged alongside other names such as Genting Bhd and New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea Ltd, which is partnering infrastructure conglomerate YTL Corp Bhd, according to recent reports.Sea is a Singaporean tech giant that holds one of the four Singapore digital banking licences. It also owns game developer Garena, Shopee and digital payment system SeaMoney.StarBizWeek gathers from market talks that other names which have since come to light are MyEG Services Bhd, a local investment bank, AEON Credit Service (M) Bhd, United States-based fintech startup MoneyLion and Malaysian fintech firm Soft Space Sdn Bhd.The fear of missing out is overwhelming, to the point a senior officer of Bank Negara has to remind all applicants to respect the application process.In a YouTube talk show by Fintech Fireside Asia on Thursday, the central bank’s financial development and innovation director Suhaimi Ali said there were “a lot of people trying to use connections” to get a headstart in the application process and he has laid down the final word – stop lobbying.“One message to all potential applicants out there is to stop lobbying. And because at Bank Negara, we abide by a strict governance process in assessing applications.“I would like all parties to respect that process,” he says.Suhaimi adds that there is a significant amount of interest from non-banks but regardless if a consortium is bank-led or not, each submission will be assessed equally.The red-hot interest in the digital banking space is understandable, considering that this could be the only type of banking licence that will be issued by Bank Negara, at least for now, more than 20 years post-Asian Financial Crisis when banks with smaller capitals were required to consolidate.Besides RHB Bank, it does not seem like other conventional banks are interested in applying for the licence, except for CIMB Group Holdings Bhd probably, which has been making great strides on the digital front through its wholly-owned subsidiary Touch ‘n Go Sdn Bhd, which owns 51% in TNG Digital Sdn Bhd, the joint-venture company with China’s Ant Group that runs the Touch ‘n Go eWallet.Unless the brick-and-mortar banks are open to explore partnerships on the digital front, they do not need a digital bank licence because they are allowed to digitalise their current operations using their existing licence.Meanwhile, MyEG, which is primarily involved in providing e-services for the government, confirms that it will be applying for a digital banking licence.In an email response to StarBizWeek, the company said it is applying as a part of a consortium, the composition of which will be disclosed at the end of the month.“At MyEG, we believe that technology can transform banking and financial services. With our 21 years of experience and track record in harnessing the power of technology to bring essential government services to the masses in the most reliable, efficient and affordable manner, we are confident that we are in a prime position to leverage our insights and expertise to do the same for banking.“Digital banking services would be complementary and synergistic as well as a value-add to MyEG’s range of existing e-government and commercial service offerings,” it says.MyEG adds that in aligning with Bank Negara’s objectives to provide banking services to the underserved and unserved markets, the group already has a long and established track record in engaging these very same markets, given its vast existing user base that spans all levels of society, income levels and age groups, with a geographical reach that stretches to all corners of the country, even to the rural and interior areas.Besides Petronas, it is learnt that an oil and gas services company is, or was, interested in joining the fray, at least until its auditors pointed out some matters pertaining to statutory audit.Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd, which was in the limelight recently over the accounting queries of about RM3bil transactions by its auditor KPMG, is also said to be among those wanting to apply, although its latest stance is not immediately known.The company declined to comment if it is planning to enter the digital banking space.While Reuters recently reported that gaming firm Razer Inc is considering applying, sources tell StarBizWeek that the Singapore-based company is not.In a media briefing on Berjaya Corp Bhd’s (BCorp’s) strategic transformation plan on Tuesday, group managing director Jalil Rasheed said Razer Fintech did look at digital banking but did not find the right partners to do it.Razer Fintech is the financial technology arm of Razer Inc, of which BCorp holds a 49% stake through its wholly-owned subsidiary Berjaya Fintech Sdn Bhd.It partnered BCorp in 2018 to roll out the Razer Pay e-wallet in Malaysia.MIDF head of research Imran Yassin Md Yusof tells StarBizWeek it is not surprising to see many parties from various sectors interested in this, as it gives them the opportunity to enter the banking space since it is very unlikely for new traditional banking licences to be issued.“With the proliferation of technology usage, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, we expect that digital banking has a bright future.“It also allows for the setting up of a bank without having to invest heavily in the cost associated with setting up a bank such as the cost to develop a branch network.“For those that already have some bank-like products such as e-wallet providers, it also means that more products can be offered and these parties can utilise the ‘deposits’ more efficiently,” he says.MIDF Research believes that digital banks will compete with traditional banks over the long term.“Having said that, it is not that traditional banks will not be competitive in the future as their existing licences already allow them to offer their products digitally.“The shift will likely be on how customers perform their banking needs and the strategies that banks employ to meet these needs,” says Imran, adding that the research house believes more customers will shift towards digital channels to perform their banking and it is likely this will lead to more branch network rationalisation, for instance.The most recent one came from HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd, which is closing down 13 branches in Malaysia by the year-end to focus on digital banking.In fact, if one were to take a step back to observe the industry statistics in Malaysia, it seems that banks are cognisant that their writings are on the wall if they do not change.Over the past 10 years, there has been an 11.14% decrease in bank branches from 2,055 to 1,826, a 20.74% drop in staff to 100,175 people and a reduction of automated teller machines (ATMs) and cash deposit machines by 29% and 82.5%, respectively, in the push for a cashless society.Vision Group managing director Chua Zhu Lian says corporations are looking into digital banking to pursue business diversification strategies, given that the Covid-19 situation has significantly impacted core businesses which has previously been thought of as resilient, even under worst-case scenarios.“There are also corporations that are looking to secure the licence to offer their users a more comprehensive set of services in order to strengthen their market position and expand their revenue streams into banking or financial services.“I believe conventional banks and new digital banks will co-exist as everyone in the ecosystem has an important role to play.“We will certainly see greater product innovations originating from both conventional and digital players, which will drive digital and financial innovations to greater heights, and this is extremely positive for our nation’s development,” said Chua, who is also the investment director of Fortress Capital Asset Management.Vision Group is a Sarawakian-owned company with a niche in banking and finance, technology and digital transformation.“We see great potential in Sarawak’s push towards a digital economy and are constantly finding opportunities to work with the state government and local businesses to accelerate the development of a highly agile and innovative digital economy in Sarawak,” he says.An investment banker says it is rather obvious who the five recipients would be, at least for the first round.“Naturally, it will be for those with deeper pockets first, those who can afford to fail in this pilot phase as the financial sector moves into digital banking.“After everything stabilises and when all kinks are ironed out, then probably Bank Negara will open up more licences and allow the smaller players to come in,” he says.Expect more names to be bandied about in this crowded space as the closing date draws nearer."

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Business,PANKAJ C. KUMAR - INSIDE INSIGHTS,Time for tax governance,"Tenaga Nasional Bhd received it, so did Magnum Bhd and AEON Credit Service (M) Bhd. UEM Sunrise Bhd too was given one, while its sister company, UEM Edgenta Bhd, could not escape either.Maxis Bhd, S P Setia Bhd, MK Land Holdings Bhd and Ecofirst Consolidated Bhd were also not spared as they too were in the news for the same matter.Of course, in all these listed companies, they were at one time or another, audited by the taxman. As a result, disputes had arisen on the quantum of taxes due and the treatment of certain types of income and/or gains. Penalties were then imposed by the tax authorities.With the government trying hard to generate as much tax revenue as possible, especially during these trying times, corporations need to ensure that they do have a clean bill of health when it comes to tax liabilities and application of the relevant laws.As we know, tax avoidance is perfectly acceptable, driven by cleverly structured tax policies, which are all within the ambit of the law. However, tax evasion is an entirely different thing and companies can run into trouble with the Inland Revenue Board for it.When listed companies are faced with high tax demand notices and this becomes public knowledge via announcements to Bursa Malaysia, stakeholders must have comfort that the tax function in the companies is managed well and professionally.Tax governance is now an area of greater importance. In fact, Dr. Veerinderjeet Singh, the president of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants and the Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is a strong proponent of this matter with the regulatory authorities and has spoken extensively at various public forums on issues related to tax governance.15% global tax rate is a game changerOne of the ways for a corporation to improve its tax governance is for all board of directors and/or audit committees to have an oversight over tax policies that are being adopted by entities. This is also in line with the various tax developments that are taking place internationally where there is demand for greater tax governance.As it is, two weeks ago, the G7 finance ministers adopted a uniform taxation system globally with at least a 15% tax rate. With this, although in Malaysia’s case the corporate tax rate is well above the rate, there could be cases whereby some of the Malaysian companies may have subsidiary companies that are domiciled in countries with a lower statutory rate or tax havens, and hence the demand for greater transparency among corporations is timely when it comes to tax matters.Since 2015, even the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has initiated a project called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), which is meant to address issues related to tax evasion and tax avoidance strategies that exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules in different countries to avoid paying tax.This is particularly so among multinational corporations where they are located in multiple jurisdictions where tax laws applied in one country would be different than another.According to the OECD, BEPS practices cost countries US$100bil-US$240bil (RM414.45bil-RM994.68bil) in lost tax revenue annually, which is equivalent to 4%-10% of the global corporate income tax revenue.The level of awareness among countries on this issue is rising and so far, over 139 countries and jurisdictions are implementing 15 actions to tackle tax avoidance, improve the coherence of international tax rules and ensure a more transparent tax environment.Taxes are also part of governanceFor Malaysia, the regulators have recently updated the Malaysian Code of Corporate Governance (MCCG) 2021, and one of the newly introduced practice is on sustainability and, of course, this is also in line with the environment, social and governance (ESG) framework that both the Securities Commission and Bursa Malaysia are increasingly focusing on for corporations to adopt.In fact, this is also in line with Bursa Malaysia’s own incentive of encouraging more companies to meet its strict criteria for inclusion into the FTSE4Good Index, which is now widely recognised as a benchmark index for ESG practices.However, one of the aspects of governance in ESG is related to tax transparency. Hence, the boards or audit committees too need to adopt an oversight when it comes to tax matters and to ensure that corporations are well within the ambit of the law when it comes to tax policies.In addition, Malaysia is a signatory to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which has 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and among others includes the capacity for tax and other revenue collection. What better way to show that Malaysia means business when it comes to SDG issues by having our corporations take tax matters more seriously and hence greater scrutiny of it.While board and audit committees can play an effective oversight role when it comes to tax matters and policies, it is also perhaps time to take tax governance more seriously by not only adopting them into a separate practice in future MCCG updates but also by introducing legislative measures that could make tax matters related to aggressive tax policies, which are not tied to commerciality, being treated as criminal offences.On disclosures, Bursa Malaysia could also introduce a tax compliance and risk statement under the integrated reporting framework to make boards and audit committees more aware of issues related to taxes and policies that are adopted.Hopefully, with the changing global environment when it comes to taxes, Malaysia too is ready to adopt these sweeping changes to ensure we remain in compliance with the relevant laws and practice of good governance.While the taxman may still call upon some companies, it is hoped such incidences are minimised so as to not create shocks to shareholders and other stakeholders. But that could only happen when companies have a robust tax risk policy and effective governance in place.Pankaj C. Kumar is a long-time investment analyst. The views expressed here are his own."
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Business,YAP MING HUI,Are robo advisers needed to achieve financial freedom?,"SINCE the introduction of robo advisers in Malaysia, it has been popular with the Millennials and Generation Z, who grew up in a tech-laden world.Nevertheless, the pandemic, during which large amounts of time is spent at home, is also beginning to stir interest amongst older investors who view robo advisers as an option for their investment portfolio. As such, this developing digital innovation warrants a pragmatic view of how it would fit in the ecosystem of one’s personal finance.A friend of mine recently asked for my views on robo advisers as an investment alternative. A businessman with three young kids, Mike was excited to jump in on the robo adviser bandwagon. He has already invested RM500,000 into a few robo advisers and is contemplating to pump in another RM2.5mil when we met up.What are robo advisers?In a nutshell, robo advisers are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven investment services with little to no human supervision.In Malaysia, the Securities Commission has classified robo advisers as a digital investment manager and issued licences to providers such as Stashaway, MyTheo, and Waheed.What proceeded was a long conversation between Mike and myself. We discussed the inner workings of robo advisers and whether it would be able to accommodate what he set out to achieve.According to Mike, robo advisers are cheaper alternatives to unit trust investments. By eliminating the presence of human advisers, robo advisers are able to offer the same services at a fraction of the cost.There are no sales charges compared to the 5% to 6% imposed by unit trust investment. He even countered that the annual management fee is only 0.5% compared to 1.5% for unit trust.Mike shared that he was taken in by the convenience of robo advisery platforms. It gave him access to diversify into global markets. Indeed, in the age of digitalisation, anyone with Internet access can perform transactions at the comfort of their own homes.The same cannot be said for traditional human advisers, who warrant a face-to-face meeting in order to transact.For example if a client wanted to execute a trade, he would have to call or physically meet with a financial adviser, explain his needs, fill out the required paperwork, and wait. Nevertheless, the increasing popularity of video-meeting facilities like Zoom changes things a little.Mike further shared that he does not require the services from a human financial planner anymore now that he has engaged a robo adviser.As a wealth management practitioner for the last two decades, I could certainly appreciate the benefits of using a robo adviser. From an affordability, accessibility, and convenience standpoint, it has merits. But, it should not be the only point of contention.Therefore, in the grand scheme of things, it is critical to be aware of the limitations of robo advisers.I in turn presented Mike with a few significant disadvantages of a robo adviser:>ETF has its performance limitationsMost robo advisers only invest in exchange traded funds (ETFs). From the best of breed fund manager selection perspective, ETFs have its own strengths and limitations.ETFs tend to perform better in certain developed markets like the US. In other developing markets such as China, Malaysia and other Asian countries, human investment managers generally perform better than robo advisers.Therefore investors who invest only in robo advisers will miss out on some of the best of breed funds available in certain markets.> Limitations as a fund managerRobo advisers are not ideal for investors who have a large sum to invest because they are not able to offer access to some of the major asset classes effectively. In Mike’ case, he has already invested RM500,000 in a robo adviser. To capture the opportunities of other asset classes, I suggested that he could, for example, diversify into real estate investment.We all know how popular physical property investment is with Malaysians. In fact, it is an important asset class that has the opportunity to provide investors with both capital gain and rental income. It is also possible to use mortgage loan as leverage as well.In addition, Mike may want to gain more exposure to an industry sector already accessed by his current robo adviser portfolio, for example, the technology sector.Therefore, Mike would need to find another investment alternative like unit trust or ETF, to get the extra exposure that he wants.In short, a robo adviser is just another fund manager playing the function similar to a unit trust fund manager.It has its strengths and limitations. As such I cautioned Mike that its performance should be evaluated regularly so that timely decisions whether to keep, sell or buy can be made.> No holistic and comprehensive financial planningDue to its rather confusing name, some people like Mike mistake robo advisers as digital financial advisers that are capable of replacing a human financial planner.The fact of the matter is, robo advisers are only but a subset of the entire financial planning ecosystem.Holistic financial planning is the comprehensive service which aims to manage and grow one’s wealth with high certainty by taking into consideration the following eight areas of wealth management – Investment Planning and Management, Risk Management and Insurance, Children’s Tertiary Education Planning, Retirement Planning, Asset Protection, Estate Planning, Debt and Loan Management and Tax Planning.If you were to compare the entire service offering of what financial planning entails, robo advisers at best only cater for the investment planning and management process.For matters pertaining to estate planning, risk management, insurance and debt management, Mike would still need to go to a traditional holistic financial planner as robo advisers cannot provide the convenience of a one-stop solution. Investors need to be fully aware of the implications of choosing one over another.> No customised adviceEarlier we have established that robo advisers are at best another investment or fund manager.Therefore, robo-advisers are incapable of providing customised advice, especially when there is a need to look at the client’s wealth in a holistic and unique manner.Its failure to capture the full picture of a client’s financial assets and liabilities, pales in comparison to a human financial planner, who strives to get to know their clients comprehensively to provide customised financial and investment advice.> No personal touchFinancial and investment decisions very often have emotional and psychological effects on an individual and a robot can never deliver the empathy and understanding of its human counterpart.Relationship building and connection are what we as humans generally desire. It is also one of the core essences for professionals who run a financial advisory business.Clients find assurance and value in having a professional sounding board to guide them through their money and investment matters. However, with robo advisers, you will find that the total hands-off approach (lack of human touch and empathy) can be somewhat cold and unsupportive psychologically.A robo adviser will not hold your hand and talk you off the ledge after a significant market drop. In comparison, a human financial adviser is there to assuage your fears, explain how the investment markets work and suggest the right actions to take.>Lack of coaching to take higher risk for higher returnIf you are a low-risk investor, you’d have parked all your earnings in a savings account and/or in fixed deposits. In order to increase the investment return of your money, you need to learn to take and live with higher risks.Robo advisers don’t normally provide one to one risk coaching services. A holistic financial planner who is competent, and experienced can effectively guide an investor to get out of their comfort zone to take higher risk and help manage the risk along the way.“A good decision is based on knowledge, not on numbers.” ~ PlatoAs you can see by now, robo advisers are at best another investment option in a sea of investment opportunities. It won’t replace a human financial planner, especially the competent and experienced ones.I hope my sharing of the conversation in this article can also help the readers have a better understanding of what a robo adviser can and cannot offer in your personal financial planning and management.Yap Ming Hui is a licensed financial planner.

For example, S P Setia Bhd reported that sales for the first quarter of 2021 were encouraging despite the weak market sentiment,” says PublicInvest Research.Acorus at Setia EcoHill 2 in Semenyih was launched via a special online preview, which saw its double-storey terrace units (20ftx65ft) being fully taken up before Chinese New Year.Following this success, Acorus 2 was launched in March and 70% of the units were taken up on the first day of its launch.The latest phase of Setia Alam‘s Bywater Homes collection in Shah Alam, Plenum, also received overwhelming response from its online launch in mid-March, as all its double-storey units (22ftx70 ft) were fully booked within an hour.More recently, Glades of Westlake (with a gross development value or GDV of RM156mil) – which is the second last island phase of Setia Eco Glades in Cyberjaya – was launched towards the end of March.The project saw almost 70% of its double-storey semi-detached homes (41ftx85ft) priced from RM1.8mil and bungalows (59ftx85ft) priced from RM3.1mil being booked within just three weeks of its launch.PublicInvest Research also points out that based on recent National Property Information Centre (Napic) data, the residential overhang situation has improved slightly with 29,565 overhang units worth RM18.9bil recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 (with a further decrease of 0.3% quarter-on-quarter or q-o-q in the first quarter of 2021), a drop of 3.6% in volume.Meanwhile the “unsold-under construction” and “unsold-not constructed” numbers also improved, dropping to 71,735 units (2019: 72,692 units) and 12,975 units (2019: 16,774 units), down by 1.3% and 22.6% respectively primarily due to the cautious stance of most developers in launching projects, as most were focused on clearing inventories.Separately, in the fourth quarter of 2020, planned supply increased by 0.8% q-o-q but was 2.6% lower year-on-year (y-o-y).Johor still has the highest number and value of overhang in the country with 7,030 units worth RM5.48bil, accounting for 23.8% and 29% respectively of the national total.Meanwhile, Selangor (4,889 units), Perak (3,637 units) and Kuala Lumpur (3,023 units) are among those states with the highest overhang.In terms of value, the second highest was Selangor (RM4.29bil), followed by Kuala Lumpur (RM2.92bil) and Perak (RM1.16bil).By type, condominium/apartment formed 51.9% (15,354 units) of the national total overhang, followed by terraced houses (28.1% or 8,306 units).The research unit notes that in the first quarter of 2021, residential sales improved by 26% y-o-y but eased 6% q-o-q.Despite loan approvals dropping by 17% y-o-y, loan applications were steady with a 2% y-o-y increase, suggesting property demand is still healthy though financing is still difficult given the economic stress.The ratio of loan approvals against loan applications for the purchase of residential property stood at 35% in 2020 versus 43.2% in 2019. Interestingly, residential loan applications for January and February 2021 started with an increase of 62% and 2% while residential loans approved moved up 26% and 15% respectively, indicating positive buying momentum.PublicInvest Research also points out that riding on recovery hopes, the property sector has outperformed the benchmark FBM KLCI by more than 5% year-to-date, primarily on positive tailwinds on low mortgage rates, impending economic recovery, Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) initiatives and various stimulus measures by the government.The property sector is currently trading at an undemanding 71% discount to the book value.The research unit also notes that the property sector is now increasingly being consolidated, dominated by a few large property players with land banks that have a GDV potential of almost RM100bil.“We estimate that the top-seven developers alone have more than 70% of the market share in Malaysia out of more than 1,000 property developers.“The big developers could benefit the most if the sector rebounds going into next year with their scale advantage and well-located land banks with low holding costs.”PublicInvest Research has upgraded its stock call to an “outperform” on S P Setia (target price RM1.25), Eco World Development Group Bhd (target price 98 sen) and Sime Darby Property Bhd (target price 79 sen).It also has “outperform” calls on IGB Bhd (target price RM2.70) and LBS Bina Group Bhd (target price 69 sen)."
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Business,,Some commodities have now wiped out all of their 2021 gains,"FOR all the talk of a commodities boom, some markets have now wiped out gains for the year and several more are close to doing so.Soybean futures have erased their 2021 advance, sliding more than 20% from an eight-year high reached in May. Corn and wheat have also tumbled from multi-year highs.The Bloomberg Grains Spot Subindex slid the most since 2009 on Thursday. Other commodities that saw big rallies evaporate include platinum, while once-surging nickel, sugar and even lumber have faltered.The fact that some commodities markets are falling while others – including crude oil and tin – are holding gains underscores how unevenly the complex is responding to economies reopening and expanding once again.While those materials have climbed on strong demand fundamentals, others face their own unique headwinds, such as an easing supply worries in soybeans and monetary policy uncertainty in the case of gold and silver.Some materials also took a hit this week on China’s efforts to slow inflation and Federal Reserve signals for interest-rate increases, with the US dollar rising and the Bloomberg Commodity Index set for its worst week since the start of the pandemic.“Risk-off is front and centre thanks to the hawkish words from the Fed, which came on the back of the Chinese government-led directives over prior weeks, ” said Michael Cuoco, head of hedge-fund sales for metals and bulk materials at StoneX Group. “Central-bank stimulus helped the markets gather steam in the spring of 2020, and now there is a bit of a macro reset.”PullbackEven some of the markets that are clearly benefiting from the reopening are seeing a pullback, with copper heading for its worst week in more than a year. The cool-down in many raw materials comes after the Bloomberg commodity gauge reached multi-year highs. Analysts including those at Trafigura Group have said tight supplies and rampant demand point to the possibility of another supercycle – an extended period during which prices are well above their long-term trend.A gauge of the US dollar extended gains on Thursday after climbing the most in a year on Wednesday, making commodities less appealing to investors holding other currencies. A big backwardation in many commodities and seasonality accounts for some of the recent slump as futures contracts roll over.China has stepped up its campaign to rein in prices and reduce speculation in a bid to ease the threat to its economy from soaring raw-materials costs. The country’s top economic planner on Thursday reaffirmed its intention to cool commodities, and said it will release metals from state reserves in a timely manner to push prices back to a normal range.Also hurting prices of many agricultural products has been improving weather in growing regions. Recent beneficial rains have corn futures on track for the steepest monthly decline since 2011 and for soybeans since 2016.Getting whiplash“The volatility we are seeing now is all about weather, ” Stephen Nicholson, a senior analyst for grains and oilseeds at Rabobank, said in a phone interview on Thursday. “Over the last few weeks you just get whiplash from day to day.”The slump in many resource prices deepened this week after Fed officials sped up their expected pace of policy tightening, fuelling worries that the US central bank would soon pare stimulus that’s helped spur stellar gains in metals, agriculture and energy.Still, energy and industrial metals, which have gained from bets that reopening economies will stoke demand, are still well above where they started the year, and some analysts say the rally is unlikely to fade significantly.“We believe we are in the early innings of a decade long strong cycle in commodities, similar to the cycle that took place from the late 90’s through 2008, ” said Jason Bloom, global market strategist for Invesco, which oversees US$1.4 trillion (RM5.8 trillion) assets for clients.“The supply constraints are relatively insulated from the language of the Fed in a given meeting. China can push around prices in the short-term by releasing reserves, but they don’t control markets.” — Bloomberg"
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Opinion,FONG MIN YUAN,Late surge dispels correction fears,"REVIEW: The FBM KLC remains in a sideways trading channel, capped by uncertain market sentiment, despite a strong rebound yesterday. However, the positive performance helped to dispel fears of further declines as the index had exited below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) just a day earlier.During the first half of the week, the FBM KLCI stayed afloat of the 200-day SMA, which investors had clung to following a correction in the first week of May.At market open on Monday after three consecutive sessions of losses, the moving average served as a platform for bargain-hunting activity, alleviating some of the selling pressure on the local market.It was only a brief reprieve, however, as the consolidation phase remained firmly in place with subsequent profit-taking taking the index lower over subsequent days.There was some anticipation over the government’s late-Tuesday announcement as the National Recovery Plan offered more clarity on the lockdown plans. However, it failed to generate excitement among investors, given that its rollout was, rightly, dependent on the decrease in the number of daily coronavirus infections.The start of Phase 2 of the plan requires the number of daily Covid cases falling below 4, 000. Yesterday, the number of daily coronavirus infections remained elevated in the mid-6, 000s.Compounding the selling pressure in equities, the US Federal Reserve signalled at the end of its monetary policy meeting that it might be raising interest rates sooner than many had anticipated.Given the rapid pace of recovery in the US economy and rising inflation, the central bank hinted that it could make a return to higher lending rates as soon as 2023.The news came as unexpected as observers believed the current spike in inflation was temporary, coinciding with the sudden reopening of the economy.Reacting to the possible end of easy money, foreign funds retreated from riskier assets while the ringgit fell against the US dollar. Over two days, the ringgit shaved half a percent against the greenback to 4.14.The downside to sentiment was clearly reflected on Thursday’s price chart as the FBM KLCI shed 7.46 points to 1, 570.86, its lowest close in nearly a month.Yesterday, there was some bargain-hunting as investors struggled to return the index above the 200-day SMA. A surge in buying in late-afternoon trading saw the FBM KLCI ending the day with a firm performance, 18.19 points higher at 1, 589.05.Statistics: The major index ended the week 13.89 points or 0.8% higher over the previous Friday at 1, 589.05. Total turnover for the trading week stood at 28.12 billion shares amounting to RM18.25bil compared with 22.95 billion shares worth RM13.07bil in the previous four-day trading week.Outlook: The FBM KLCI managed to return above the 200-day SMA in a convincing fashion in late trading yesterday. However, the index remains caught within a narrow trading channel below the 1, 600 psychological resistance.In the coming week, investors could be looking to cash in on profits from the sharp surge in the recent session.The advance, however, helped to dispel notions that the FBM KLCI was due to resume its correction. Should the buying interest resume after a brief period of profit-taking, there could be an attempt to cross over the 50 and 100-day SMAs overhead, in an attempt to reach 1, 600.The slow-stochastic is looking healthy, having inched over the 50% mark while the 14-day relative strength index is looking more bullish at 57 points.The daily moving average convergence/divergence line, meanwhile, is inching higher past the signal line although a more convincing crossing would be needed to confirm a “buy” signal.The 200-day SMA continues to offer support while more significant support can be found at 1, 560."
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Business,LIONEL LAURENT,The house always wins in online gambling,"THE return of international football tournaments in front of a live crowd is worth cheering, with the star power of Cristiano Ronaldo and Kylian Mbappe bringing fans out in droves to bars and pubs eager to make up for a lost pandemic year.Less cheerful is the fact many fans remain glued to their screens wherever they are judging by the boom in online gambling fueled by the easy smartphone betting and seductive advertising that captivated many during lockdown.With awareness of mental health, stress and the public-health costs of gambling addiction on the rise amid Covid-19, it’s a cue to consider whether current rules are tough enough.Having a captive audience with cash to spare has been good for business: France, whose national team is the bookmakers’ favourite to win the UEFA EURO2020, posted a record €2.2bil (US$2.6bil or RM10.66bil) in online sporting bets in the first three months of the year.The UK, Europe’s top online gambling market, is also breaking records with events like the Grand National horserace. Shares of Ladbrokes owner Entain Plc and lottery operator La Francaise des Jeux have soared on rising profits.Yet if the camaraderie of a tentpole sports event is increasingly linked to quick-fire bets everywhere, it’s also thanks to a flood of breezy promotions, ads, time-limited bets and celebrity sponsorships that incite people to bet with few reminders of the risks.Persistent warningsWhile a mix of rules and voluntary restraint from the operators themselves are supposed to keep things in check, it’s time to heed persistent warnings from public-health experts that children and problem gamblers aren’t being protected enough.The content of these ads can cross the line: One recently-scrapped betting campaign in France depicted a young winner carried aloft through his neighborhood as his elders respectfully kneeled before him. But even less egregious ads give off unrealistic vibes of skills-based windfalls that hardly reflect reality. Industry heavyweights’ gross margins of more than 40% show the house has a tendency to win. “If you’re playing more, you’re losing more,” Ladbrokes’s former boss said last year, adding that 99% of his customers lost.Branding and advertising that aim to normalize gambling and sports betting have succeeded through ubiquitous logos and tweets. Measures like a voluntary “whistle-to-whistle” ban on in-match television advertising in the UK, where the industry spends £1.5bil (RM8.2bil) a year, mean little next to social media and team sponsorships. Top psychiatrists have warned it’s a public-health risk reminiscent of tobacco ads.Operators are keen to promote what their business gives back to the economy: The European Gaming and Betting Association says its members in 2019 held 145 licenses across the continent and invested €107.1mil (RM543mil) in sport sponsorships.That won’t go unnoticed post Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo sees sports betting as a way to boost tax, while huge losses racked up by the likes of the UK’s Premier League will need filling.But at a time when athletes are becoming more outspoken over the products they sponsor, and as social attitudes even in bet-friendly Britain are hardening against glitzy gambling promotions, momentum is likely to build behind tougher rules.Focusing solely on education and research to preserve individual responsibility isn’t going to cut it when data suggests the problem gambling could affect almost 1.4 million Brits.Outright banAn outright ban on gambling advertising, as seen in Italy, isn’t likely to see wide take-up and might work better as a threat than reality.But a ban on gambling sponsorships of sports teams, approved in Spain and under review in the UK, could gain traction. Right now, too much responsibility lies in the hands of individual clubs that can’t easily afford to turn down £5mil to £10mil (RM29mil to RM59mil). Norwich City recently ended its deal with online casino BK8 after fan uproar over the company’s sexualised marketing materials.Gambling companies might protest, but they may also appreciate a releveling of the marketing playing field against rivals.But the real pressure, as sports-marketing expert Richard Denton of the Johan Cruyff Institute points out, will be on the soccer teams whose attempts at pulling other revenue levers (such as the Super League) haven’t always worked.When the Formula 1’s tobacco sponsorship ended in 2005, it sparked a business-model revamp to make up for the shortfall. Other sports will need time and support to make similar changes.Any new rules should be imposed carefully, and fairly, but given the social harms at stake, they’re worth a punt. — BloombergLionel Laurent is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Business,EUGENE MAHALINGAM,Mall operators need to innovate to grow footfall,"THE Covid-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way a lot of industries have had to conduct their business, with the retail sector being no exception.Deloitte, in its paper “The future of the mall: Building a new kind of destination for the post-pandemic world, ” notes that the pandemic has shocked the retail industry.“Shopping malls, once popular meeting hubs that were already feeling the pressure from e-commerce and decreased foot traffic, were suddenly devoid of customers as the world locked itself down in an effort to contain the virus’s spread.“One thing is certain, our retail experience is about to be revolutionised, ” it says.One industry observer concurs that retail operators will certainly have to “start thinking outside the box” to pull in the crowds.“While the pandemic is still far from over, mall operators will need to come up with innovative and unique ways to increase the footfall at their premises.“There is a need to build confidence in the shopper that malls are still a safe and convenient place to convene.”No doubt, this will be a tall order, considering that social distancing has become the new normal.Deloitte says retailers and mall owners have been investing in their digital and e-commerce capabilities to elevate their brand and customer experience even before Covid-19 is clearly poised to come out ahead.With the pandemic, Deloitte notes that today’s shoppers are demanding a safe, frictionless environment.“The consumer’s needs and shopping habits after Covid-19 will be in constant flux as their emotions battle opposing forces, namely the desire to get in and out quickly; and the need to be social and interact with one another.”Deloitte says the key to getting shoppers back into malls will be for owners and retailers to work together to invest in customer safety and to provide tools and applications that make for a smoother, more convenient shopping experience.“There has been a rapid rise in the popularity of convenience services such as self check-out, click-and-collect, curbside/store-door pickup, buy-online-pickup-in-store and free or hassle-free returns through services like a centralised returns area in the mall.“Curbside delivery emerged during the Covid-19 crisis as a way for shops and major chains alike to continue to provide products to customers while making safety a priority.”Deloitte emphasises that malls can no longer be purely about shopping.“For daily essentials such as grocery, bakery and pharmacy, consumers increasingly prefer one-stop shop destinations.“As the restrictions imposed to protect public health during the pandemic are eased, people will likely be craving more social interaction.“If their functional needs are being met close to home, malls themselves will need to build broader, more dynamic experiences that people can’t find elsewhere.”Deloitte says landlords and retailers will need to collaborate creatively to drive foot traffic and boost dwell times to increase their revenue productivity.“Retailers need to take a page from digital-first companies. It’s never been more important to build a seamless omnichannel brand presence.“Customers are increasingly looking for a digitised experience both online and off, enabled by technological innovation at every turn.“Malls and retailers need to use digital tools to maximise productivity and efficiency and create a dynamic, engaging experience.”But most of all, Deloitte says malls must become the new meeting place for the community, namely a multi-purpose destination that offers extensive leisure activities as well as other functions, like office, residential, and cultural amenities.“Shops should be mixed in with other complementary uses, giving visitors an interactive experience in which the entire environment comes into play.“Owners may need to rethink their rental models to allow for different types of retail experiences, such as short-term pop-ups or exhibitions.“There is a great opportunity here to be innovative, ” it says.Meanwhile, Retail Group Malaysia (RGM) has revised downwards marginally its 2021 growth forecast for the industry to 4% from 4.1% previously.The revision is in light of the re-introduction of the movement control order (or MCO 3.0) on May 3, as well as the national lockdown on June 1.The first phase of the lockdown, which was supposed to last for two weeks until June 14, has been extended for another two weeks until June 28.RGM managing director Tan Hai Hsin warned that any extension would have an adverse impact on the local retail industry.“Any extension of the two-week lockdown will damage the retail industry further. Any delay on the re-opening of non-essential retailers after two weeks will lead to more closures, ” he says in RGM’s latest Malaysia retail industry report.Tan also says the second-quarter (Q2) growth estimate of 18.4% given by members of the Malaysia Retailers Association and Malaysia Retail Chain Association is no longer attainable.A large majority of retailers gave their estimates before the announcements of the MCO 3.0 and lockdown. In addition, Tan says RGM is revising the growth rate for Q2 of 2021 from 7% to 5.6%.“The Malaysian government will continue the lockdown beyond the two-week period with revised movement restrictions and ban on the opening of certain retail trades. Retail sales during Q3 of 2021 will be affected as well. RGM revises the growth rate from 4.1% to 3.5% for Q3, ” says Tan.Additionally, he notes that the interstate travel ban is expected to be enforced for a longer period of time and will severely affect domestic tourism spending.“Travel bubbles with selected countries will likely begin towards the end of this year. Malaysia will witness rising foreign tourist arrivals only from the first half of next year.”Tan adds that vaccinations on the majority of the population will take a while.“Thus, movement restrictions and social distancing measures will remain until the end of this year.“RGM expects the retail industry to begin its gradual recovery by the end of this year.“For Q4 of 2021, the retail industry is expected to grow by 12.7%, ” he says."

It’ll also curb U.S. inflation pressures at a time when prices are rising faster than expected.""That’ll be a rational choice, ” Mei, who works at the ministry’s Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said in an interview in Beijing. ""By cutting tariffs, it can not only help the U.S. ease their inflation pressure, but can also benefit U.S. consumers.”With China the top exporter to the U.S., lower tariffs would mean reduced inflation imported from China, Mei said, allowing policy makers there to keep monetary policy loose to support that economy’s recovery.However, easier monetary and fiscal policies will inevitably result in faster growth in imports from China, Mei added, which could worsen the trade imbalance between the two countries. The widening U.S. trade deficit with China was one of former president Donald Trump’s main arguments for imposing tariffs at the time.""A loose monetary policy and a more balanced trade with China can’t be achieved at the same time, ” Mei said in the interview Tuesday.Trade TalksThe two countries are slowly resuming official contact under the Biden administration, with China’s Vice Premier Liu He holding separate calls with U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in recent weeks.However, the signals from the two sides differ, with China saying the meetings showed normal communications have started and the two countries are pushing forward trade and investment ties, while Tai said recently there’s still ""significant imbalance” in the trade relationship.Mei pointed to the U.S. domestic political environment as another hindrance to future trade talks.For trading partners that are considering negotiating with America,""U.S. society seems very divided, ” Mei said. ""If the deal proposed can’t be passed within the U.S., then is it still meaningful for America’s trading partners to talk to the U.S.?”The phase one trade deal signed between both countries in January 2020 left in place higher tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of U.S. imports from China, and also on some U.S. exports to China. So far, Beijing has made only incremental progress in meeting the targets under the agreement.Mei said China’s failure to keep up with the scheduled pace of its purchases is partly because the U.S. can’t produce and ship goods fast enough.""We should respect objective economic laws when making any negotiations or deal, ” he said. - Bloomberg"

""We knew we could do better.""The task was to present ourselves in a different way, especially in attack. From the beginning we wanted to show the Portuguese players we want to win and we do not want to lose.""The victory moves Germany, who face Hungary in their final game, into second place in the group on three points, a point behind leaders France and level on points with the Portuguese. Hungary drew 1-1 with France earlier on Saturday.Loew also praised forward Thomas Mueller for making sacrifices for the team by defending all over the pitch and making runs that opened up space and chances for others.""Thomas did a lot of runs and didn't create so many opportunities or the chance to be clinical but he opened up spaces and defended well,"" Loew said.""He worked well for the team. His position was to start pressing situations and stop the attacks.""Portugal grabbed an early lead against the run of play before Germany stormed back thanks to two own goals in the first half and second-half strikes from Kai Havertz and Robin Gosens.Loew expected a tough game against a Hungary side likely to sit back and defend but he looks to have all his players at his disposal after slight niggles he described as muscle problems forced three substitutions -- including Mats Hummels, Gosens and Ilkay Gundogan-- as a precaution.""That is why we had to undertake those three substitutions,"" he said.

We just wanted to press the midfield players - Gundogan and Kroos -- and we wanted our full backs to drive forward,"" Santos told a news conference.""But it was clear to see that we were always short of an extra man in the midfield and were pushed back. It was my strategy and I'm fully responsible for it.""In the first half, they suffered just two fouls. If we can't stop them, if we have issues having possession, then we have problems.""Germany's left wing-back Robin Gosens also tormented the Portugal defence with his speed and power and capped a memorable individual display with a goal and an assist.While Santos pointed at a number of individual defensive mistakes throughout the match, he refused to blame his players for the defeat.Portugal face group leaders France in a rematch of the 2016 Euro final, knowing their progress in the tournament remains uncertain.""The players should have been able to cover the right hand side. But I don't want to blame them,"" Santos said.""Whether we progress or not is still up to us.

(Reuters) - Perennial major contender Louis Oosthuizen sank a monster eagle putt at the final hole to vault into a three-way tie for the lead after the third round at the U.S. Open on Saturday.South African Oosthuizen's downhill 50-footer slammed into the middle of the flag and toppled in to add another layer of fascination to what already was shaping up to be a compelling final round Sunday at Torrey Pines.With a one-under-par 70, Oosthuizen joined surprising Canadian Mackenzie Hughes (68) and steady American Russell Henley (71) at five-under 208.But the three frontrunners did not have to look far over their shoulders to see heavyweights Rory McIlroy (67) and Bryson DeChambeau (68) waiting to pounce just two strokes behind.Pre-championship Jon Rahm (72), despite a double-bogey, is among a trio three behind.Thirteen players in all are within four shots of the lead.Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open champion, has completed the career runner-up grand slam, and just last month was equal second behind Phil Mickelson at the PGA Championship.Now he has another chance but knows it will take something special.""There's a lot of great players up there that have a chance of winning this, and I just need to go out and play as good as I can tomorrow,"" he said.Henley started the day tied for the lead with Richard Bland, and maintained at least a share of it the entire day.""I'm 32, I don't know how many more good years I have of golf left,"" said the three-time PGA Tour winner. ""I'm excited, and you always wonder what it would feel like or be like to be in contention.""He will find out soon enough.Hughes, meanwhile, vaulted into contention by holing a 60-foot eagle putt at the par-five 13th that prompted an enormous gallery roar that reverberated across the canyons to the rest of the course.In uncharted territory, he did not even attempt to downplay the situation.""You get goosebumps thinking about it, so I know I'm going to be nervous tomorrow,"" he said.""I essentially played today around the lead all day. I think I was only ever a few back the entire day. I think it'll feel different tomorrow being in that last group, but you do the same things.""BLAND'S RUN HALTED, NO MICKELSON GRAND SLAMWhile Hughes surged, halfway co-leader Bland's fairytale run came to a screeching halt. The 48-year-old who recently became the oldest winner on the European Tour, battled to a 77 that left him six behind.McIlroy, seven years removed from the most recent of his four major titles, could hardly ask for a better chance to end his drought.""I'm trying to think of the last time where I really felt like I had a chance,"" said McIlroy, who had to go back to the 2018 British Open where he tied for second.""I'm just excited for the opportunity to have a chance.""Defending champion DeChambeau, meanwhile, ignored a smattering of minor heckling to pound his way into contention with another bone-jarring performance of long driving.He compiled his first ever bogey-free round at an Open, picking up three birdies and coming ever so close to making a few more.""You've got to be really patient out here at these majors,"" he said.""It's something that is not easy to do. My first few goes at majors, I was not successful or anywhere near successful, and I feel like I'm starting to understand major championship golf and how to play it and how to go about managing my game, my attitude and just my patience level.""If I can continue to do that tomorrow, I think I'll have a good chance.""Mickelson, a record six-times U.S. Open runner-up, saw his bid to complete the career grand slam disappear for another year after a sloppy five-over 76 left him at seven-over.Playing a month after becoming golf's oldest major winner at 50 by claiming the PGA Championship, Mickelson could not produce the same magic in his home town.(This story corrects Hughes details at 13th hole, in paragraph 13)(Reporting by Andrew Both; Additional writing by Steve Keating in Toronto, reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Ken Ferris, Daniel Wallis and William Mallard)"

But its vaccination programme has been slow and the medical system pushed to the brink in parts of the country. The government's drive to hold the Games has been criticised by hospitals and doctors' unions.Underscoring the concern, a Ugandan athlete arriving in Japan for a preparation camp ahead of the Olympics late on Saturday was found to be infected with the virus, public broadcaster NHK said.Athletes will be shuttled in and out of the village and be tested for the coronavirus every day. Olympic rules ban singing and chanting during events and require athletes to wear masks at all times except when outdoors, sleeping or eating.The shopping area of the village features an automatic teller machine, dry cleaner, post office, bank and courier counter.""Where you can see bare light bulbs, we'll install lanterns to give the area a bit more of a traditional Japanese feel,"" Yoshie Ogawa, a director at the Tokyo 2020 marketing bureau, said at the start of the media tour.The wooden plaza, which draws on Japanese minimalist design aesthetics, follows the Tokyo 2020 theme of using timber in the construction of Olympics venues, including the National Stadium.The 2.4 billion yen ($21.8 million) shopping area was made from 40,000 pieces of timber donated by 63 Japanese municipal governments. Each donated piece is marked with the name of the area that provided the wood.After the Olympics, it will be dismantled and the timber returned to the donating cities for re-use in local facilities.The apartment complex abutting the shopping plaza was built on reclaimed land, and designed to house about 12,000 people in 23 buildings. It includes shops, a park and a school. The buildings will be converted into flats after the Olympics.The development of the housing project cost the Tokyo government 54 billion yen, including road work and infrastructure.Organisers were originally planning to feed residents of the village in vast dining halls – the largest with a capacity to seat 4,500 people.But now, organisers will ask athletes to dine alone, maintain social distancing with others, and wipe down surfaces after eating to curb the spread of the virus.($1 = 110.1900 yen)(Reporting by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

They didn't want to make mistakes. They were playing safe, square, backwards. They weren't aggressive enough,"" he told Sky Sports.England were hailed by pundits after their 1-0 opening Group D win over Croatia while Scotland faced questions after a 2-0 loss to the Czech Republic in Glasgow, but the roles were reversed after an excellent display by Steve Clarke's team.""I think Scotland played angry, hurt from the criticism of the first game.

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",2:08 AM MYT,Sport,,Soccer-Germany bounce back with statement 4-2 win over Portugal,"MUNICH (Reuters) -Three-times European champions Germany shrugged off their opening game loss and announced their arrival as serious contenders at Euro 2020 with an emphatic 4-2 win over highly-rated Portugal in their Group F match on Saturday.The Germans had been beaten by world champions France in their opener prompting serious questions over their ability to make a challenge in this tournament but Joachim Loew's side responded to the pressure with an outstanding performance.Cristiano Ronaldo had given the defending champions a 15th minute lead with his 107th international strike but Germany went in at the break 2-1 up thanks to own goals from Ruben Dias and Raphael Guerreiro.The Germans turned on the style in the second half with efforts from Kai Havertz and the impressive Robin Gosens making it 4-1 before Diogo Jota pulled a goal back for Portugal.The result throws the 'Group of Death' wide-open and gives Germany a strong chance of progressing to the last 16.Germany, who face Hungary in their final game in Munich, move into second place in the group on three points, a point behind leaders France and level on points with the Portuguese. Hungary drew 1-1 with France earlier on Saturday.It was not merely the result that suggested some pundits were wrong to write off Germany - the fluency of their passing, the killer crosses and the intelligent running was a reminder of the enduring qualities of German football that has delivered so much success on the biggest stages.""Overall it was an outstanding performance from the team, great attitude, great spirit, we had many chances, outstanding,"" said Loew.STRONG STARTGermany started with purpose and confidence and thought they had grabbed the lead in the fifth minute through Gosens but VAR ruled that Serge Gnabry had been in an offside position.Against the run of play, Portugal grabbed the early lead, hitting the Germans on the break with Bernardo Silva picking out Jota on the left of the box and his low cross was tapped in from close range by Ronaldo.It was the Portugal skipper's third goal in two games and his first ever against Germany but Joachim Loew's side kept their cool and continued to play positive football before eventually getting their reward.The Germans drew level in the 35th minute when Joshua Kimmich's cross from the right was volleyed at the back post by Gosens and flew into the net off the outstretched foot of Portugal defender Dias as he looked to stop Havertz converting.It was another own goal that gave Germany the lead -- Kimmich drove in a low ball from the right and Guerreiro's attempted clearance flew past his goalkeeper Rui Patricio.Portugal replaced Bernardo Silva with Renato Sanches at the break but Germany took a firm grip on the game with a third goal six minutes after the restart -- a well-worked passing move ending with Havertz turning in a low ball from the left delivered by the influential Gosens.GERMANY BUZZINGGermany were buzzing now and it was no surprise when they made it 4-1 on the hour with Gosens finishing off another well constructed attack, heading home a Kimmich cross at the far post.Portugal struck back quickly though when a deep free-kick from Guerreiro looked to be heading out but Ronaldo acrobatically hooked the ball inside to Jota who slotted home.Sanches fired a warning of a potential comeback when he thundered a long distance drive against the woodwork but Germany's victory was never really in doubt.The threat from the wide areas was particularly impressive with Gosens dynamic on the left and Kimmich impressive on the right while Havertz's ability to ghost into space was never neutralised by the Portugal defence.""We wanted better movement up front. From the start there was tempo, good combinations, from the wings with Kimmich and Gosens... that was our plan and it worked,"" said Loew.Despite a 3-0 win over Hungary in their opening game, Portugal's progress to the last 16 is not secure and they need to take something from their final game against France in Budapest.""Anyone can progress. This group was always very strong,"" said Portugal coach Fernando Santos. ""Whether we progress or not is still up to us. And we must respond to this.""(Reporting by Simon Evans; additional reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris)"

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",2:40 AM MYT,Sport,ABHISHEK TAKLE,Verstappen delivers the unexpected with French GP pole,"(Reuters) - Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen pulled off the unexpected on Saturday when he snatched a comfortable French Grand Prix pole for Red Bull at a track that had until now been a happy hunting ground for rivals Mercedes.The Dutchman, who leads Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton by four points in the overall standings, was in a league of his own around the 5.8-kilometre Paul Ricard circuit.His lap of one minute 29.990 seconds made him the only driver to breach the 1:30 barrier and was good enough to beat seven-times world champion Hamilton by 0.258 seconds.Verstappen's qualifying display followed an even more dominant showing in final practice earlier on Saturday when he lapped 0.747 seconds quicker than Hamilton’s team mate Valtteri Bottas, who qualified third for Sunday's race.“I knew it was going to be better than the last time we were here but this good I didn't expect,” said Verstappen after taking his second pole position of the season and the fifth of his career.“This has traditionally not been an amazing track for us but to be able to put it on pole here, of course we're super happy about that.”Mercedes have been dominant at the track at Le Castellet in southern France since it joined the calendar as host of the returning French Grand Prix in 2018.The team topped every practice and qualifying session for the 2018 and 2019 races, with Hamilton going on to win both from pole. The race did not take place last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The reigning champions had hoped the venue would set the stage for a return to form after disappointing outings at the last two races in Monaco and Baku.“It's been a difficult weekend because we are just lacking pace,” Mercedes boss Toto Wolff told Sky F1.“It looked much worse than in the end where we ended up but we just need to gain everywhere.”For Red Bull, it proved that their speed around the street layouts in Monaco and Baku had carried over to the more conventional layout of Paul Ricard, after having been beaten by Mercedes at similar venues in Portugal and Spain.Verstappen is hopeful he can get the job done and deal Mercedes their first defeat at the circuit on Sunday.“I’m so confident that we can have a good race car anyway, so it’s going to be a long race. It will be a tight battle but I’m looking forward to it.”(Reporting by Abhishek Takle; editing by Clare Fallon)"

She failed to deliver the times some had expected but got the job done, qualifying in four individual events the 200, 400, 800 and 1,500, which will be contested by the women for the first time at the Olympics.""It's been fine. I haven't been super happy with my times but still feel like I'm in a good spot,"" Ledecky told reporters after the trials. ""Mission accomplished.""""It's not easy to get through the yardage I got through this week. It was good to just do it and get the job done, check the box move forward and not get too caught up in times.""The gold medal winner in the 800 at the 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, Ledecky has ruled over the event for nearly a decade, posting the top 23 times of all time.There was never a moment on Saturday when that domination was in doubt as Ledecky left the field in her wake powering to victory in a time of eight minutes, 14.62 seconds - almost six seconds clear of 15-year-old Katie Grimes, who also earned a ticket to Tokyo with her second-place result.While it was business as usual for Ledecky, the evening also provided a major upset when Regan Smith, the 200-metres backstroke world record holder, finished third. She will not race the event in Tokyo.Smith had not been in top form coming into the meet but was still expected to grab one of the two spots. Instead it was Rhyan White getting to wall first in 2:05.73 ahead of Phoebe Bacon.Smith, however, had already secured her ticket to Tokyo with a win early in the 100 back.There were no slip-ups in the men's 100 butterfly, where world record holder Caeleb Dressel powered his way to a commanding win ahead of Tom Shields.After flirting with his own world mark of 49.50 in the preliminaries and semifinals, Dressel was expected to attack the record, but without being pushed he won in a time of 49.87.Dressel has now qualified in two individual events - the 100 butterfly and 100 freestyle - and is likely to add third to his work load in Japan after posting the top time of 21.51 seconds in the 50 freestyle semifinals.(Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto; Editing by William Mallard)"

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,Sport,,Toiling Harry not leading England by example,"LONDON: Harry Kane (top) is England’s captain, chief goalscorer and talisman, which is great when things are going well, but when the striker is off the boil, as he was horribly again against Scotland, his sluggishness seems to permeate the whole team.England were desperately short of ideas, invention and energy, managing a solitary shot on goal in a 0-0 draw that was a just reward for a Scottish team who were the exact opposite, making up easily for a supposed gulf in class with their commitment and organisation.On Sunday, Kane was taken off late in the 1-0 win over Croatia, looking out on his feet, with some suggesting the hot conditions may have played a part in his sluggish display.On Friday, on a wet, cool night he looked even worse and was hooked after 73 minutes of largely purposeless toil.In the first half he sat deep, as has become his more normal position for his club Tottenham Hotspur, but was unable to find a way to influence the game either in collecting the ball or moving it forward.Kane pushed up more after the break but was handled with ease by Scotland’s central defenders.There can be few players whose standards swing so dramatically, seemingly dependent on their fitness. As England were bundled out of Euro 2016 by Iceland, Kane played as if he was carrying a bag of cement on his back.Two years later he was the leading scorer at the World Cup, his goals and all-powerful front-running display driving England to the semi-finals.Back on home soil, however, he again looks slow and on Friday he was unable to bring his influence to bear in any way.Pundit Graeme Souness said Kane looked “a shadow of the player we know he is. He looks leggy, he doesn’t look himself, he looks jaded... he needs to wake up.”Manager Gareth Southgate replaced him with Marcus Rashford, having also thrown on Jack Grealish after an hour, but they were the only changes he made despite the team seemingly desperately needing a shake up.England managed one shot on target all night – a decent effort by Mason Mount – and though John Stones hit a post with an early header, they rarely otherwise looked like unlocking an impressive Scotland defence.Far too many players took the easy, safe option and, though England were right to try to dampen the frenetic early exchanges as the fired-up Scots tore into them, they failed miserably to use their increased possession to do anything more than spray the ball laterally.The result is no disaster for England, who have four points in the bag ahead of their final game against Group D leaders the Czech Republic on Tuesday, but the performance should worry Southgate.He is not a man to panic but, as he has become more established in his position, that calmness has too often developed into a conservatism that has left fans and pundits scratching their heads.Unless Kane is carrying an injury he is almost certain to lead the line against the Czechs, and beyond, but if England are to have any chance of going deep into the tournament, their number nine will need to rediscover that lost verve, or make way for someone who still has it. — Reuters"

He worked very hard and on top of that he was a constant threat up front as well. That is exactly what we needed today.""The 26-year-old Gosens, who has played his entire professional career outside Germany and unusually has not come out of the country's youth system, was one of the best in their opening defeat against France but had faced a tighter backline.Against the Portuguese, he had free rein to display his full set of skills and live up to the title of his autobiography 'It is worth dreaming'.The Atalanta defender was crucial to Loew's plan to attack more often and faster than in their opener, and his constant runs gradually gave forwards Kai Havertz and Serge Gnabry more space to operate inside the box.Gosens did not take long to ignite, thundering in a flying volley in the fifth minute before his effort was ruled offside, but in an almost identical move he volleyed into the box in the 35th to force Ruben Dias to stab the ball into his own goal.The defender, a psychology student in his spare time who prefers books to video games, kept up his frenzied runs, remaining a constant source of concern for Portugal's defence.He set up Havertz for Germany's third goal six minutes after the restart, cutting back for his team mate to tap in.Gosens was the key to Germany turning the game around with three goals from the 35th minute until he headed in to make it 4-1 on the hour and cap a memorable performance.By the time he scored Germany had had 11 attempts on goal, compared to just two in the entire game against France, and most of those started with Gosens.The Germans could now seal their spot in the next round when they face Hungary on Wednesday.(Reporting by Karolos Grohmann; editing by Clare Fallon)"

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Metro,,An alternative to double-masking,"The recent spike in Covid-19 cases worldwide should not be taken lightly as the new variants are more infectious.Even with the vaccination roll out, wearing a face mask is still considered a necessity as the virus continues to mutate.Double-masking has become a topic of conversation to enhance protection by improving filtration.It also fits more closely against the face for a better seal.However, one of the disadvantages of double-masking is poor breathability which will cause frequent removal of the mask and hence, increases exposure.ProXmask is the better alternative to double-masking and it also has an added advantage.Designed and engineered with ProX technology, ProXmask is able to inactivate 99% of SARS-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19, other coronaviruses as well as influenza viruses and bacteria.The antiviral technology involves the presence of active positive charges on the fabric, as binding sites for viruses.Upon contact with the fabric, virus cells that are negatively charged are neutralised, leading to the rapid destruction of its glycoprotein layers.ProXmask is also water repellent, offers better breathability and enhanced microfiltration technology, achieving above 95% BFE (bacteria filtration efficiency) and PFE (particle filtration efficiency) versus 85.4% in double-masking.Its water repellent feature enables effective shielding from respiratory droplets containing viruses and bacteria.It is washable and reusable up to 60 times, which makes it an environmental friendly product.ProXmask is also the first fabric mask in Malaysia to obtain product certification from Sirim QAS International.It also carries CE marking for the European Economic Area and is US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) registered.Those interested in becoming a ProXmask distributor and sales agent can email info@proxmask.com or visit www.prox.com.my"

SEKARAN,Light at the end of tunnel,"THE Bukit Kukus paired roads – one of the most difficult projects both in design and construction – will only be completed by the end of this year.Penang infrastructure committee chairman Zairil Khir Johari said work was progressing well and the project would be completed in December, two months later than the earlier October deadline.“Yes, it is one of the most difficult road projects to build but we have overcome all major obstacles, which have been identified and rectified, ” he said.Zairil said while there were several delays since the project began in 2018, the estimated cost would remain the same at RM545.6mil.In a press conference in early April, Zairil had said geological fault lines were discovered at certain sections of the hilly area of the project, contributing to its delay.He had said since the issue needed to be rectified, the project, which was originally scheduled to be completed in May, would be pushed to October this year.The project consists of three sections.Penang Island City Council (MBPP) is responsible for the construction of 2.8km of the stretch that costs RM275.6mil.Two more developers are responsible for the remaining 1.4km (RM150mil) and 0.7km (RM120mil) stretches.The works include the junction improvement of Lebuhraya Thean Tek, widening of the existing Jalan Bukit Kukus, construction of new roads and an elevated road from Jalan Paya Terubong to Jalan Tun Sardon and an intersection of new paired road to Lebuh Bukit Jambul with a dedicated right-turn ramp.Several slope mitigation projects along Jalan Tun Sardon were also completed.On the maintenance of the project after completion, Zairil said it would most likely come under the Public Works Department as MBPP was only the project implementer.“A final decision on this will only be made after a discussion with all parties, including the state government.”Zairil, however, added that any defects of the project would be the responsibility of the contractor since there was a two-year liability period.The project had its fair share of mishaps since it began in 2018.In October 2018, 14 beams meant to be a platform for a section of the highway fell, leading to the Department of Safety and Health issuing a stop-work order.Two days later, a landslide mangled 12 container cabins, killing nine foreign workers and injuring four.The main contractor for the project, Syarikat Yuta Maju Sdn Bhd, was fined RM35, 000 in February last year for failing to provide a safe work procedure.Meanwhile, state Fire and Rescue Department director Saadon Moktar said his personnel visited the site recently to look at the work in progress.“It was merely to survey the area and how rescue operations could be carried in the event of a major accident.“We are still studying all the angles and the safety measures, ” he said.Saadon said they briefed the contractor on the objective of the visit and also made some recommendations on safety measures to be taken."

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Metro,ANDY CHUA,Senior citizen overcomes her fears to get Covid-19 shot,"SHE is 84 and despite her earlier reluctance, Lo Yat Lang realised that getting vaccinated against Covid-19 was her best option.While she had initial fears of discomfort and pain when getting the jab, the Sibu Benevolent Society resident was also well aware of the benefits of getting inoculated.“I was uneasy about receiving the vaccine, but took it anyway.“I read about the pandemic almost every day as we receive the Chinese newspapers here, ” said Lo after getting her first shot.A nine-member mobile vaccination team from the state Health Department was despatched to the home to inoculate 28 residents between the ages of 57 and 89.Lo, who has been at the home for more than 10 years, is in good health but sometimes needs a wheelchair because of her weak legs.Like others at the home, she always wears a face mask, although there are times when she finds it hard to breathe.Home vice-chairman Robert Chew said the residents were supposed to be vaccinated in April but it was postponed because of the lack of vaccines.“That month, the senior citizens underwent a health check to determine whether they were eligible.“However the vaccination did not take place. So they went through another health check in late May.“We had requested that the residents be inoculated at the home instead of at a vaccination centre, as it would be difficult for us to look into their needs while travelling.”Chew said most of the residents had comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes.The 11 workers at the home had been vaccinated in March.A spokesperson for the mobile team said they had covered five homes for the aged, the other four being Rejang Nursing Care Centre, Love Care Centre at KPJ, Apha Home Centre and the High Q Senior Enrichment Centre."

The first was a children’s daycare centre.He reminded operators of such homes that they could only get a licence to operate after the facility had been inspected for fire safety and cleared by the local authority and district health office.“These centres must also get approval from their neighbours if they are operating within a housing area.“There is an urgent need for such care facilities among the community but there are not enough government-approved ones.“The public is left with little choice as it would be dangerous to leave elderly folk and young kids unattended while their parents and caregivers are at work, ” said Hee, who is also state tourism and environment committee chairman.While the elderly care home in this case had acted quickly to contain the spread of the virus, there was a high possibility of unreported cases at illegally operated centres, he said."

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Metro,VENESA DEVI,Nod to state’s third stimulus package,"The Johor government’s latest economic stimulus package has received the thumbs up from various groups, and is seen as “timely assistance” during this lockdown.Johor Tourist Guides Association chairman Jimmy Leong Wie Kong said the one-off initiative for tourist guides, homestays, budget hotels and travel agencies based in the state was a reflection of the government’s commitment.“We thank the state for looking after the welfare of the tourism industry here during these trying times.“This initiative would not have materialised if there were no consultations between industry players and the state government, ” he said.Leong also thanked Johor tourism, youth and sports committee chairman Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi for continuously engaging with the industry.Johor Indian Petty Traders and Small Business Association chairman D. Ravindran said the one-off incentive for canteen operators, barbers, budget hotels, small and medium enterprises as well as school van and bus drivers was among the initiatives that would benefit its members.He also welcomed the assistance under e-Kasih, the RM200 vouchers for those in the B40 group and the Gerobok Makanan food aid programme.“The rent exemption for those living at people’s housing projects and deferment of business licence fees until December are much appreciated too, ” he said.Ravindran added that while he was grateful for the RM500 one-off initiative for some 10, 000 people who had lost their jobs, he believed that the actual number was much higher.“We are of the opinion that the figure is over 10, 000 and the state should do what’s necessary to get more accurate statistics, ” he said.Meanwhile, Johor Malay Non-Governmental Organisations Coalition Council president Zaini Atan said the economic stimulus package was timely, especially with the extension of the lockdown.“We also welcome the state’s move to buy its own vaccines to expedite efforts to achieve herd immunity, ” he added.Leong echoed his views, saying: “Johor is unique because of its proximity to Singapore and its economic interdependence with the island republic.“So getting the population here vaccinated early is particularly important for the state.”Last week, the Johor government unveiled its third economic stimulus package worth RM241mil as part of efforts to step up its Covid-19 pandemic management initiatives and provide financial relief to the people.Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad had said that the Ihsan Johor 3.0 financial aid package with 33 initiatives, was aimed at empowering the state’s management of the pandemic and strengthening the social safety net.Since the first movement control order in March last year, the state government has allocated a total of RM550.95mil through three economic stimulus packages, benefitting over 1.5 million recipients."
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,Metro,SHALINI RAVINDRAN,‘MPAJ did not send official invite to discuss anaerobic digestion plant project’,"THE association managing a Hindu cemetery in Ampang that complained about a proposed anaerobic digestion (AD) plant project next to it, has claimed that the local council did not discuss matters with it.Hindu Cemetery Crematorium Ampang Association said Ampang Jaya Municipal Council (MPAJ) did not inform the relevant parties about the plans to build the plant and a food court in Jalan Kerja Ayer Lama.The AD’s location is in front of the 60-year-old Ampang/Ulu Kelang Hindu Cemetery in Kuala Lumpur.The site is currently the parking facility for cemetery visitors.The food court is set to be located less than 50m away from the AD plant.Association secretary Saradha K. Suppiah (pic) said MPAJ did not inform the association about the plans nor called the committee for a meeting as claimed.“MPAJ had only addressed a letter to a worker at the cemetery instead of sending an official notice to the committee about a meeting last year to discuss this proposal.“How can this be when we have had many correspondences with MPAJ over cemetery matters since 2012? We are the rightful party that should have been notified.“How are we supposed to voice our concerns or objections when we have not even been informed in the first place?” she questioned.Saradha said the cemetery was established by her late father, K. Suppiah and it was gazetted in 1962.Besides the cemetery, Suppiah was also instrumental in building the Sri Raja Rajeswary Temple, Ulu Klang Recreational Club (UKRC) and SJK(T) Ampang.Saradha said they were not aware of the AD project until the hoardings were installed at the site and construction started at the end of May.“We have sent an official letter to MPAJ requesting a meeting on this matter.“Until then, MPAJ must put a hold on the project,” she said, adding that the burial ground would be temporarily closed for upgrading and maintenance works.MPAJ had said the AD was one way to tackle excessive food waste by processing it into compost for fertiliser and the biogas produced would generate electricity.A StarMetro report on June 14 quoted MPAJ press relations officer Norhayati Ahmad saying that a coordination meeting for the development of the food court and AD plant was held on July 7 last year, and was attended by the affected parties.She had said that no one objected to the project and all agreed to share the parking facilities, adding that the AD would take up 22% of the 0.15ha land.Norhayati said the RM4.56mil project was currently in the initial stages of construction by MPAJ, in collaboration with the Housing and Local Government Ministry.In 2019, the AD project was proposed to be in Jalan Mamanda 27, next to Kondominium Kojaya Ampang, but it was changed last year to its current location following residents’ protest.The food court will house traders currently operating in Lorong Kerja Ayer Lama.Meanwhile, former Cabinet minister Tan Sri Dr Rais Yatim, who has been an Ampang Jaya resident since 1975, called on MPAJ to provide information on the project to residents in all neighbourhoods in the area.“It is not just the immediate community who are affected. It is only right that all residents are consulted,” said Rais who is Dewan Negara president.He said MPAJ should address everyone’s concerns about the project, especially over any potential dangers of the AD plant.MPAJ councillor R. Moganraj has planned to arrange a meeting among all concerned parties after the lockdown is lifted.Ampang MP Datuk Zuraida Kamaruddin, who is also Housing and Local Government Minister, was reported earlier as saying that the project was expected to be completed by January next year.The new food court will have 17 stalls and two kiosks, toilet, nursing room, surau and carpark."
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Metro,AIDA AHMAD,Anchor of the family,"Fathers are making the most of trying times to connect with their children and strengthen bonds. StarMetro shares the joys and challenges these men face in conjunction with Fathers Day tomorrow.FATHERS Day is more than just an occasion to get dad a new tie or treat him to a nice meal.For some, when reflecting on the best gift they could have given their own fathers, the common response is “quality time spent together”.Devoting precious moments together is even more important now with the Covid-19 pandemic in our midst, as strong paternal ties with children are precious and needed. The challenges, however, are immense, especially for fathers who are heads of the household or even single dads.Tough loveFor Yong Yek Ming, 56, being a parent to two autistic sons Wei Jie, 21, and Wei Xiang, 20, has changed his perception of fatherhood.“It is definitely much more challenging being a single father.“To me it is ‘parenthood’ because I was brought up in a family where men and women are equal at home.“My mum was a strict parent and I did household chores as well.“There is not much difference between a single father and single mother because both have to do more for their children, ” he told StarMetro.Taking care of one autistic child is equivalent to caring for 10 children, said Yek Ming, a divorcee.Wei Jie, is non-verbal while Wei Xiang has high-functioning autism, both in the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).“I have to spend more time with Wei Jie because he is prone to temper tantrums and needs to be taught skills like toilet training and preparing food.“My objective is to make him independent so he can take care of himself but he requires long-term care.“The worst case scenario is getting him a caregiver in future, ” he added.Yek Ming, an engineer by training and a businessman, said it was imperative to create more awareness of autism in society.During the early stages, he said it was difficult as he would get rude looks and comments from the public whenever he took his sons out.“I was put off by it. I received comments like ‘if you cannot control your child, stay at home’.“But in 2015, I made up my mind to open up about autism, ” he said.It was then that Yek Ming and his sons became part of the inspiration behind award-winning Malaysian movie Redha in 2016, directed by Tunku Mona Riza.The movie was selected to represent Malaysia in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 89th Academy Awards in 2017.It tells the story of a family’s struggle to confront the harsh realities of raising a child disabled by a condition they knew little about.For children with autism, quality time is a subjective term, said Yek Ming.“My sons are happy to get more time with me.“The problem is I cannot get them to socialise with other people because they lack social skills and I cannot keep them at home too long either, ” he said, adding that if it was not for the lockdown, the boys would be learning life skills — cooking, handling household chores and managing money — at Parents Resource 4 Autism Centre in Sri Petaling.How does Yek Ming cope with a dual-parent role?“I cannot be as good as a mother in some aspects, ” he said.“Mothers have innate love and compassion.“But for me, there is no separation between the roles of mother and father.“If a father does not know how to cook, he can learn from YouTube now.”Recalibrating prioritiesBeing a single father for Afif Afham Arsad, 38, means reassessing how minutes are spent in a day.When he was married, the former pilot was free to focus on his career, find a side hustle and had more time for activities with his children Mikael, 12, and nine-year-old twin daughters Thalia and Tianna.“But it’s interesting how limitations and difficulties teach me perspective and focus.“Being a single father, I have managed to dig up extra minutes in a day.“I love that I can bring my children along in my journey of work and design, involving them in the process.“Sometimes, the insights from them actually match the feedback I receive from my peers, ” he said.Afif Afham was forced to change careers, from being a pilot for 17 years to a user experience/user interface (UX/UI) designer, because of the Covid-19 pandemic.While he can easily focus on learning something new from scratch on his own, he chooses to get his children involved in his new career.“I taught them design while learning it myself, and incorporated design-thinking elements in their schoolwork and game time.“To see them putting all these non-traditional education elements together is so heart-warming, ” he said.Afif Afham highly values the routine of running his household along with his children.“We don’t call it chores.“It’s just things we need to do to maintain a home filled with love.“For example, if I say ‘shut it down’ at about 7pm, the kids set the house up for night-time.“It’s like having a personal assistant but with chubby cheeks to pinch, ” he joked.Being a single parent is also about having good mental health.“I’m wired differently so I cannot parent like others, ” he explained.“I am grateful that my children and I are on the same frequency about this.“I use my design elements and purposeful games to educate them about critical thinking and resilience (in life).”But he admitted that sometimes his professional and parenting responsibilities could get overwhelming and test his patience.“It definitely does break me every now and then but it is just smart to accept reality and recover quickly, ” he said.Afif Afham’s message to all single fathers is to have a clear goal in life.“My life decisions are centred around my children’s well-being and safety.“There were overseas job opportunities last year that my friends thought I should grab quickly but those offers meant I had to be apart from my children so I declined.“More importantly, get all the help you can when you need it.“My family has been extremely helpful.“Parenting is not about being a flawless homemaker.“A child’s marinara-stained white shirt when cooking together has more value than an Instagram-worthy dining table, ” he said.Newbie daddyAfter his soon-to-be two-year-old daughter Liberty came into his world, Rithan Vijay, 41, learned to appreciate things he had forgotten.Fatherhood, so far, has been a rollercoaster ride of emotions.“I am still learning something new every day.“I have this new sense of responsibility, which I never had before, and I am constantly reminding myself it’s not about me anymore, ” said Rithan, adding that sacrificing frequent meet-ups with friends was part of the package of being a new parent.Rithan, who does freelance work from home, is also a musician and former talent division head at Astro.He said there is no manual for fatherhood.“It is just like music, you learn the rules and then you improvise.“I just pray that I can be the best person I can be for my daughter, ” he added.The pandemic has given him a chance to spend more time with Liberty.“I am grateful for this and I try to adapt to what she likes to do.“We watch cartoons in the mornings — our current favourites are Lucas The Spider and Minuscule.“She helps me feed our cat, dog and fishes and she always wants to complete tasks on her own.“It’s like having my own personal helper, ” he laughed, adding that most of the time, she likes reading, colouring or painting.“My wife deserves the utmost respect because it’s not easy being on demand 24/7.”Rithan said he now values time and feels a fierce kind of love he never thought existed.“I want to shield this little person from the evils of this world, although I know that is impossible.“I got to know my self-worth and moved away from things which do not make me happy anymore, ” he said.“I have to be well in order to set a good example for my daughter.”"
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Metro,JAROD LIM,Let’s have uniform rules for all traders,"Morning and night market traders in Kuala Lumpur have been facing one uncertainty after another since the movement control order was first implemented in March 18 last year.With the government’s standard operating procedure (SOP) often lacking clarity, these traders feel that they have been left out.During the MCO last year, only indoor markets were allowed to stay open.To soften the blow, open-air traders were given RM500 under the Wilayah Cakna initiative by the Federal Territories Ministry.At that time, market traders understood that it was necessary to close in order to flatten the Covid-19 infection curve.The problems started during MCO 2.0 in January, when outdoor markets were allowed to open but night markets were closed.Night market traders could not understand why they had been sidelined as both markets operated under seemingly similar SOP.The Kuala Lumpur Night Market Association appealed the ban, which the government lifted in February with the condition that night markets would have to strictly comply with the SOP.This continued until the latest lockdown that began on June 1.According to the National Security Council’s (NSC) SOP dated June 2, all markets are allowed to operate from 6am to 2pm, subject to the local authority’s approval.In the case of Kuala Lumpur, it was decided that while indoor markets could operate, outdoor markets would remain closed.The move by Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) has not gone down well with the affected traders, who lament that in Selangor, outdoor markets are allowed to open.To make matters worse, even roadside traders in Kuala Lumpur, who are registered under the free trading zone programme introduced by Federal Territories Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa, have been allowed to operate.Their reasoning is simple; if roadside hawkers are allowed to operate, why not outdoor and night markets?After all, organisers of both markets had adopted a stricter SOP even before the lockdown, which included hiring People’s Volunteer Corps (Rela) personnel, implementing one-way traffic flow and making temperature checks and MySejahtera registration compulsory.It is only logical that markets adopting the same SOP be treated equally.Many traders I spoke to expressed their unhappiness over what they called “double standards”.Most market traders survive on their daily earnings, and missing even a week of business would greatly affect their income.Endless appeals to allow outdoor and night markets to open have been channelled to the relevant authorities.However, the indisputable fact that Covid-19 infections must be reduced urgently continues to drown out their voices.While market traders may seem rebellious in their push for the decision to be reversed, what they actually want is to be treated fairly.As a start, NSC should come up with a clear decision on whether outdoor and night markets should be allowed to open, instead of leaving it to the respective local authorities.This will ensure that all states are on the same page.Local authorities can, however, be in charge of ensuring these markets comply with the SOP, failing which they will be ordered to close.Kuala Lumpur Night Market Association secretary Charles James Roy recently suggested that DBKL allow night market traders to operate on roadsides (similar to hawkers under the free trading zone programme) as it should be workable and would improve their livelihoods.A better strategy should be taken by the government in regard to market operations.Should there be another lockdown, the plight of market traders, both outdoor and indoor, must be taken into consideration.Meanwhile, four mobile vaccination trucks will make their way to Pasar Borong Kuala Lumpur tomorrow to vaccinate traders and workers there.Some 1, 000 people at the wholesale market will benefit from the programme under the FT Ministry.This also spells good news for business operators who will feel more safe when getting their supplies from the wholesale market."

Those involved have to do their screenings and get the results, so that we can make a decision if the premises should be closed, or opened after consulting the Health Ministry.“We will also close premises when we find people do not adhere to the standard operating procedures (SOP).“In fact, we have closed a few markets since the first movement control order.“It is not an easy decision to make but we have to do it. The health of the public is of utmost importance, ” he said.Since March last year, several public markets including at Taman Free School, Batu Maung and Jelutong on the island and in Penaga, Bagan Ajam and Bukit Mertajam on the Penang mainland had been closed temporarily after Covid-19 cases were detected.Meanwhile, MBPP mayor Datuk Yew Tung Seang said the MBPP pig slaughterhouse in Jalan Sungai was allowed to reopen yesterday..Also present were Jelutong MP RSN Rayer and Batu Lanchang assemblyman Ong Ah Teong."

"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,Metro,R. SEKARAN,Sigh of relief with lifting of enhanced MCO rule,"RESIDENTS who faced the enhanced movement control order (MCO) in Pekan Bayan Lepas, Penang, are thankful that the two-week strict order has ended, but some are now worried if they are still employed.Lorry driver Tan Lye Tatt, 45, who transports sand to development sites, is unsure whether he still has the job because his employer has not told him yet.“I am happy that the enhanced MCO has ended. At least it gives us freedom to move now as it was like ‘house arrest’, being cooped up in our apartment unit in Bayu Nyaman.“My wife and mother are also glad that the restriction has ended, but now I have to go out and look for a job and besides driving a lorry, I am not familiar with other types of jobs,” he said yesterday.Tan hopes his boss will recall him because his savings are nearly depleted.Food delivery rider Karthik Manuvel, 19, said he lost several hundred ringgit in income during the strict lockdown.“It was tough. My brother and I take care of all the expenses at home and my brother, who works in a logistics company, might also have a pay cut for the two weeks of staying home,” said Karthik, who lives with his parents who are daily wage operators in a factory.During the enhanced MCO, Karthik said his family did not dare leave the house after knowing about the high number of cases in their neighbourhood.Ridhuan Mohd Mydin, a storekeeper, had his spirits high even though his company terminated his services and he now has to look for a new job.“I only joined the company for two days when the lockdown was imposed on June 4. My boss said they could not keep me as business was slow.“Anyway, the restriction is lifted and I can go out to look for a job,” added Ridhuan, 28, who lives with his parents and sister in Bayu Tiara Apartment.Petty trader Mohd Aswad Jaafar, 38, observed that residents in the enhanced MCO zone were cooperative in following the standard operating procedure (SOP).“We knew what we were getting into and the only way to stay safe was to stay home,” he added.Mohd Aswad expressed gratitude for the aid given by the state and non-governmental organisations during the period, adding that many of the residents there are in the B40 group.Balik Pulau MP Wan Muhammad Bakthiar Wan Chik estimated that more than RM100,000 worth of food and household essentials were distributed in the area over the last two weeks.“At least 2,400 packs of food items were given to the people and their cooperation in heeding to the SOP was crucial in stopping the spread of coronavirus in their neighbourhood,” he said.The enhanced MCO was imposed on Sri Bayu, Bayu Tiara, Bayu Nyaman, Halaman Murni, Bayan Permai, Bayan Tiara, Taman Ara Indah, Kampung Bukit, Kampung Perlis, Kampung Masjid, Jalan Mahkamah, Kampung Pak Lah and Lebuh Kampung Bukit.It affected over 10,000 residents.The decision to impose the enhanced MCO came after health authorities recorded 83 new cases within two weeks with the total number of positive cases exceeding 250.The Health Ministry in a statement said the enhanced MCO was lifted at 11.59am yesterday at all 13 localities upon completion of the 14-day strict rule.The ministry said it had completed 3,582 Covid-19 screenings in the area and confirmed that the number of cases had reduced, new clusters were under control and those who were infected had received treatment."
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,Metro,,Food court deserted as people remain at home,"THE food court on the upper floor of the central market in Sibu is one of those most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The numerous closures of the market since February this year has left a greater adverse impact on the food court than the wet and dry markets on the ground floor.Food stall operator, Lai Lee Siew, 52, lamented on the situation.“We had no income when the market was closed. Although we are now allowed to operate, it is still very hard for our business to survive as people don’t want to take the trouble to come upstairs just to tapau (buy takeaway) food and drinks from us,” he said.Lai said most of the operators preferred to just stay at home rather than waste their time opening their stalls because business was poor.“Of the more than 100 stalls, on average there are only 10 stalls still operating.“And those who are still open for business find it very hard to pull in customers as it looks like people are deserting our food court,” he said.Illustrating how bad the situation was, he cited a drink stall operator who said that he could hardly make RM10 a day.“We are only allowed to operate on alternate days these past few weeks.“As I had a heart operation recently, I chose to take the time to recuperate rather than open my stall as there is no point since business is bad,” said Lai.Life for petty traders like him has been tough since the outbreak of the pandemic.“We used to enjoy brisk business.“I can only hope that the situation gets back to normal because we don’t know if we can survive more difficult times if the situation prolongs,” he added."
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,Metro,VIJENTHI NAIR,‘No direct deliveries to high-rise units’,"DELIVERING packages, parcels and foodstuff directly to the units of residents in high-rise buildings is against the Covid-19 standard operating procedure.Instead, such items must be dropped off at an area designated by the building management for self-pickup.Delivery personnel had been found bringing items straight to the recipients without knowing that they were breaking the rule, said Housing and Local Government Ministry strata management division enforcement unit head Insp Mohammad Izzat Hassan.“Courier service personnel are not allowed to go up to apartment units in stratified residential buildings to make deliveries.“Some management of such buildings in Subang Jaya have allowed delivery riders and courier service personnel to go up to the specific unit to make the delivery, which is against the SOP,” he said, adding that this practice was not only a health risk but also a threat to the residents’ security.Insp Mohammad Izzat said people’s movement had to be controlled to curb the spread of the virus, while being vigilant with regard to criminal activities.“The security guards may not know if the person claiming to make a delivery is being truthful, or a criminal in disguise,” he said.He was speaking with reporters after heading a team to check on SOP compliance at a residential high-rise in Petaling Jaya. The group was accompanied by Petaling Jaya City Council’s (MBPJ) Commissioner of Building (COB) unit.The enforcement team has been collaborating with local authorities to conduct random checks on high-rise properties since the start of the lockdown on June 1 to ensure SOP compliance.Insp Mohammad Izzat said that although building management offices might have the approval letter to function as an essential service, the police and local authorities would still go to the ground to check on compliance.On adherence to SOP at high-rise residences, he said it was generally good but there was confusion over how delivery and courier services could operate within such premises.Insp Mohammad Izzat said no compounds for SOP violations were given so far at stratified buildings, specifically because the violations were due to confusion.“Other aspects such as no physical meetings, closing of public areas such as gymnasium and swimming pool were adhered to at all the properties we checked to date.“However, some compounds were issued to the management for general SOP violation, namely for allowing visitors and employees in without scanning the MySejahtera app,” he said, adding that the number of compounds issued were not available yet.MBPJ COB director Jayanthi Kupusamy said they had identified 10 stratified residential buildings to be included in the first phase of random SOP-compliance checks.She said there were 1,264 stratified residential schemes in Petaling Jaya managed by developers, joint management bodies, management committees or management agents, under the city council’s purview.“We are checking two aspects, which are general SOP compliance such as the use of face mask and observing physical distancing, and stratified building SOP compliance which entails providing the tools for temperature checks, registration of visitors and the MySejahtera QR code.“We are also checking their operations approval letter and if they have correctly registered all their employees.“There are instances where names of residents were included in the list, which is not allowed.“I hope the exercise will increase awareness and serve as a lesson to other stratified management schemes to abide by the SOP and help the country flatten the Covid-19 infection curve,” she said."

"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,Metro,RENA LIM,Penang prepares for mass screening,"THE mass testing programme to pick and test 1,000 individuals at each state constituency in Penang is expected to begin on July 1 after the method is finalised.State local government committee chairman Jagdeep Singh Deo said the mass testing will be carried out across 40 state constituencies where 1,000 people from each constituency will be picked for the testing.The programme involves the stages of registration, testing operations and post testing.“One of our moves under the programme is prioritising testing at hotspot areas.“The state Health Department suggested that we prioritise the hotspot areas so we will consider redeploying numbers from constituencies with no hotspot areas to areas that do.“This is to identify, isolate and control the Covid-19 pandemic in the state,” he said during a press conference at Komtar yesterday.Besides prioritising hotspot areas, they will also focus on testing people who are at risk, especially within hotspots areas.“There are eight categories for individuals at risk who will be eligible for testing.”One of the categories includes individuals at risk like senior citizens, pregnant women and children.The other categories are transport provider workers, essentials and services providers, hawkers and traders, those registered with MySejahtera, those living in hotspot areas, heads of families who live within target clusters and individuals registered as food or goods deliverers.“Besides the categories mentioned, individuals suggested to be tested in each state constituency will also be given priority.“At this stage, the testing method is being finalised and the State Secretary’s office is in the appointment process of deciding who to conduct the programme.“We hope to finalise everything by the end of this month and hopefully we can begin testing on July 1.“Then, depending on capacity and logistics, we hope to complete the entire programme in between 30 and 40 days.”Jagdeep said the testing programme is crucial as a preventive measure while the state continues vaccinations.“Right now, the state is taking steps to ensure more vaccination centres are set up as we aim to vaccinate 20,000 people a day.“We are always ready to expedite the vaccination process. But many have not registered for the vaccines yet.“In Penang, we need 80% of the population to be vaccinated, that is 1.34 million people out of the 1.8 million population.“For now, we have some 900,000 who registered so we hope another 400,000 people will come forth and register for vaccination,” he added.Meanwhile, on housing matters, Jagdeep said the state is committed to ensuring that the housing sector continues to move.“It is important to assist the housing chain as many people are involved when we approve projects.”He said up to yesterday, the state approved 283 applications involving 473 various works to be carried out under the state’s Housing Maintenance Maximum 80% Fund.“A total of RM45.2mil was spent here where most of the projects involved were lift and water tank upgrades and replacements.“Other works included upgrading or replacement works involving roofs, tar roads, walls, railings, piping and repainting works.”He added that up to June 16, the state spent a total of RM276mil on repair and maintenance projects involving public and private housing schemes in the state."
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,Metro,SHEILA SRI PRIYA,When stress hits disturbing levels,"STRESS and problems in coping with the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a 52% increase in people, mostly within the Klang Valley, calling the Befrienders Kuala Lumpur hotline for help.Majority of the callers comprise youths and teenagers.This was based on a study by a private university, which revealed that almost 75% of people aged below 40 were experiencing moderate stress levels.“This is not a good sign,” said Monash University Malaysia’s psychology department senior lecturer Dr Rachel Ting Sing Kiat.She said 258 people in Selangor took part in the “Covid-19 Psychological Stress Survey”, which was conducted between March and June last year.Dr Ting said the situation, however, had not improved this year as people were still affected by the pandemic.She revealed that senior citizens were better at coping during the pandemic, unlike the younger generation.“In the Klang Valley, teenagers and young adults are stressed because they cannot socialise like before.“We have secondary school students who are experiencing social phobias too, where they suffer from anxiety in returning to school,” she told StarMetro.She opined that students were not coping well with their studies due to the lack of student-teacher engagement.“Some tell me they are unsure if they are on the right track and if their teachers even received their homework through online lessons.“Online interaction is not the same as face-to-face, and because of this the younger ones feel stressed,” said Dr Ting, who is a licensed psychologist in the US.She said many young adults were suffering from relationship issues.“Loneliness has crept in among single parents and single people throughout the pandemic.“They cannot go dating or socialise, and many of them live alone in the city while their families are in their hometowns,” she pointed out.Meanwhile, people who have lost their jobs are facing financial stress, she said.“As for wealthy people, their investments have shrunk and this too adds to their stress levels,” she added.Dr Ting has created a non-profit support group on Facebook called Safe Space Covid-19 Malaysia, which has qualified volunteers who carry out activities for people in four categories, namely frontliners, Covid-19 patients, family of Covid-19 patients and people who have lost their loved ones to Covid-19.The group has over 100 members and 100 volunteers.“We verify the members’ identity and it is a closed group. The volunteers are those who have undergone psychological skills training,” said Dr Ting.She said the group organised live sessions online for them to chat, aside from online festival gatherings.“We do not conduct therapy on this page. Instead, we provide a support platform,” she elaborated.She encourages people who are suffering from stress to seek counselling from the various free services, if they lack the financial means.She said counselling was necessary as it provided additional support for people during the pandemic.“Everyone needs a non-judgmental listening ear,” she noted.Meanwhile, MCA publicity bureau chairman Chan Quin Er revealed that there were more queries on how to proceed with divorce since the movement control order began last year, based on her experience as a lawyer.She said the pandemic had also resulted in many elderly people stuck at home alone as they were cut off from family members due to the inter-state travel ban.She emphasised that mental health issues were complex, and what Wanita MCA’s Legal Advisory and Women’s Aid Centre (Lawa) did was provide an outlet for those who needed help.Persatuan Kebajikan Maha Malaysia, in collaboration with Lawa, conducts free email interactions, online meetings and phone calls offering counselling services during the MCO.The association sees a worrying trend with the increase in calls for help over the past one year.Association president Sung Yeow Swee said 83 reports comprised domestic violence cases.He said the worst hit in Klang Valley were those who had lost their jobs, especially the middle and low-income groups.“The number of callers comprising women have increased by four times compared to the same month last year.“This is why it is important to go for counselling.“People who seek counselling from us are dealing with family matters involving spousal relationships, or dealing with children and money issues.“Most of the problems were due to miscommunication among family members,” said Sung.On the positive side, he said people were becoming more open to the idea of counselling.For details on counselling and legal aid, call Lawa at 03-2716 5943.Befrienders Kuala Lumpur chairman Justin Victor said a worrying trend now was of people who were falling into depression.“We understand when people who have clinical depression call us, but now we are seeing many other people suffering from depression.“The lockdown has affected even those with no mental health issues before, due to their inability to do simple things such as visit their loved ones,” noted Victor.He revealed that women were also more likely to call for help over the phone compared to men who preferred not to talk about their problems, and that there were more women with failed suicide attempts compared to men.“Some 80% of those with suicidal thoughts who call us end up feeling much better about their situation after talking it out.“In most cases, they just need someone to talk to,” he said.He added that it was important for people to identify the signs and start learning about stress and depression through reliable channels, such as Malaysian Mental Health Association.To reach Befrienders KL, call 03-7627 2929 or visit www.befrienders.org.my"
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,Metro,,Chambers help ramp up healthcare capacity,"THE Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor (KLSCCCI) has donated medical equipment worth a total of RM502,000 to Sungai Buloh Hospital for treatment of Covid-19 patients.The contribution of two Centralised Monitoring System units and five intensive care unit beds was made in response to the surge in cases.Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (ACCCIM) president Tan Sri Ter Leong Yap said the rising death toll and overwhelmed healthcare system was of great concern to all.As part of the chambers’ ongoing efforts to curb the pandemic, the ACCCIM and its constituent members across the country are stepping forward to offer assistance in various ways.Last month, the ACCCIM donated 20 units of High Flow Nasal Cannula and three ventilators worth RM626,000 to Sungai Buloh Hospital and the Penang Health Department.This sum was jointly contributed by ACCCIM and a few of its leaders, namely Ter, Tan Sri Lee Oi Hian, Tan Sri Lim Kuang Sia and Dr Chia Song Kun.This is in addition to ACCCIM’s contribution towards the purchase of 33 ventilators for Sungai Buloh Hospital in the middle of May.Given the urgency of increasing vaccination coverage, the Terengganu Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry worked closely with Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin in mobilising resources for setting up an on-campus vaccination site, which is expected to administer 1,000 vaccine shots daily.Meanwhile, the Kelantan Chinese Chamber of Commerce plans to offer its hall space to be used as a vaccination centre.The ACCCIM has actively contributed towards helping to ramp up the country’s healthcare capacity through various Covid-19 funds since March last year.Besides that, a RM500,000 donation was made to the Malaysian Medical Association’s Sabah branch last October, an initiative in collaboration with the Sabah United Chinese Chambers of Commerce.While being part of the collective effort in fighting the pandemic, the ACCCIM hopes that the Federal Government will expedite the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme in anticipation of the large delivery of vaccine supply starting this month onwards.ACCCIM is of the view that the various phases of the movement control order have been critical in allowing the government and society to work together to keep the prevalence of infections at low and manageable levels.It also believes that mobilising and coordinating with businesses, industries and the private healthcare sector to source for more vaccines and fast-track the national vaccination programme is of the utmost importance."
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,Metro,LIEW JIA XIAN,Quiet fortnight and counting,"TWO weeks into the nationwide lockdown which began on June 1, Penangites appear to be staying home and adhering strictly to standard operating procedures (SOP) to flatten the Covid-19 curve.The latest checks by The Star found many main roads on Penang island were mostly free of traffic.There were noticeably more vacant parking lots in George Town, evidence that many were working from home.Only handfuls of shoppers were seen at supermarkets while several food delivery riders were spotted picking up their orders for customers staying at home.Karpal Singh Drive, which was usually packed with joggers, has gone quieter in the mornings.On June 2, the National Security Council updated the SOP and allowed only jogging and exercising alone in one’s own neighbourhood.The previous SOP allowed jogging and exercising alone within 10km from one’s home but authorities found people liked going to nearby scenic spots such as the Karpal Singh Drive promenade to run while enjoying the view of the sea.In other states, police fined joggers for driving to other locations for runs.Penang youth and sports committee chairman Soon Lip Chee said those who were issued compounds for SOP violation could appeal to the Health Ministry for a 50% reduction of the fine if payment was made within seven days.“The ministry will then decide on the appeal,” he said, adding that the public should exercise indoors for the time being.Meanwhile, there was the usual long line of cars waiting at the roadblock along Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway heading to Penang Bridge as cops checked every vehicle for the necessary documents before allowing motorists to travel between districts.Penang police chief Comm Datuk Sahabudin Abd Manan said the SOP compliance rate in the state had been 98% since the lockdown began.“A total of 668 compounds have been issued.“The common offences include not wearing face masks, not checking in with the MySejahtera app, gathering at crowded places and crossing states without permission.“I urge everyone to stay at home. Don’t go out unless it is absolutely necessary.“So far, we have carried out 107 spot checks in Penang.“We are determined to take action against individuals who disobey the SOP.“We have 650 personnel manning 46 roadblocks during the lockdown,” he said."

"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,Metro,ZAZALI MUSA,‘Revised high speed rail project will attract investors to northern Johor’,"JOHOR will benefit immensely if the government decides to revive the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High-Speed Rail (HSR) project in the future.Johor South SME adviser Teh Kee Sin said although Singapore would no longer be part of the project after it was terminated on Jan 1, the high-speed rail link project connecting Kuala Lumpur to Johor Baru could still go ahead.He welcomed the statement by MyHSR Corp chairman Tan Sri Esa Mohamed in his Letter to the Editor in The Star on May 19 that HSR plans were still on track.Esa in the letter said “The HSR, as a project of the utmost national importance for Malaysia, is very much on track.”He said the government had a clear vision of the project’s direction as well as how to achieve it, and that ongoing studies on the latest iteration’s financial and economic viability were extremely promising so far.“The project has long been studied and discussed for more than 10 years. We all know the returns and economic benefits are not for overnight gain,’’ Teh told StarMetro.He said the revised HSR project would encompass almost 90% of the original 350km of tracks, with stations in Sepang, Putrajaya, Seremban, Melaka and three stations in Johor, namely Muar, Batu Pahat and Iskandar Puteri.“The project, if revised and implemented, will attract investors to Muar and Batu Pahat, hence bringing development to both towns in northern Johor.”He said Singapore-based manufacturers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) planning to relocate their operations, might choose Muar or Batu Pahat.Teh said although Singapore was no longer in the HSR project, the Johor Baru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link, expected to be up and running by 2026, would improve connectivity and accessibility at the Johor Causeway.“Hopefully, the borders between Malaysia and Singapore will reopen quickly, once the Covid-19 infection curve is flattened, and cross-border activities return to normal as in pre-Covid-19 days,” he added.KGV International Property Consultants (M) Sdn Bhd director Samuel Tan said the viability of the domestic line (high-speed rail from Kuala Lumpur to Johor Baru) was in doubt due to perceived lack of passenger load.However, he acknowledged that there would be many downstream benefits from the project, with Johor standing to gain the most as it had three stations located along the track.“This will bring development to the Batu Pahat and Muar districts.“However, if the numbers cannot add up in terms of passenger load (due to lack of connection to Singapore), the project may end up as a white elephant and this must be avoided, more so under the current economic climate,” said Tan.He said, however, many were of the view that Singapore might link up with the domestic line to connect to the greater Trans-Asian Railway (TAR) network in the future.The TAR network, when initiated, would link Singapore through Malaysia to China via Indo-China countries.“Under such an arrangement, the HSR will take on a different profile. Its role as an economic multiplier cannot be underestimated,” said Tan."

When you feel like you are not up to doing anything, that is okay.“Do whatever you are comfortable with doing as that makes it easier for you,” added Dr Chua.For details on the therapy sessions subsidy, visit https://forms.gle/HXNaBp1mQs7TYLYq6For help in dealing with domestic violence or any kind of abuse, call Talian Kasih on 15999, Women’s Aid Organisation (WAO) on 03-3000 8858 or All Women’s Action Society (Awam) on 03-7877 4221."

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",1:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Covid-19 vaccines effective against the Delta variant,"The Delta variant of the coronavirus, first identified in India, is a cause for global concern with studies showing it is more contagious and resistant to vaccines than other forms of Covid-19.But there is also evidence that vaccines retain important effectiveness against the Delta variant after two doses.Here is what we know about how variants respond to jabs.Fewer antibodies ...Several lab tests show that the Delta variant seems to have stronger resistance to vaccines than other variants do.A British study published in The Lancet medical journal early this month (June 2021) looked at levels of neutralising antibodies produced in vaccinated people exposed to the Delta, Alpha (first identified in Britain) and Beta (first identified in South Africa) variants.It found that antibody levels in people with two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech shot were six times lower in the presence of the Delta variant than in the presence of the original Covid-19 strain on which the vaccine was based.The Alpha and Beta variants also provoked lower responses, with 2.6 times fewer antibodies for Alpha and 4.9 times fewer for Beta.A French study from the Pasteur Institute concluded that neutralising antibodies produced by vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab are three to six times less effective against the Delta variant than against the Alpha variant.... but vaccines still workAlthough they represent an essential marker, the levels of antibodies measured in a lab are not enough to determine the efficacy of a vaccine.In particular, they do not take into account a second immune response in the form of killer T cells, which attack already-infected cells and not the virus itself.As a result, real-world observations are crucial to measuring vaccine effectiveness – and the first results are reassuring.According to data published on June 14 (2021) by Public Health England, vaccination with Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca/Oxford is as effective at preventing hospitalisation in the case of the Delta variant as it is in the case of the Alpha variant.Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab prevent 96% of hospitalisations due to the Delta variant, while AstraZeneca/Oxford prevents 92%, according to a study involving 14,000 people.Previous data released by British health authorities at the end of May (2021) come to similar conclusions for less serious forms of the illness.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is 88% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 caused by the Delta variant two weeks after the second dose, while the jab is 93% effective for cases caused by the Alpha variant.AstraZeneca/Oxford shows efficacy of 60% against cases caused by the Delta variant and 66% in the case of Alpha.Scottish authorities published similar data on Monday (June 14, 2021) in The Lancet.The team behind the Sputnik V jab meanwhile tweeted on June 15 (2021) that theirs was ""more efficient against the Delta variant ... than any other vaccine that published results on this strain so far"".They did not publish results, but said the study by the Gamaleya Center, a Russian research institute, had been submitted for publication in an international peer-reviewed journal.One dose not enoughAmong the currently authorised vaccines (as of publication time), only the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is given in one dose instead of two, and not enough data exists to determine its effectiveness against the Delta variant.For the others, lab and real-world tests both conclude that one dose of any vaccine only gives limited protection against the Delta variant.""After a single dose of Pfizer/BioNTech, 79% of people had a quantifiable neutralising antibody response against the original strain, but this fell to ... 32% for B.1.617.2 (Delta),"" says the lab study from June (2021).The Pasteur Institute found that a single dose of AstraZeneca/Oxford would have ""little to no efficacy"" against the Delta variant.Data from the British government confirms the tendency in real-world scenarios: both vaccines were 33% effective against symptomatic cases caused by the Delta variant three weeks after the first dose, compared to around 50% effectiveness against the Alpha variant.In Great Britain, where the Delta variant is now responsible for 96% of new cases, these findings pushed the government on June 14 (2021) to reduce the waiting period between doses from 12 weeks to eight for people over 40.In France, the wait has been reduced to three weeks from five for a second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.The Pfizer/BioNTech jab does however offer very high (94%) protection against hospitalisation due to the Delta variant after one dose.Shots and physical distancingScientists agree that the best defence against the Delta variant is to get a full two-dose vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.Top French scientist Jean-François Delfraissy says creating a ""block of vaccinated people"" will help keep the Delta variant from spreading throughout the population.A US study from June 10 (2021) points to the importance of vaccination to keeping the list of viral variants from growing.""Increasing the proportion of the population immunised with current safe and effective authorised vaccines remains a key strategy to minimise the emergence of new variants and end the Covid-19 pandemic,"" it says.Antoine Flahault, who heads up the University of Geneva's Institute of Global Health in Switzerland, insists that it is still crucial to observe physical distancing, share infection information and observe restrictions when necessary to ""keep virus circulation low"".The more the virus circulates, he says, the more opportunity it has to mutate and generate new variations. – AFP RelaxnewsInformation in this post was accurate at the time of its posting.

You might as well be dead. Your career is over, just watch.""However, a report from Insider points out that these DMs may not have been real. For one, there is no verified checkmark next to Teigen's name. Instagram introduced verification in 2014, and Teigen was verified in early 2015, meaning these screenshots were purportedly taken in 2014.But the blue and purple message design was not implemented until 2020, and the video chat icon at the top of the screen was not introduced until June 2018, according to the report, which a representative for Teigen corroborated. A representative for Costello did not immediately respond to Variety's request for comment.On Friday, Teigen released a statement on Twitter, writing,""No idea what the f*** Michael Costello is doing. He just released a statement where he didn't at ALL acknowledge how fake the DMs were, & now claims to have emails that don't exist.""""Chrissy is completely surprised and disappointed by Michael Costello's recent attack, which includes fictional 'screenshots' from 2014 of supposed private messages that Chrissy did not send,"" the statement reads.""In October 2014, she did post a comment on Mr. Costello's Instagram when he was publicly accused of making a racist remark. After he denied the accusation, and claimed it was based on a photoshopped comment, Chrissy deleted the comment, as was reported at the time.""The statement went on to say that Teigen believed her relationship with Costello was ""cordial,"" referencing several online interactions they had over the years.""Chrissy has acknowledged her past behaviour and the pain she has caused, but she will not stand for anyone spreading false accusations to further demean her name and reputation,"" the statement continues. ""Chrissy will continue to do the work she needs to do to be the best person she can be. She hopes Michael Costello can do the same.""Legend also took to Twitter to defend Teigen, writing,""Chrissy apologised for her public tweets, but after her apology, Mr. Costello fabricated a DM exchange between them. This exchange was made up, completely fake, never happened.""Legend continued,""I encourage everyone who breathlessly spread this lie to keep that same energy when they correct the record.""On Friday, it was announced that Teigen would be ""stepping away"" from Safely, the cleaning brand she developed with Kris Jenner. An Instagram story posted to the brand's account reads: ""Chrissy will be stepping away from Safely to take much needed time to focus on herself and be with her family. We fully support her decision and are thankful for her contributions. The brand will continue to move forward and focus on our important mission of bringing high quality, hard-working cleaning products to all American households.""Earlier this week, Teigen penned a lengthy apology regarding previous tweets targeted at model and reality TV personality Courtney Stodden.""Not a day, not a single moment has passed where I haven't felt the crushing weight of regret for the things I've said in the past,"" she wrote in a Medium post on Monday. ""As you know, a bunch of my old awful (awful, awful) tweets resurfaced. I'm truly ashamed of them. As I look at them and understand the hurt they caused, I have to stop and wonder: How could I have done that?""The post continues,""I've apologized publicly to one person, but there are others – and more than just a few – who I need to say I'm sorry to.

E-mail them to lifestyle@thestar.com.my, with the subject ""Heart and Soul"". We’d love to hear from you. Keep your story within 900 words. We reserve the right to edit all submissions.It's been 19 months since I last flew back home to Malaysia.We sometimes take things for granted and often not realise how much the person beside us has done for us. And then one day, we find ourselves overwhelmed with memories of how much that person has influenced our lives.I lived with my parents for nearly 40 years till I got married and left for overseas three years ago. I didn’t give much thought about going far away because, as someone who is used to travelling, I believed that I could always visit them whenever I wanted to. In fact, in the first two years, I went back three times.Recently, while talking with my husband, I realised that I was speaking like Appa would. I started crying, overcome by emotion.The next day, on a call to Appa, I just burst out crying. I told him that he had taught me so much and that I was truly thankful for it. I apologised for the many times that I had hurt him. He went teary as well. We’ve had some clash of opinions and misunderstandings, mainly due to the generation gap of 45 years and how we viewed certain things a little differently. Nevertheless, the care was always there.Years ago, Appa and Amma drove me to a maktab in KL for my Diploma studies. Only upon reaching the college did we realise there were too many students staying in the student accommodation nearby. That was the first time I saw Appa in tears. So he and Amma spent one whole week staying in KL to look for a comfortable place for me to stay, and they found one.He always advised me to spend wisely and never take things for granted. I cultivated the habit of saving money since young. He always advised us to save for rainy days and that we shouldn’t resort to borrowing money from anyone. Once I started working, I started travelling, which he loved too. I still remember bringing back the US$300 he gave me for every trip I went on. I would refuse it every time but he’d insist that I keep it, in case of any emergency, but I’d travel within my budget. It was he who taught me to live within our means.Appa is also one who believes in not stressing out too much on anything. Years ago, it so happened that I had an SPM paper to sit for, the day after Deepavali. Seeing me cooped up in my room for hours engrossed in my revision, he came in and told me to put my books away and go watch a movie on TV. I still remember the movie Duet. He is a practical man. He wanted me to have a relaxed mind before the important day. He knew that when I set my mind to do something, I wouldn’t stop until I achieved it. He encouraged me to do what I love but also told me not to work too hard. Even now he tells me and my husband not to overwork and to have little breaks every now and then to avoid unnecessary stress.Since young, I had wanted to become an English language teacher like Appa, and he encouraged me to pursue it. He always told me to follow my passion and gave me the confidence I need to achieve it.Appa loves writing. Be it writing a letter or an opinion article for the newspaper, he did it with ease and flair. Naturally, I developed that passion, too. I may not be a great writer, but I learnt a lot from his style of writing. When we were younger, he’d often write certain grammar points on the whiteboard in our dining area and then call us, including Amma, and explain it to us. I then started writing. He was so proud of me whenever my articles got published.Another important life lesson that I learnt from him is to be kind and not disrespect people who are less fortunate. I often saw Appa talking in a friendly manner to the ones who did odd jobs in and around our home. He didn’t look down on them. In all the three schools I taught in, I had good rapport with the cleaners, gardeners and office boys and they were always nice to me.I also learnt not to get worked up when something beyond our control happens. He hardly blamed me or got angry over any wrong thing I did, let alone keep harping on it. In one incident, I was driving his car when a small lorry hit the passenger side of the car and the window was smashed. When I reached home and told him, the first thing he asked was if I was hurt. Only then did he step out to see the damage. I’m sure it broke his heart but he remained calm. He said it was an accident and even though I was careless in a way, he knew I that I’d be more careful next time.When we were younger, Appa brought home a dog whom we named Julie. Unfortunately, she passed away unexpectedly. As fate would have it, another dog came into our lives in 2000. We named her Julie too. I saw how Appa loved her. I had seen him feeding strays, even on his trips to India. And so, my love for dogs, especially the abandoned ones, kicked in. We rescued, fostered and rehomed many homeless dogs when I was in Malaysia, and all the dogs we’ve had are the ones we rescued.From him I learnt to be kind, not only to others but also to myself. Before leaving home three years ago, I told him not to worry about me as I’d always take care of myself and be happy, and this is because of all the confidence he had built in me over the years.I owe it to my Appa for how I view life and I’m so proud to be his daughter. Everything that I am today is because him and Amma, and I love them both beyond words."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,JULIA TAN LI YING,Heart and Soul: Happy Fathers Day to my 'Ninja Turtle' dad,"My dad, John Tan, is my role model, my friend, my tutor, and one of the two important mentors in my life (the other being my mother). He is my ultimate ""Ninja Turtle"" – my hero. I’ve always looked up to him for advice and guidance whenever I hit a road bump.He has rules set at home and practises proper manners even when guests are not around, setting a good example for us children. Manners such as not lifting up our bowl to drink soup but to use a spoon, tidying up our beds once we wake up, washing our cups and dishes, using proper words when we speak, and so on.He constantly reminds us that he isn’t a strict father and that he is also learning to be a better person. He is fair and disciplines us accordingly because he believes that we should be instilled with good values and taught how to behave from a young age so that we do not embarrass ourselves, and be successful in the future. We have to cultivate proper manners and discipline, because my Ninja Turtle says it will help us grow up to become good people.From the day we were able to read, he gave each of us a personal piggy bank and taught us to make a habit of saving our remaining pocket money in it. He always emphasises the importance of saving money for a rainy day because no one has a clue what will happen in the future.ADVERTISINGMy dad, who is one of 11 siblings, lost his father – my paternal grandfather – when he was seven years old. I’ve never heard any complaints from him about how hard it was at that stage of his life. He stayed strong and always lent his siblings a helping hand whenever they needed it. The protective big brother instinct is always in him. I am very similar to him in this sense because I am the oldest sibling in my family. Seeing how he handles family issues, how he is the glue to the family, relatives and friends, has made my respect for him grow.He is the first person I hope to speak to, rant to or gossip to about my day or anything that I am too embarrassed to share with my mother or friends. We are even friends on social media and we share funny moments on TikTok. Sometimes, he would crack some jokes or look at some funny memes on Instagram and we would laugh at them together. He encourages me to type using proper English words. He too learns alongside me and shares words he learnt with us to help build our vocabulary.“Do what is right, not what you want.” My dad’s favourite motto. He drilled this into my mind ever since I was mature enough to differentiate between what is wrong and what is right. I can say that this motto has saved me from trouble many times. I remember once when I wanted to copy my friend’s homework and ended up not doing it because it struck my conscience of going against what I had been taught.Turns out, my friend had plagiarised from one website and the teacher immediately caught her and later gave her an earful on the plagiarism and the serious consequences that follow.I enjoy his sharing sessions of wisdom and life experiences. It helps us think and ensures that we do not do things that we may regret. His advice has somehow always worked out for me, one way or another.I am 14, I am blessed to have him in my life to mould and teach me. I will improve myself so that one day he will look at me with pride, and can proudly show off how successful his daughter has become. Thank you, dad.I would like to wish him and all the fathers in the world, a Happy Fathers Day. Also, to my favourite uncle, Father Albert Tan, who has long been away in the Philippines for church work, and whose birthday is coming: Happy Fathers Day and Happy Birthday! Stay safe and healthy."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,K-pop group Brave Girls are ready for summer with new EP 'Summer Queen',"Brave Girls hosted a media showcase in southern Seoul Earlier this week to introduce its fifth EP Summer Queen.It has been 10 months since the release of the group‘s last EP We Ride, and during that time, the girl group has become a surprise sensation, climbing up to the top of music charts with songs from past albums.“This is the first time we’ve prepared with so much fun and excitement, ” said Minyoung.“When the music video started showing before, I teared up. I fought back the tears thinking that I should cry once we come in first place, ” confided Eunji. It has been quite challenging reaching this point, she acknowledged.“We were so desperate when we came out with Rollin', and we still are, but we also are very grateful, ” she added.The EP consists of five tracks including title track Chi Mat Ba Ram, that translates into the swish of a skirt, in both Korean and English.“We’ve come up with [the English version] hoping that the cool breeze from us would reach all over the world, ” explained Yujeong. – The Korea Herald/Asia News Network"
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",6:15 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,"In Japan, artists are raging against the Olympics","Miwako Sakauchi stands in her studio and brushes spinning swirls on torn cardboard and drawing paper, using the five colours designated as symbols of the modern Olympiad.Titled Vortex, her paintings show the ""anger, fear, sense of contradiction and state violence” over the residents evicted and the trees felled so enormous Olympic stadiums could be built, Sakauchi said. ""I can’t think of it as a ‘festival of peace’ in this situation. It's totally nonsensical.""The Japanese public mostly opposes holding the Tokyo Olympics next month during a pandemic, polls have shown, even though outward dissent such as protests has been small.One little-recognised outlet where people have expressed their frustration and fear over the Olympics has been art.T-shirts, drawings and other artwork have become a form of protest over the decision to hold the Games against medical advice and the public's opposition. Officials have responded in some cases by demanding the sometimes satiric art and merchandise be removed, and the artists say their freedoms are being curtailed.""What I can do instead of going to protests is to use my expertise in art, ” said Sakauchi of her motivation to produce the paintings. She has never participated in street protests or incorporated political issues into her abstract paintings in the past, but the Tokyo Olympics have been a tipping point.The risk of infection from the virus may have prevented people from taking to the streets to express their frustration.Sakauchi created the paintings after she was contacted by a group of artists who organised an anti-Olympics art exhibit last summer. Her works were displayed in another exhibition in February.Kai Koyama, the main organiser of the exhibition, said it is his professional duty to protest, even though he knows many Japanese are hesitant to openly show their opinions.""We’re artists. We wouldn’t exist if we didn't express ourselves, ” said Koyama, 45, in an interview. More than 20 artists have gathered for the project.Another artist who joined the anti-Olympic exhibition is Sachihiro Ochi, 52, a social worker and doctor in a clinic near Yokohama Stadium, which will host Olympic baseball and softball games. He says Tokyo and Yokohama, the nation's largest cities, have hardened their policies on the homeless because of the Olympics. Public spaces that were once open are now covered with coloured cones and obstacles, he said.Ochi has tried to illustrate that displacement, along with satirical motifs, in his paintings of the marathon and the national stadium.""There are people who lost their jobs and housing during the pandemic,"" said Ochi.Some creators of anti-Olympics art say their freedom of expression has been cramped even though their feelings align with growing public disapproval of the games.Before the pandemic, designer Susumu Kikutake made parody anti-Olympics T-shirts because of bribery and plagiarism scandals surrounding the Tokyo event. Online comments were harsh and he only sold around 10 shirts a month.But amid a recent virus surge and rising public concerns, the owner of the P&M shirt shop in Tokyo says demand has boomed. Sales reached 100 shirts in April and 250 in May.Kikutake said the spike reflects public resentment against a prolonged state of emergency issued by the government.""My kids’ sports events and school trips have been cancelled, and we have been forced to put up with it... but they say they can hold the Olympics, ” said Kikutake. ""It really irritates me that (the prime minister) does not explain why they are holding the Games, and he just keeps saying it will be ‘safe and secure’.”The Tokyo Games’ organising committee demanded Kikutake stop the production of the T-shirts over copyright concerns, he said. He started over with a new design that includes fewer Olympic rings and a misspelling of Tokyo as ""Okyo.”Similar attempts to satirise the Tokyo Olympics have been suppressed by the Tokyo 2020 organising committee, citing copyright infringement.The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan removed a parody drawing that uses the Tokyo Olympic logo combined with features of the coronavirus from their website after receiving a demand for withdrawal from the organising committee.Koyama, the art exhibit organiser, is planning a third anti-Olympics art event late next month, when the Olympic opening ceremony is slated to start.But galleries are wary of subversive exhibitions like his, the artist said. One that agreed to host the exhibit backtracked after far-right activists targeted the space with loudspeaker trucks demanding the cancellation of another exhibition they claimed was unpatriotic.""Freedom of speech is about to be extinguished because of the Tokyo Olympics, ” said Koyama. ”We’re being suffocated.” – AP"

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",3:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,GARY LIT YING LOONG,Heart and Soul: This kopitiam was Kampar's social centre in the 1960s,"“One teh, two kopi-O, three kaya toast!” Tall Sook shouted from the front to his workers in the kitchen at the back of his coffee shop.Although short and hunched, Tall Sook had a loud voice. Everybody called him “Ah Tall”, which means hunched back. Always good-natured, he didn’t seem to mind. In an ironic twist of courtesy, my mother insisted that we address him as Tall Sook or Uncle Tall.Tall Sook was the boss of the Nam Wah kopitiam in Kampar, Perak. Strategically located at a busy junction, it enjoyed brisk business in the 1960s. It boasted its signature Hainanese roti kaya, dai bao (big dumpling) and Loh Mai Kai (steamed glutinous rice with chicken). There was also a popular noodle stall there.Before the war, like many Hainanese folks, Tall Sook used to work for a British family at the army base in Penang.Through the years, he had perfected the art of preparing kaya toast, poached eggs and morning coffee. His bread was roasted over charcoal until it had a nice golden crispy feel. His homemade kaya was finger-licking good. It simply melted in our mouths. The aroma of his kaya and toast would drift upstairs where we used to stay. It made us drool.Every morning, as early as 5am, the hungry tin-mine workers would arrive for their breakfast. The tin industry was booming in the 60s, with thousands of workers. They would be eating either dai bao or a double portion of Loh Mai Kai. They would also have takeaways of some of Tall Sook’s famous kaya toast. They ate fast and worked hard.As a small-time tin-miner, my grandfather would also frequent Nam Wah for his daily fix of coffee and kaya toast. On his days off, he would take me and my brother there for breakfast. As the coffee was too strong for us, he would order some tea to mix with it. After that, he would pour some of the mixture on a saucer for us to lap it up. This was long before “yin-yang” tea became popular.Whenever we were at the coffee shop, my brother and I would collect some empty cigarette boxes left behind by customers. The common brands were Abdulla 37 and Lucky Strike. We would use them as “lego” blocks to build houses and other playthings. Despite smoking Lucky Strike for decades, my grandfather had still not made his big strike yet.Happy straysThere were about 20 marble tables in Nam Wah coffee shop. Typically, a family of six or seven would squeeze around a marble table. There would be a tam thuong (chamber pot) under each table for customers to throw their cigarette butts and other waste.The good life in Nam Wah attracted many stray cats and dogs. The rats were big and fat, too. The fat cats and dogs would prefer the easy life of feasting under the table rather than chasing rats or robbers.There would be either a dog or a cat lying under each table. The cats' mewing and the dogs' wagging tails tugged at the children's heartstrings. The children would be busy feeding the animals while their parents were feeding them. So, everyone was busily and happily feasting together. It was an eye-opening show of transfer benefits and associated leakages.One regular customer of Nam Wah was a jovial and short man. He was only about 4ft (1.2m) tall. Everybody called him lo sai (which means boss in Cantonese). As a bookie, he would come around the shop during lunch hour. His endearing toothless grin helped him to win many customers.He would approach his customers by greeting them, “Lo sai"", to flatter them and win some business. In response, some customers would tease him by saying that he was the real lo sai. Cantonese is indeed a flowery language with many intonations. Depending on how you say it, lo sai could also mean old and small. It was an accurate description of his age and stature.One of his regular customers was my father, who said that he was one of the most successful bookies working for a big “bookie king” who lived at the top of Golden Dragon hill, a residential area for the wealthy.The accident“Bang!” There was a sickening sound of crashing metal. It was a serious accident between a motorcycle and a car at Nam Wah intersection. From my room window, I could see the motorcyclist lying motionless on the road in a big pool of blood. The front part of the car was also damaged.The motorcyclist was surrounded by a big crowd of curious on-lookers. They were busy jotting down the registration numbers of both vehicles involved in the accident. They were hoping that the numbers would come out in the lottery draw. I was disappointed that they seemed to show more concern for their lottery prize than the welfare of the injured motorcyclist. A while later, an ambulance finally arrived to take the him away.Surprisingly, the car’s registration number actually came out during the weekend’s lottery draw. Hundreds of the townsfolk were jumping with joy and expecting to receive their windfall soon.However, in the middle of the night, the “bookie king” quietly and hurriedly slipped out of the country. He simply couldn’t afford to pay the prize money to everybody.It is rumoured that he went into hiding in London, where he remains until today. His big bungalow in Kampar lies empty till today, a sad reminder of the glorious 60s and a hollow life as a bookie king."

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",1:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Tips to safely reuse your N95 face mask,"Boiling, baking, airing out: The skills required to make sure you’re safe reusing an FFP2 face mask (equivalent to a KN95 or N95 mask) are more often seen in the kitchen.To be clear, anyone wondering whether these steps are really necessary before reusing a face mask, should know that pathogens you may have exhaled remain on the inside of your mask.Put the mask on again without doing anything, and you’re breathing them in.Also, your possibly infected hands touch the mask every time you take it on or off; from there, it can get in your eyes or nose.In short, it’s safer to kill bacteria and viruses before reuse.However, the question arises of how to maintain filter performance after disinfecting a face mask.Researchers in Germany have found three ways that are easy for the general public to disinfect their masks.The options are in the oven, in the air and in the cooking pot.The oven method has come under fire because it’s easy to mess up: If it’s too hot, the filter is damaged; too cold and viruses don’t die.Chemist Martin Kreyenschmidt opines that boiling your mask in a pot is the best method.Put the face mask in a tightly sealed bag meant for freezing or boiling, and put in the water for 10 minutes.“This is a very simple method where you can do little wrong.”An FFP2 mask can be boiled this way about three times at most.Before trying this method, be sure to read up on how to do it online first.The third method is air-drying: Hang the mask up with a hook and leave it to dry for a week.This can be done up to five times before the mask should no longer be used.Occupational safety expert Peter Paszkiewicz is sceptical of such reprocessing methods and belongs to those critical of the oven method.If you want to reuse a mask several times, he says, air-drying is best.“That’s what we recommend,” he says.Under no circumstances should the mask be stashed in a pocket or purse.“Then bacterial cultures develop quite superbly,” he says.Face masks should hang in the open – ideally, for several days in the sun.Indications such as “NR” or “R” on the masks are not relevant for everyday users, he says.NR means the masks should not be reused.But ”from an infectiological view, this has no relevance; it’s more related to occupational safety”, according to Paszkiewicz.Self-disinfecting masks are also available.Special materials in these masks deactivate viruses and bacteria within a certain amount of time, allowing you to reuse the mask safely afterwards.One solution uses positively-charged textile surfaces to destroy the negatively-charged bacteria and viruses.Researchers in Berlin have looked at these textiles and found that while the viruses will be deactivated, it takes a few hours.The SARS-CoV-2 virus particles are not neutralised straight away.From Kreyenschmidt’s point of view, such a product lulls consumers into a false sense of security, and it’s impossible to say realistically how quickly the protective ability will wear off.Before buying such a product, be sure to really study its certification and see what standards it meets – this will help prevent you from spending money on a face mask that’s, in the end, useless. – By Tom Nebe/dpa"

Her other half should not cling to her too much, she says, but it is also not ideal if he does not cling to her at all.Even if she gets into a new relationship, she said that she would not disclose this to the public, citing bad past experiences.""I don't think I received lots of blessings when I shared about (my relationships) in the past,"" said the actress who recently appeared in Chinese reality show Sisters Who Make Waves 2.""The more you share, the more they would find a way not to give their blessings.""Tang, 55, agreed, saying: ""They can complicate matters out of nothing.""Cheung added that she would keep mum even if it was discovered that she is dating.Cheung was married to Tse from 2006 to 2011, and they have two sons – Lucas, 13, and Quintus, 11.She has a third son, Marcus, two, and has never revealed the identity of his father.Besides the two actresses, Hong Kong veteran actor Paul Chun, 75, also appeared on the show.

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",11:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,How you can 'Save The Museum' from pests with a card game,"After being closed for months, museums are facing a new threat from pests. The scale of the problem is such that one curator has launched a new card game to help colleagues identify pests that can endanger art collections.Since last spring, insects and rodents have been taking up residence in museums around the world. Most pests are attracted to dark, quiet places, making the empty galleries of these cultural venues an ideal environment for such unwanted visitors.The Getty Museum in Los Angeles took advantage of its months of closure to carry out an intensive moth control programme. It reportedly took more than 6, 000 hours to clean the institution's 55 galleries from top to bottom, according to the Los Angeles Times.ADVERTISINGAnd it certainly isn't alone. Britain's National Trust reports that insect numbers increased by 11% overall in 2020 at its heritage properties, compared to the previous year. That's why Helena Jaeschke, a conservation development officer with the South West Museum Development Programme, has decided to tackle the problem in an original way. She recently created a card game called Save The Museum! with the help of her daughter, who works as a board game designer.A fun way to help fight pestsInspired by the card game Top Trumps, Save The Museum! consists of cards each featuring the silhouette of an insect to identify. The cards also contain additional information about the pests, such as their size, preferred environment and the damage they can cause in a museum.""You can flick through the cards to learn details about pests and possible treatments whilst having a coffee break, or else challenge each other with a game,"" Helena Jaeschke told The Art Newspaper.Save The Museum! card packs were distributed to the 140 museums and institutions participating in the South West Museum Development Programme's ""Pest Partners"" project. This initiative assists cultural venues with the recent increase in pest numbers, exacerbated by museum closures and staffing cuts caused by the pandemic.While Save The Museum! is primarily aimed at curators, Helena Jaeschke hopes that other employees will take an interest in the game to help museums get rid of these unwelcome visitors. - AFP"
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Not just pouring pints: Experienced staff missed as Irish pubs reopen,"It's been a long time since anyone in Ireland has been able to enjoy a pint in a pub, which were forced to stay closed as the pandemic upended public life around the entire globe.But as pubs are now allowed to reopen, it doesn't mean the challenges are over: Ireland's pub industry now must figure out how to replace the people skills of staff who left the trade during the pandemic.Kevin Barden, whose family owns the traditional Irish music pub O'Donoghue's, says he has been lucky to welcome back 19 of his 20-strong team after 15 months of closure, and he hopes the final one will also return in the coming months.But many other venues have not been so fortunate, according to Barden, and are finding it hard to fill their rotas.Until very recently, O'Donoghue's, a pub where the Irish folk band the Dubliners made their name, did not have a customer cross its threshold since March last year, when the Covid-19 emergency forced the closure of bars across Ireland.While relaxations allowed some pubs to reopen for periods in the months since, many traditional venues in Dublin remained closed throughout.Pints of stout are now settling on O'Donoghue's bar once again. However, ongoing restrictions mean the pub's defining characteristic – live music – will have to wait until Ireland takes some further steps back to normality in the months ahead.""We're nervous but excited,"" says Barden. ""It's been a long 15 months being closed. Coming into the pub and no one being here is just a weird experience.""He says getting ready to reopen had been ""a big joy"" and ""having the staff back – it's been great seeing them again"".Like so many workers across Ireland, the staff received an income through government Covid-19 wage subsidy support.""It's been tough for them and their families and they're chomping at the bit to get back,"" says Barden. ""We've 19 out of 20 coming back but I think we're definitely in the minority. Every pub in town seems to be looking for staff, whether it's floor staff or kitchen staff or bar staff.

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Swollen lymph nodes after Covid-19 vaccination could be mistaken for breast cancer,"Dear Mayo Clinic: A friend of mine shared that she went for her annual mammogram last week. At the appointment, she was asked whether she had been vaccinated for Covid-19 and had experienced any changes in her breasts. I recently received my first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Although I feel fine, I’m wondering if there is a connection between being vaccinated for Covid-19 and increased risk for breast issues? I am due for my mammogram appointment in a few weeks.In some women, breast cancer can present with lymph nodes that are swollen under one arm.Some patients have reported developing swollen lymph nodes after a Covid-19 vaccination.This has raised questions about whether screening mammograms should be rescheduled due to concerns that this finding could be mistaken for a potential breast cancer diagnosis.Mayo Clinic’s recommendation is that women should not delay preventive screening.Regardless of whether or not you have been vaccinated for Covid-19, you should come in for your mammogram as scheduled.However, you should let your mammography technologist know that you’ve been vaccinated for Covid-19, as well as how many doses you’ve received and which arm it was administered in.This information will be helpful in understanding the mammogram images.In your specific situation, you may want to consider having your mammogram before your next vaccine dose.If that is not possible, make sure you communicate with the technologist about your vaccination status.Lymph nodes are part of your body’s germ-fighting immune system.Your lymph nodes, also called lymph glands, play a vital role in your body’s ability to fight off infections.They function as filters, trapping viruses and bacteria before they spread to other parts of the body.This is why swollen lymph nodes are common in many people when they are ill.Common areas where you might notice swollen lymph nodes include your neck, under your chin, in your armpits and in your groin.When someone receives a vaccine, the lymph system is activated.Swollen lymph nodes are a common and harmless reaction to many vaccines, including for Covid-19.They typically occur under the arm where the shot was given.The swelling is a sign that your body is responding to the vaccine.Depending on the amount of swelling, some people may notice that their lymph nodes are larger and tender or painful to the touch.The challenge is that when your healthcare team sees swollen lymph nodes on a mammogram, they will want to evaluate it further.With the reports of swollen lymph nodes related to Covid-19 vaccination, your healthcare team will want to be particularly vigilant and ensure that the swollen lymph nodes are related to the vaccine and not breast cancer.It is also important to note that swollen lymph nodes are not seen in every woman who has been vaccinated for Covid-19.Most patients do not show changes in lymph node size on mammography.For those patients who feel swollen lymph nodes in their underarm, the current standard would be to perform a mammogram and ultrasound of the area.If enlarged lymph nodes are seen on your mammogram, but you are asymptomatic, an ultrasound will likely be recommended for further evaluation.You may be asked to return for a repeat scan in three months.Covid-19 has put everyone on alert, but my advice to women in general is that if you cannot have your mammogram prior to being vaccinated, keep your appointment and inform the technologist about your vaccination.Encourage your family and friends to stay up to date with their preventive screenings too.I also tell my patients that any skin changes – swelling of the breast, new lumps or bumps, or nipple discharge – should be checked out.And that goes for both women and men as breast cancer can affect both sexes.Early detection of breast cancer saves lives, so for that reason, regardless of what’s happening in the world, it’s important to not delay your breast cancer screening.Patients with cancer are at an increased risk for developing severe Covid-19 and being vaccinated is one tool to help prevent infection.We are seeing guidelines that say women at any stage of breast cancer treatment should be vaccinated for Covid-19 if they’re able.I encourage all cancer patients to be vaccinated for Covid-19 when it is available.But regardless of whether you are vaccinated or not, it is still important to practice safe behaviours, including wearing a face mask in public, practising physical distancing and performing proper hand hygiene. – By Dr Kristin Robinson/Mayo Clinic News Network/Tribune News ServiceDr Kristin Robinson is a radiologist with Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, United States.

It also says that publishers Macmillan in 1960 refused to publish her story The Mystery That Never Was, citing a ""faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia"".An academic who has written about Blyton, David Buckingham, emeritus professor of communication and media studies at Loughborough University, said: ""I think there are bits of Enid Blyton, like the story... where a doll gets its face bleached, that aren't what you'd want to be reading to a child.""""In a way you can say it was symptomatic of her time but it doesn't completely get her off the hook.""While Blyton enjoyed massive popularity with children, she was shunned by middle-class parents and the cultural establishment, he stressed.""When she was in her prime in the 1950s, she was effectively banned by the BBC for being of poor quality, and that continued right through the 1960s and 70s.""Enid Blyton died in 1968. - AFP"

"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",6:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,NASA MARIA ENTABAN,Datuk Dr Jacob Thomas is committed to keeping healthcare standards high in Malaysia,"Mounted against a wall in Datuk Dr Jacob Thomas’ office in Ara Damansara Medical Centre is a large display of awards and keepsakes he has collected from around the world.Each item tells a story. When asked which ones are the most memorable, the group medical advisor of Ramsay Sime Darby Health Care (RSDH) holds up a small pin which has “Vice President of the United States” engraved on it.“This was given to me by a member of the U.S. Secret Service from when former Vice President Al Gore visited Malaysia in 1998. We were near the helipad on the roof of Subang Jaya Medical Centre, which was the assigned hospital for his visit,” recalls Dr Jacob, who was at the time, the executive director of the hospital, and would later be appointed CEO.In the following years he would rise up the ranks, achieving many career milestones and receiving numerous accolades, his latest being his appointment as the Joint Commission International Board (JCI) chairman in January this year.The first Malaysian to hold this post, Dr Jacob has been a member of the board since 2014.Recognised as the gold standard in hospital accreditations, JCI is a division under The Joint Commission, said to be the world’s most trusted name in accreditation.JCI represents a worldwide consensus on quality patient care that reflects advanced healthcare practices and delivery trends that enable organisations to be high performers.From ensuring hospital machinery is working efficiently to performing checks on staff, JCI does a thorough survey of hospitals hoping to gain accreditation.“JCI is a body which checks all your credentials, ” explains Dr Jacob. “How do you make sure your patients are safe, how infection in the hospital is controlled, this was something which they started doing which got more and more popular.”“There are bodies who do this locally, for example Malaysian Society for Quality and Health which is a Malaysian accreditation body, among others.”“The role of JCI is to make sure patients are safe, that the hospital has good practices, when a patient complains, people attend to it, and make sure that your doctors are screened, that they are competent.”Surveys are conducted by three surveyors, who spend five days in the hospital, examining everything in every single department, from whether your X-ray machines are calibrated to whether your fire extinguishers are working.“They check on how safe your hospital is, they look at your sprinklers and in between rooms if there is a partition in the ceiling, a smoke barrier. Before I was on the board, I’ve seen the surveyors, a team made up of a doctor, a nurse and an engineer, carrying out their work. They’ll prop a ladder up and climb up to the ceiling and look to see what is happening inside, ” explains Dr Jacob.Being appointed chairman is an honour, says Dr Jacob.“To be part of this, not just for me, but for the country and the hospital. It’s a big honour, not everybody gets to be chosen for this.”“Many, many things so genuinely gave me satisfaction than when I get into something which brings attention to our region and to the country.”A lifetime in healthcareKeeping healthcare standards high is a passion of Dr Jacob’s, who has served in the armed forces, public and private healthcare for more than 40 years.Today, apart from his role in RSDH, he works closely with various NGOs and government agencies to promote Malaysian Healthcare both locally and internationally, and he is also a steering committee member of the National Key Economic Areas (NKEA) for Healthcare.Dr Jacob’s dream was to become an ENT specialist, and he was on track to pursue this ambition when life took an unexpected turn.“I always wanted to be a surgeon. I have two elder brothers, the eldest is an eye specialist, and my late second brother was an orthopaedic surgeon, he was the head of orthopaedics for the whole of Malaysia, who passed away just after he retired.”He was given a scholarship to work under a famous ENT surgeon in the United Kingdom and was all prepared to embark on this journey when a robbery in his home left him with severe injuries to his hand.“When my son was eight months old, five robbers broke in and as I tried to stop one from stabbing me, I caught hold of his knife, ” recalls Dr Jacob. “He pulled the knife away and left three of my fingers dangling.”Hand surgery restored movement in one finger, but to this day two remain stiff.“That’s how I had to give up my desire to become an ENT specialist, but when I look back now, I realise it’s God’s way of saying that that path was not for me, so I went this administrative route and I have no regrets.”Dr Jacob is passionate about helping others in any way he can, whether it’s by recommending doctors to friends and family or by lending a listening ear to troubled souls.“One thing that gives me satisfaction and joy is helping people. The staff are friendly with me and I greet everyone, whether you’re in housekeeping or a top surgeon, ” says Dr Jacob, who recounts an incident where he found a telephone operator crying because her husband had left her.“She had two small children and didn’t know what to do and had nobody to talk to, and I sat with her and we talked. When I saw her years later, she said she became strong after that and her two children had graduated, I was so happy to hear that, ” recalls Dr Jacob.“I’m a people person. Whatever I’ve done, whatever I’ve achieved, in the end if I can help somebody else or give advice, that gives me the most joy.”He attributes this quality to his parents, who never hesitated to help others in need, even though they themselves were not well-off.His father, an engineer, would always find time to talk to the labourers and gardeners who lived in the same neighbourhood, and would advise them on how to save money.“We came from a poor family, as a young boy I only had one pair of shoes and if they got soaked in the rain I would have to wash them and put them on the stove to dry. We didn’t have a phone in the house and I used to watch TV in the neighbours’ house, but I’m grateful to my parents for the example they were, and for giving us an education.”These are the values Dr Jacob and his wife, Datin Dr Indira Verghese, an eye specialist, have instilled in their two children.“This has rubbed off from us without even teaching them. They’ve watched us, how we treat those who need help, which is something I learned from my parents.”“For our children, we gave them an education, made sure they can stand on their own two feet, what more can you do?”The wall of memories in his office is something of a testament to the much-loved and respected figure many know him as.“My wife has seen all this and she told me, when you retire, please don’t bring any of this back home, ” he jokes.For one so committed to his work, it’s hard to imagine Dr Jacob retiring.On whether he plans to stop working in the near future, Dr Jacob quips “I’m scared to retire. The moment I retire, I’ll start rotting, ” he adds with a laugh."
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",5:25 PM MYT,Lifestyle,DINESH KUMAR MAGANATHAN,Outdoor dad to hipster pops: there’s a book for every sort of father out there,"This Sunday, we celebrate our fathers and all the men in our lives who are dear and important.Though the pandemic has made this Father’s Day a subdued affair, make no mistake it is still a special family occasion.Books are great as a gift in our opinion, and we've picked out a list of recently released Malaysian reads for your consideration.From the outdoor dad and the old school storyteller type right to the design-savvy dad and history buff, there’s a book for every sort of father out there.FOR THE HISTORY BUFFDiary Of A French Missionary is a perfect book for WWII history enthusiasts who want to venture beyond regular combat stories in Malaya under the Japanese rule. This book is based on a handwritten diary, which was meticulously kept by French priest Father Marcel Rouhan, the director of the College General in Penang, during WWII.While most Allied citizens were evacuated before the Japanese forces invaded, the French missionaries remained behind as ""neutral"" subjects. Rouhan's diary, therefore, is an exceptional eyewitness account of survival during the Japanese occupation in Malaya.The diary has been translated, introduced, and annotated by Serge Jardin, a French author long domiciled in Malaysia.FOR THE MUSIC-LOVING POPSWe couldn't locate a recent book on local music that was noteworthy. Instead, we decided to go with a highly-inventive Malaysian rock album - released on vinyl - which is bound to delight record collector dads.Not all dads are into oldies. For a change, why not get him MonoloQue’s latest album Lagu Perang (Bunyi Gamelan Melayu di Abad ke 21)?A recent MonoloQue Instagram post described this album as ""an amelioration of traditional culture, language, and legacy."" That might be accurate. This album is ambitious in forging a new narrative for the gamelan's use in a contemporary setting. The Orkes Gamelan Pahang Di Raja (and the ancient instruments) is as important to this recording as the pop star guests (Najwa to Aizat Amdan), but it is main man Loque who must be applauded for putting everything together.This double LP, which was 10 years in the making, comes in the form of a deluxe vinyl box set, making it a cool gift for adventurous ears.FOR THE OUTDOOR DADHitting the jungle trek and being near wildlife is definitely a no-no this lockdown season. But the late Stella Rajendran’s coffee-table book on Malaysian birds will definitely transport you to the wild outdoors.Stella, a beloved Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) member, photographer and artist, had beautifully captured the beauty of her winged subjects, basking among natural foliage in Malaysian Birds, A Glimpse.The book, published by MNS and edited by Allen Jeyarajasingam, features 197 selected bird species with 300 colour photographs, caught expertly by Stella's artistic eye. But this is not just a photography book.Scan the QR codes and find out more about the featured birds in the MyBIS (Malaysian Biodiversity Information System) bird database.Proceeds from the sale of this book will be channlled to Stella Rajendran Environmental Education Fund, which will help MNS to organise environmental education programmes for school children.FOR THE STORYTELLER DADLame jokes and age-old stories seem to be many fathers’ favourite pastime. Why not show your dad how it’s properly done with Tan Sri Vadaketh Chacko George’s Some Stories I Have Told And Some That I Haven’t .This 274-page book - which goes back to the dawn of Malaysia - contains 100 funny, witty and insightful stories the retired Court of Appeal judge and former lawyer has told all through his colourful (public) life.Famous figures on board include former Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra, and the late Sultan of Perak Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah, who George befriended during their law student days in London in the 1950s.In all, these warm-hearted stories from George about friendship, family, life and work reminds readers that a good story should always be shared.FOR THE POP ART DADIf your dad is hip and slightly subversive, he might enjoy Banned in KL, Astro Boy Rides The Wave To Sky Kingdom On A Grasshopper: Malaysia In Fifteen Postcards.Here is something that is part history, part art project and full of curious fun. The visual impact is also most striking. From ice cream wrappers in the 1980s and 1990s underground gig poster to the Syair Ghayat Al-Muna in the 1900s and Raja Bomoh seen through art, readers can enjoy a different take on local history and national propaganda.Through the pages, Universiti Malaya Professor Dr Simon Soon, architectural researcher Lim Sheau Yun, and digital researcher Ong Kar Jin take readers on a unique throwback journey.Each historical image is printed on perforated pages that can be freed and used as postcards.FOR THE PHOTOGRAPHER DADGrabbing his trusted camera and roaming the streets for a photography walk may not be possible in this extended lockdown. So, why not get your father the next best thing?Penang At A Glance is a wonderful photobook commissioned by the George Town Festival to preserve the island state’s unique diversity.The photobook showcases both the familiar and the never-before-seen images of Penang captured by Govindarajoo Selvathurai, Oh Chin Eng, Sherwynd Rylan Kessler and Thum Chia Chieh.These photographers have beautifully recorded Penang’s fantastic landscapes, time-honoured traditions, vibrant festivals, homegrown arts and of course, the friendly people.FOR THE (LOCAL) HANTU-LOVING DADThe late Singaporean politician Othman Wok was a man of many talents. Did you know he was one of the pioneers of Bahasa Malaysia ghost stories and horror fiction in Singapore and Malaysia?As a young reporter for Utusan Melayu and Mustika magazine between 1952 and 1956, Othman made a name for himself as a ""cerita hantu"" specialist.His classic works are much coveted by book collectors now.The recently released A Mosque In The Jungle is good news for Othman's cult following. It assembles two dozen of the best stories from his three fiction collections in English: Malayan Horror (1991), The Disused Well (1995) and Unseen Occupants (2006). Curated by Singaporean award-winning poet/writer Ng Yi-Sheng, this book provides an entry point into Othman’s world of horror.Here’s the perfect treat for family late night tales.FOR THE INTERIOR DESIGNER DADIf you’re not a big fan of your dad’s interior designing skills demonstrated in this lockdown season, maybe Malaysia-based architect/writer Robert Powell’s Terrace Transformations In The Tropics is the Father’s Day gift you’re looking for.Complete with sectional drawings and stunning pictures by professional photographer Lin Ho, this book suggests innovative and cleverly inspired solutions to spruce up your Malaysian terrace house.From introducing nature into mid-terrace houses to bringing sunlight into the interior and naturally ventilating your home, your dad would be spoilt for choice with the 26 terrace houses shown in the book."
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",,Food,CHRIS CHAN,Curious Cook: Strokes and diets,"My dog suffered a strange, worrying episode 2 weeks ago. His eyes started twitching wildly and his head drooped heavily to his left. It was also clear he was not quite conscious anymore and we drove him to the vet immediately.The diagnosis was a haemorrhagic stroke in his brain and there is not much that can be done apart from putting him on some medication. But at least, we seemed to have caught it in time and we have some treatment options for him, though he is not quite the same as his head is now permanently turned to his left, which oddly makes him look even more cute.As he is my top assistant when working and writing, the subject of strokes was worth investigating, as it was extremely disturbing to see one in action. My mother also suffered three strokes, two of which were very severe and the last one ended up finally causing her death.Types of strokesNot all strokes are the same, even though all strokes are effectively an attack event in the brain. There are three kinds of strokes:1) an ischaemic stroke is caused by some blockage (e.g. a blood clot) cutting off the blood supply to parts of the brain. This is the most common type of stroke.2) a haemorrhagic stroke is caused by a bleeding in or around the brain (e.g. when a blood vessel in the brain bursts or fails); and3) a transient ischaemic attack (TIA), also known as a mini-stroke. It is the same as a stroke, except that the symptoms last only for a short period of time because the blockage stopping blood getting to the brain is only temporary.Incidences of strokesEvery year around 800, 000 Americans suffer a stroke, and roughly 610, 000 of them are first-time occurrences. Also, approximately 160, 000 Americans die from stroke-related issues every year, which is roughly one in 20 deaths in the country.The risk of strokes for men in the USA roughly doubles every decade of age from age 55 or so, where the 10-year probability is 5.9%, increasing to 11% at age 65 to over 22% at age 80 or more. For women in the USA, the 10-year probability is 3% at age 55, rising to 7.2% at age 65 and then 23.9% at age 80 or more.The incidence of strokes in the USA is not typical of every country, but it does roughly match the statistics from many Westernised countries.Risk factorsThere are some unavoidable risk factors, such as age, gender, race, and a history of strokes in the family due to genetic factors. There may not be much one can do about such factors, but they may not be necessarily as dangerous as the avoidable lifestyle and dietary risk factors.And most of these avoidable risk factors are related to the diet, apart from smoking and physical inactivity. So, in no particular order of importance, the dietary-related risk factors are normally:• hypertension (high blood pressure)• heart disease• diabetes• cholesterol imbalance• obesityThe simple (and surprisingly often very difficult) solution for managing the above risk factors is to maintain a proper diet. That is because the dietary risk factors are related, in varying degrees.A diet which helps reduce obesity also reduces heart disease, hypertension, cholesterol imbalances and may also ameliorate diabetes. Similarly, a diet to cope with heart disease will also help with the other risk factors. Looking at it another way, changing dietary habits to tackle any risk factor which may be of concern has the free benefit of reducing the risk in the other factors.The optimal dietI think by now most people would be aware that a better diet for health in general is one that incorporates five (80-90 grams) portions of fruits and vegetables daily with sensible proportions of good fats, proteins, fibre-rich foods, and meal quantities. And by now, most people would also have encountered probably hundreds of dietary suggestions, a certain proportion of which would have arisen from sponsored campaigns by food marketeers.Therefore, I do not intend to offer advice, but instead review an interesting large-scale study into heart disease which curiously turned out to be one of the more intriguing studies into strokes.A curious studyThe 2013 ‘Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea’ (PREDIMED) study in Spain was the largest randomised controlled experiment examining the effects of a Mediterranean style diet ever conducted.All 7, 447 participants in the study were aged between 55 to 80 years and selected because they were at high risk of cardiovascular disease (due to smoking, being overweight, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia (cholesterol imbalance), or a family history of heart disease).The experiment was simple. One third of the participants were to have a Mediterranean diet supplemented with a litre of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) every week, one third were on a Mediterranean diet augmented with a mix of nuts (15 grams walnuts, 7.5 grams almonds and 7.5 grams hazelnuts), and the final third control group was put on a low-fat control diet.The study was stopped early because the results were too good.After only 4.8 years, both the EVOO group (30%) and the nuts group (28%) had an average of 29% lower risk of heart disease than the control group. The explanation for this effect was investigated in some depth and the best theory was that it was due to compounds called polyphenols in EVOO and nuts. It appears that polyphenols might protect the cardiovascular system by improving the endothelial function and enhancing the endothelial synthesis of nitric oxide produced by digestion of EVOO and nuts.Endothelial is the medical term related to the endothelium (the thin layer of cells that line the blood vessels, heart, and some body cavities), and nitric oxide promotes vascular dilation and protect blood vessels from damage due to platelets and cells circulating in blood.A meta-analysis against other studies (covering 101, 460 people and 38, 673 stroke survivors) to validate the PREDIMED findings also found a strong correlation, and this meta-analysis additionally found that consumption of EVOO reduced the risk of strokes by 27%, which was a bonus result.This close link between heart disease and strokes should not be unexpected; in short, what is good for cardiovascular conditions appears to be just as good for strokes, as mentioned earlier.Other more in-depth analysis of the PREDIMED data found that people who consistently ate red and processed meats and other forms of typical junk foods were 48% more likely to have a cardiovascular event and 47% more likely to die. But remember, the people in the study all already had existing heart conditions, and many are past middle age. From this, the implication is people should avoid junk food and certain meats if they currently have a heart condition.Although it is commonly perceived that fats are involved in strokes, there are curious anomalies in the stroke death rates in the world’s top fats consuming countries. For example, Belgium (95.0 grams), Germany (85.54 grams) and Malaysia (78.3 grams) are amongst the world’s top countries in daily fat consumption, but the rates of strokes are significantly different. Belgium has a stroke death rate of 7.94%, Germany 7.58% and yet Malaysia is 9.8%, over 2.3% higher than Belgium despite consuming almost 18% less fats.To be fair, some of the difference in Malaysia is probably due to poorer health care systems, but there is also persistent evidence that the types of fats make a significant difference. Trans-fats are now banned for home consumption in much of the Western world but are often still sold in many tropical countries due to their ability to tolerate higher storage temperatures. Also, countries consuming mainly olive oil such as France and Spain have significantly lower stroke deaths despite having roughly the same fat intake as Malaysia.Lifetime riskAn often-quoted paper called the Framingham Study in 2005 calculated the likely incidence of a stroke occurring within the lifespan of a US citizen. It turns out to be more than 1 chance in 6 for a middle-aged person, around the same for Alzheimer’s Disease. Interestingly, the study also estimated hypertension is the most significant factor determining the lifetime risk of getting a stroke. People with normal blood pressure had roughly half the risk of developing a stroke compared to people with high blood pressure (ie, >= 140/90 mm Hg).My dogAs I started writing this, my dog appeared to have suffered a TIA (mini-stroke) this evening. He is resting now but it was a sobering reminder about the tissue-thin fragility of health. Less than three weeks ago, he was bounding around in the woods. Now we are watching him anxiously as he sleeps fitfully.I do not know what the stroke risk factors are for dogs, but at least you should now have a better idea of what they are for people.The views expressed here are entirely the writer’s own."
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",,Food,CHRIS CHAN,Curious Cook: The legs in your glass of wine,"In 2020, the global wine industry suffered a double whammy. Production was up, but consumption was down and as a result, the average price of wines had fallen worldwide.It would be easy to blame the pandemic for these statistics, but 2020 was the third year in a row where wine consumption fell, and it fell by 2.8% globally. The closing down of hospitality venues such as bars and restaurants due to the pandemic obviously had an impact, as did the USA tariffs on EU wines. Importantly, the 17.4% fall in wine imports by China also accounted for a sizable chunk of the 2020 fall in global consumption as China is the world’s sixth largest wine importer.Sparkling, festive wines such as champagne were the hardest hit in 2020, down disproportionately 15% by volume as fewer people found reasons to celebrate during a pandemic.Against all that negative news, one curious spot was that French wine consumption was up 14% in 2020, possibly encouraged by the lockdowns where there were seemingly fewer things to enjoy except another bottle of wine. The quality of wines consumed was also higher as the French appeared to be paying more for their wine drinking at home.This may be because quality wines were selling for less; a normal bottle of Margaux would normally retail for over 25 Euro (RM126) but I was buying them for 15 Euro (RM75) during the wine festivals. As a result, my cellar is now reasonably well-stocked to cater for a large wedding party if that ever became a necessity.Legs or tears?One thing quite intriguing and enjoyable is watching the interaction of wine with a normal wine glass. A swirl of any wine with more than around 11% alcohol content in a wine glass invariably leads to a fascinating inverted crown of liquid in the glass which has “legs” or “tears” flowing back down into the wine at the bottom of the glass.By the way, it is important to note that this works only with wine glasses that have not been cleaned in a dishwasher using a rinse solution as many rinses add a thin layer of polymers inside the glass.Initially, one would assume this phenomenon is simply due to the wine settling back down after a swirl, but prolonged observations have confirmed that this is not the case. One reason is that the amount of liquid dripping back down the sides of the glass often continues unabated even after many minutes, hence it cannot be a gravity effect as more liquid falls back down into the wine than was displaced by the swirling of the glass. So, the question is: how does wine replenish itself up the sides of a vertical wine glass?This phenomenon is known as the Marangoni Effect, discovered by James Thomson in 1855 and explained by Carlo Marangoni about 10 years later. And if you enjoy a good drop of alcohol, the reason for this gravity-defying effect might endear you even more to wines and spirits.Typically, the Marangoni Effect leads to features such as the display of legs or tears in a mixture of liquids, or the movement of liquids in a closed system. These liquids first need to have some contrasting characteristics. In wines, the liquids involved are the combination of ethanol (the alcohol present in wines and spirits) and water. Ethanol has two important differences to water: (i) it has a lower surface tension than water, and (ii) it evaporates faster than water.The difference between the surface tension of ethanol and water creates something called a surface tension gradient. Surface tension is both a tensile and a contractile force on the surface of liquids – the higher the surface tension tensile force (i.e. the ability of a liquid to form a film), the stronger also is the contractile force of the liquid (i.e. the ability of the liquid film to pull away from an area of low surface tension).The simplest way to view the Marangoni Effect is via a dish of water where some finely-ground white pepper or nutmeg powder has been sprinkled on top. Touch the middle of the dish with a drop of washing-up liquid and the powder will shrink immediately to the edges of the dish. This is because the area around the washing-up liquid has a lowered surface tension; hence this drives the area of lowered surface tension to the area of higher surface tension due to the higher contractile force.Note that this effect will be observed only if the amount of washing-up liquid used is not too high or diluted inside the water in the dish. Otherwise, there will be no Marangoni Effect visible as then the surface tension would be diminished to some common reduced point. This is a relevant point to remember in the following explanation.Surface tension gradientThe surface tension gradient is the difference between the surface tensions of two liquids in the same mixture. In a wine bottle, this difference is not always apparent as the ethanol and water content is initially well mixed together, but the inherent surface tension gradient of wine is easily exposed by swirling it in a wine glass.So, finally, this is how wine develops legs or tears.Swirling the wine in a wine glass exposes the wine to two important factors: evaporation and a surface tension gradient. The evaporation of ethanol is enhanced by the swirling as it exposes a greater surface area to air. The means the concentration of alcohol is reduced in the film of wine exposed by the swirling of the glass.This increases the surface tension gradient significantly as there is now more water content in the film around the glass, instead of the original roughly balanced mixture of ethanol and water. That is because water evaporates slower than ethanol.The net effect of ethanol evaporation is to pull more wine up the sides of the wine glass as the initial tangential stress (or increased contractile force) caused by the reduction in alcohol is higher than the force of gravity. Initially, the surface tension gradient is relatively low as the ethanol is mixed in well with the water content.But when ethanol is evaporated faster than water, the surface tension gradient spikes up to the point it can surpass even the force of gravity. Hence more wine is pulled up from the bottom of the glass onto the sides.The volume of wine dragged up the glass accumulate and form bigger and bigger droplets. After a certain point in time, the weight and volume of these droplets are unable to resist gravity and hence they start to flow back down the glass. These are the legs or tears one can observe in wine glasses.So now one can understand why one cannot see legs or tears in a closed bottle of wine or spirits. There is not enough evaporation to reduce the ethanol content enough to develop the required tangential stress (or contractile force) to pull the bottle contents up the sides.Therefore, from the above, it should be obviously not true that larger legs or tears always mean there is more alcoholic content in a wine. That is because an important factor is evaporation. This means the impact of the Marangoni Effect in wines is heavily influenced by factors such as humidity and heat.However, where wines are compared in the same environment, then the alcohol content would be strongly correlated with the size of legs or tears observed. In such a case, a higher ethanol content will result in larger legs or tears.So, I hope one now can appreciate not only the taste but also the complexity and beauty of the physics and chemistry in a glass of wine.This is dedicated to Allan Cheah, a wine lover in KL who passed away from Covid-19 on 20 May 2021.The views expressed here are entirely the writer’s own."

"Tuesday, 15 Jun 2021",,Food,ABIRAMI DURAI,Adventures in grocery shopping during the lockdown,"One of the seemingly routine things in life that the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdowns have totally transformed is grocery shopping.Buying food essentials was once a matter of popping into the nearest supermarket, wet market or sundry shop and getting whatever you needed. There were no time limits – self-imposed or otherwise – and everything could be purchased at leisure. You could even shop for fresh produce every day if you liked. But those halcyon days of unlimited grocery shopping freedom are temporarily on hold, as Malaysians come to grips with the reality of the pandemic.These days, in line with the current lockdown and high Covid-19 figures, locals have been advised to either buy their food essentials online or plan their grocery shopping trips well and stock up on food to last for a longer period of time, rather than risk unnecessary trips to the supermarket.Many people seem to have taken this advice to heart. Team manager Ezrin Nik Ismail for instance, only goes to the supermarket once a week now and buys all her seafood online.“I still prefer going to the supermarket, because for me, when I go to the store, I will be like ‘OMG, I need this!’ Sometimes on online platforms, I cannot think of what I need. So I go to the supermarket once a week early in the morning when it’s very quiet and buy a lot of things for the week, ” she says.While Ezrin now totally avoids wet markets, given the fears associated with the Covid-19 clusters that emerged from some markets last year, others still find that produce is freshest in wet markets.“I go to the wet market once a week around 6am because I can get very fresh meat and seafood and it’s not crowded, ” says stay-at-home mum Theresa Choo.Choo also buys other food essentials from her neighbourhood supermarket but is careful not to shop for too long.“If I go to the supermarket, I will go at times when I think the crowds won’t be there and even then, I do a very quick grocery run. It’s not like in the past when you can linger and wander along the aisles, now I have a list and just grab ingredients and dash home within 30 minutes!” says Choo.Stay-at-home-mum Valerie Michael meanwhile only goes to the supermarket every two weeks or so and plans all her meals based on what she has purchased.“I only have one freezer so I cannot stock up much, but I plan my meals after going to the supermarket. So I don’t cook a lot of food at every meal, I try and stretch all the ingredients. If I do cook more, I freeze the extra meals, so that if I run out of food, I have back-up meals in the freezer.“For emergencies, I also have a sundry shop in my condo where I can buy a small selection of veggies and other items, so I sometimes shop there to limit unnecessary visits to the supermarket, ” she says.Valerie combines this with online grocery sites, which she uses to buy milk for her children as well as spices and cooking sauces.Tuition teacher Amrawati Narayanan meanwhile typically stocks up on two weeks’ worth of groceries every time she goes to the supermarket. And even going to the supermarket is a carefully calculated affair these days.“I really try to avoid going out and doing physical shopping. Sometimes even when I need to go the supermarket, I drive past first to see if it is crowded. If I see that there are a lot of people inside, I won’t go in, ” she says.To combat running out of ingredients, Amrawati has come up with a unique barter system with a vegetable seller who happens to be the mother of one of her tuition students.“She sends fresh veggies to my home and I just counter the amount I owe her with the tuition payment, ” she says.On top of that, Amrawati and her immediate neighbour have developed a routine where they buy fresh food and other ingredients for each other when they do their individual supermarket runs.“I ask my neighbour if they anything and they do the same, so we buy food for each other. And what’s nice is we don’t even take money for these purchases, ” says Amrawati.Property developer Raymond Ng meanwhile has opted to limit his supermarket excursions as much as possible in a bid to preserve the health and safety of the occupants of his house, namely his octogenarian grandparents and two young kids.“I normally order chicken, pork and fish online once a week. When that is delivered, I sanitise everything first before storing it away. For vegetables, I buy a little extra as I have a few fridges. Then I plan what to cook for the week, working through leafy vegetables like spinach first before using up hardier vegetables like cabbage, ” he says.Ng is very adamant about curtailing trips to the supermarket during this period as he wants to set an example for everyone else in his family.“I don’t go out very often for grocery runs because I am responsible for the health and welfare of two elderly people and two young children. I take that responsibility very seriously.“Also I feel that I can’t tell everyone to stay at home if I am constantly going to the supermarket or wet market. I have to look after my family and this means staying at home as much as humanly possible, ” he says."
"Tuesday, 15 Jun 2021",,Food,ABIRAMI DURAI,"An increasing number of home cooks are turning to healthy, immunity-boosting food during the lockdown","When the first edition of the movement control order (MCO) kicked off in March last year, millions of Malaysians were housebound for weeks on end with little external stimulation. Which is why – unsurprisingly – people turned to cooking and baking with a vengeance.Very quickly, home kitchens transformed into culinary havens, from whence all sorts of adventurous, innovative meals emerged. There were no limits to what the imagination could produce and a whole new breed of quarantine cooks were born out of that experience.But one year later, and two weeks into a brand new lockdown, there is a patina of anxiety and despondence in the air.Covid-19 figures have been soaring for a few weeks now and for most home cooks, there is no longer the thrill of producing all sorts of exotic new meals. In many ways, anxiety has killed both the inspiration and the need for adventurous cooking.Instead the focus has shifted very firmly towards healthy, comforting meals designed to boost immune systems and provide nutrition in spades.What’s cooking?During the first MCO, property developer Raymond Ng, 38, experimented a lot and even used exotic ingredients like hairy crabs and abalone in his meals. This time around, he is sticking to tried-and-tested comfort food, as his focus is on cooking hearty, healthy meals for his family so that everyone remains in good health throughout the pandemic.This is especially important to Ng as not only does he cook for his wife Denise Chong, 37, and two young kids, Rayanne Deanna Ng, 9, and Raydence Devean Ng, 5, he is also responsible for the daily meals of his octogenarian grandparents – Dato Ng Tiong Seng, 88, and Datin Chan Lai Har, 87, who live with him.“Nowadays people have less and less money, so it is not about eating wagyu beef or other luxury foods, I think it is about comfort food. So during these difficult times, my recipes are home-cooked, simple meals like marmite chicken, sweet and sour chicken and fried fish.“For my grandparents, it is even easier to cook for them as they like simple Chinese food like steamed fish and steamed chicken. But I like to satisfy the appetites of everyone at home, so even though I make simple food, sometimes I cook three totally different meals to please my grandparents, wife and kids, ” says Ng, laughing.Ng’s views are echoed by team manager Ezrin Nik Ismail, 38, who says she experimented a lot in the kitchen during the first MCO and was very, very adventurous with her daily meals.But given the sombreness associated with the current lockdown, she has switched focus and with the help of her trusted multi-functional kitchen appliance Thermomix, she now churns out healthy meals for her husband Mohd Izrin, 36, and two kids Mika Danial, 4, and Lana Mariya, 2.“Yeah, it is definitely about building up my family’s immunity. Now that I have a Thermomix, I make everything from scratch. My thinking has changed, I care about what goes into my family’s mouths – I care about how much oil is used in our everyday meals, and in that way, I try not to eat outside food anymore, ” she says.These days, Ezrin says her go-to meals are dishes like chicken rice, soups, pasta and pizza. She also bakes bread and healthy muffins and often gets her kids to help her with the daily cooking to alleviate their boredom, as they are completely housebound.“It’s definitely about comfort food and things that are very easy and simple to prepare. I also like involving the kids in activities like making pizza together, as this is a bonding exercise and my son loves pressing all the buttons on the Thermomix and adding ingredients into the machine, ” he says.Stay-at-home mum Valerie Michael, 38, is also a big believer in healthy, balanced meals and typically makes a variety of dishes that serve her family’s nutritional needs like Chinese-style spinach soup, Indian dhal and pasta dishes. Valerie also uses her air-fryer a lot these days to create healthy fried food for her two young children – Adithya Isaac, 5, and Aryan Micah, 2.“Oh yes, I use the air-fryer for everything from frying ikan bilis to frying fish, so that the kids get healthy fried meals, instead of the usual oil-coated fried fare, ” she says.For other home cooks, the first MCO last year provided the ideal opportunity to learn how to cook more dishes. While some of the more extravagant or unusual fare might have been relegated to one-hit wonders, many wholesome meals have become mainstays now that the current lockdown is in place.Saritha Devi Kirupalani, 36, for example is a lawyer with a hectic work schedule. Because she normally leads such a busy lifestyle, the first MCO actually gave her the chance to widen her cooking repertoire, and she used that time to learn how to make hearty, nutritious dishes like chicken curry and Thai green curry.Although this iteration of the lockdown has been less fruitful from a cooking perspective, Saritha has been able to turn to the recipes she discovered in the first MCO.“I was definitely cooking a lot more during the first MCO, I don’t think I even touched my laptop for an entire week. So that time, I learnt how to make dishes like chicken curry and rasam (Indian tamarind soup). But I think this time around, businesses have learnt how to run on a work-from-home basis, so for me, work is proceeding as normal so I don’t have that much time to focus on trying new things unfortunately, ” she says.Stay-at-home mum Theresa Choo, 66, is one of few home cooks who is churning out more international fare this MCO. But Choo’s goal is relatable: she wants to keep her pandemic-fatigued family happy and nourished, which is why she has been making global food with a healthy slant.“It’s been so long since we travelled anywhere, and the lockdown is another curb to travel, so every meal that I make is to pretend that we are overseas. I have made Japanese sushi, Mexican quesadillas and Thai tom yum during this period. I want to make meal times interesting, so it is something everyone in the family looks forward to during this tough period, ” she says.Choo says having well-balanced meals is important to her, and she puts a lot of effort into making sure her meals are tasty and healthy.“I know what goes into my food, because I am preparing it myself, so I don’t use too much oil and there is always plenty of fibre in every meal. Also my home-cooked meals are not too carb-heavy, because I find that when you order meals from eateries, it is always 80% carbs, ” she says.Fruits galoreNearly everyone I spoke to has made a huge effort to include more fruits in their daily diet, largely to ensure they are in optimal health during the pandemic.This is bolstered by the World Health Organization’s nutrition advice during the pandemic – part of which is to consume two cups of fruits (and 2 ½ cups of vegetables) every day as well as snacks made up of raw vegetables and fruits.So many concerned parents are making huge efforts to inculcate the habit of eating more fruits. Ezrin for example, blends fruits and freezes it into fruit popsicles for her children.Choo meanwhile has a daily dessert platter made up of an assortment of fruits. Saritha on the other hand, started consuming a lot of fruits weeks before her Covid-19 Astra Zeneca vaccination appointment and is now trying to covertly introduce a wider range of fruit into her four year-old daughter Rania Ravenesan’s diet.“I ate a lot of blueberries and other fruits before I got vaccinated and I think that is why I didn’t have any side effects after the jab. And for my daughter, I’ve always tried to ensure she gets her veggies even though she’s a fussy eater. And now I’m trying to get her to eat more fruits. She recently started eating strawberries, which I’m so happy about because before this, she would only eat grapes, ” says Saritha.Tuition teacher Amrawati Narayanan, 68, also takes great care to ensure that she and her daughter Rena Shan, 39, get lots of fruits in their daily diet now, especially as Rena hasn’t had her Covid-19 vaccination yet.“I already got my first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine but Rena hasn’t, so I want to make sure we are both in good health during this lockdown. So we have a lot of fruits in our house and either consume it fresh or as a smoothie, ” she says.Ng has also taken to blending vegetables and fruits into smoothies for his children as he wants to boost their immune systems, given that they are too young to be vaccinated against Covid-19.“My children dislike vegetables and fruits, so now every day, my wife and I blend it with yoghurt and make it into smoothies for them to drink and they like it so much, they ask for more!“Before, we never really ate a lot of fruits. But these days, I watch the news every day for updates on Covid-19 cases and I am always biting my nails from the anxiety. So definitely, eating healthy is my priority right now, ” he says.Food deliveryAlthough most people are trying to cook healthy meals at home as much as possible, sometimes it really isn’t possible to do it every day, especially when work beckons or cooking simply becomes too tiresome.Ezrin for example, allows herself one meal delivery a week, although she tends to hand pick the businesses that focus on quality home-cooked meals that align with her own cooking style.“I still cook a lot but I try to support local businesses because I feel like I want to do my part to help them out. I prefer food made by home businesses in my area, as it is still nice and warm when it arrives, ” she says.Valerie believes that the growing number of people starting home food businesses has also resulted in a parallel number of consumers eager to support these smaller home-hewn establishments making quality meals.“During the pandemic, I have seen a lot of people – including friends of mine – start small businesses selling food, mostly because times are bad and people have had to take pay cuts or sustain job losses. So I think many people are supporting these businesses and it also gives everyone the opportunity to try something different.“Like for me, practically every weekend, I will order food from my sister who has a small business catering home-cooked meals on the weekends, ” she says.Saritha on the other hand, confesses that with her busy work schedule, she does often have to turn to food delivery services for help, especially on days when she doesn’t have the time to cook.“Oh yes, I turn to food delivery portals very, very often. But it also gets to a point where you are sick and tired of it, especially when you see the same food and the same restaurants listed over and over again, and sometimes that is what compels me to cook simple dishes.“Like the other day, I made a Maggi mee goreng with lots of vegetables and prawns, even though I didn’t have much time after work. And that was purely because I was tired of ordering outside food!” she says.For others, safety is so central to everything that they do that ordering meals is now verboten. Ng, for instance, actually co-owns a Japanese eatery and understands the need to support local businesses, but confesses that his desire to protect his family overrides his yearning for outside meals.“I am a restaurant owner too – my restaurant does delivery and takeaway, but for me, home-cooked food is my priority now because I don’t want to get in touch with unnecessary people coming to my house as my grandparents are at home and they are very vulnerable, so I need to take extra safety precautions, ” he says."
"Sunday, 23 May 2021",,Food,CHRIS CHAN,Curious Cook: Eat your nitrate-rich veggies,"This week, there are no hugely surprising news but confirmations of some old research which has been updated and generally validated. I also must confess that I have been busy with work so have not been able to allocate the usual number of hours to research into more esoteric subjects, but the following items should be comforting as there appear to be possible real-life human benefits according to some recent papers.Nitrate-rich vegetables really helpEveryone knows five portions of vegetables and fruit are helpful for maintaining good health. Lots of research have confirmed this. But one might be interested to know that a very recent paper confirmed that around 120 grams of nitrate-rich greens appear to have the most positive impact on heart health. The paper from New Edith Cowan University (ECU) is not new news as it mostly confirmed an earlier 2018 research paper funded by Isagenix International LLC. I had ignored the 2018 paper previously due to possible bias as the sponsors are a multi-level marketing company promoting and selling various dietary supplements.The latest study, ‘Vegetable nitrate intake, blood pressure and incident cardiovascular disease: Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health Study’, released on 4 May 2021 is much more plausible, even though it mostly echoed the 2018 paper. The basic summary is that people who consumed a daily minimum quantity of nitrate-rich vegetables had on average 2.5 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure and a 12% to 26% lower risk of heart disease. These findings were based on a study size of over 50, 000 people in Denmark conducted over 23 years.The main aim of the ECU study was identification of dietary factors which lead to lower incidences of heart disease. The primary finding was very simple: just a daily cup of raw (or half a cup of cooked) nitrate-rich vegetables was determined to have significant cardiovascular benefits. And consuming more than this daily amount (around 120 grams) did not accrue any additional benefits.How nitrate-rich vegetables help with cardiovascular health appeared to be linked with nitric oxide levels. Nitric oxide (NO) production is significantly stimulated through enzymatic-dependent mechanisms during the dietary intake of nitrate-containing foods. NO is a primary vasodilatory factor and it is absorbed from the endothelial cells of the peripheral vasculature where it is accumulated from the digestion of nitrate-rich foods.In summary, raised NO levels in the body arising from adequate consumption of nitrate-rich vegetables is linked to vasodilation, or the widening of the larger blood vessels such as arteries or veins. This factor contributed to a lower incidence of heart disease and reduced levels of hypertension (high blood pressure).NO was determined to be a signalling molecule in the cardiovascular system much earlier on and this discovery had led to a Nobel prize in 1998 for Robert Furchgott, Ferid Murad and Louis Ignarro. Confirmation of the dietary associations with NO were established later.Prior to this, the use of NO was more specific. For example, NO was introduced to cardiac patients via nitroglycerine to improve cardiovascular health, intensive care patients had NO gas included in oxygen ventilation systems to reduce dangerous high blood pressure levels, and NO had also been used to treat erectile dysfunction in men, among other interesting treatments.Another associated paper from ECU published just over a month earlier also indicates that a nitrate-rich vegetable diet improves muscle function in the lower limbs. The study was smaller, on 3, 759 Australians, conducted over 12 years but the findings were very interesting.The results from ‘Dietary Nitrate Intake Is Positively Associated with Muscle Function in Men and Women Independent of Physical Activity Levels’ indicated an 11% improvement in lower limb strength and a 4% faster walking speed for people who consumed higher amounts of nitrate-rich vegetables daily.What was remarkable was the improvements in lower limb strength appeared to occur primarily from the nitrate-rich diet, regardless of the amount of any additional physical activity.Nitrites versus nitratesAt this point, one should note the important difference between synthetic nitrites (and some synthetic nitrates) used as food preservatives (usually in meats) and natural nitrates found in green vegetables. Synthetic nitrites (and some synthetic nitrates) are commonly included in processed meats as preservatives.However, these synthetic nitrogen-based compounds break down into nitrosamines in the human digestive system and over 90% of nitrosamines are determined to be carcinogens of varying gravity. The World Health Organisation had therefore categorised processed meats as Group 1 carcinogens in 2015.If one finds that consumption of foods treated with nitrites is unavoidable, then include at least some other food items with high levels of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) with the meal. This helps prevent the conversion of nitrites in the stomach into nitrosamines.Plant foods with natural nitratesThe plants containing beneficial natural nitrates make up a long list, so it is normally never a huge problem to acquire the daily suggested quantity of nitrates. Some common examples are green, leafy vegetables (like spinach, mustard greens, arugula, kale, Swiss chard and lettuce), beetroot, radishes, turnips, watercress, Chinese greens (such as bok choi, Chinese cabbage, choi sum, etc), kohlrabi, chicory leaf, celery, onion, garlic, etc.Considering the small quantity of consumption of greens required, the health benefits appear to significantly outweigh the marginal costs and efforts involved, especially if one is susceptible to hypertension or some cardiovascular conditions.Chocolate as a (possible) treatment for liver diseasePossibly adding to the good news is a recent April 2021 study that suggested chocolate could be a beneficial treatment for fatty liver disease and inflammation, particularly various liver conditions not associated with alcohol-related damage.It has been claimed for many years that phytochemicals in chocolate such as polyphenols and methylxanthines have health benefits, including reduced risks of cardio-metabolic diseases including stroke, coronary heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, conditions common to obese humans. The impact of chocolate on obese mice was therefore the basis for the study.The study outcomes were remarkably positive. However, it was regrettable the Penn State paper, ‘Dietary cocoa ameliorates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and increases markers of antioxidant response and mitochondrial biogenesis in high fat-fed mice’ did not attempt to identify the compounds in chocolate which were claimed to promote the positive effects on the laboratory mice.Nevertheless, compared to obese mice in the control group which were also kept on excessive diets, the chocolate-treated mice exhibited extremely interesting outcomes after eight weeks, such as 28% lower liver fat levels, 56% lower levels of oxidative stress and 75% lower levels of DNA damage. Curiously, chocolate-treated mice also gained weight at a 21% slower rate.If the same outcomes from the mice experiments can be extrapolated to humans, the health benefits would obviously be immense. From a rational perspective however, the reality is more complicated, and there is currently no guarantee that such mice-related health improvements would apply to people, although the study is hopeful the positive results can translate to humans.The daily dosage of chocolate required was also challenging. In the absence of precise knowledge of the actual effective compounds in chocolate, humans would require about 10 tablespoons of low-sugar cocoa powder every day to match the amount of chocolate administered to the test mice. This large daily quantity of chocolate may be a factor in the results as ingesting so much chocolate might act as an appetite inhibitor, and there is no data offered about this possible suppressant effect.So, although the chocolate study might be good news to humans one day, until the actual active compounds in chocolate are identified, about the only thing one can presently suggest is that it may be an idea to substitute snacks without chocolate with snacks which contain chocolate. This is just a very informal suggestion, by the way, and not a recommendation.The views expressed are entirely the writer’s own"
"Friday, 11 Jun 2021",,Food,IAN LAU,Driven by delectable dumplings,"CHINESE rice dumpling or zongzi, commonly known as chang among locals, has a long tradition steeped in history.Legend has it that poet and minister Qu Yuan, who served during the Zhou Dynasty, was wrongly accused of treason and committed suicide by drowning.The locals could not retrieve his body.Afraid that it would be devoured by river creatures, they threw rice dumplings into the river.From then on, the Dumpling Festival was held annually to remember him.The rice dumplings are wrapped in bamboo leaves and usually contain meat, nuts and beans.There are also vegetarian versions that may contain meat substitutes such as mushrooms, gluten or bean curd.Traditionally, the vegetarian option for chang is the alkaline dumpling or gan sui joong.Alkaline dumpling is so unique in texture and flavour that it is quite difficult to describe to anyone unfamiliar with it.The lye solution that is used to cure the rice, creates dumplings with a distinctive yellow colour, translucent appearance, springy texture and a subtly pungent flavour.There is an exact science in using lye solution, sometimes called lye water or alkali water.It is bottled locally as air abu soda and available at bakery supply shops.For 200g of rice, only half a tablespoon of lye is used.Any less may not be sufficient to cure the rice and any more may cause the rice to taste like soap.The red bean paste recipe is from my mother, who would melt the sugar in the oil to caramelise it before adding the red bean puree.This recipe makes a lot more paste than is needed for the dumplings, so the rest can be stored for mooncakes and steamed buns.I also use it to stuff glutinous rice balls for the winter solstice festival.Rice dumplings need to cool down completely for it to attain a glossy surface, allowing the wrappings to come off easily.Although it can be enjoyed on its own, some people like to serve it with a drizzle of palm sugar.Alkaline dumplings with red bean paste fillingIngredients200g glutinous rice½ tbsp lye solution20 bamboo leaves10 hemp stringsRed bean paste500g adzuki beans6 cups cold water1 cup cooking oil400g granulated sugarMethodFor the bean paste, wash the adzuki beans until water runs clear. If boiling over the stove, soak overnight, then simmer over medium heat for two hours until soft. Use immediately if boiling in a pressure cooker for 40 minutes.With a hand blender, puree red beans until they become a smooth paste. If using a regular blender, add sufficient water to form a smooth paste.Heat oil in a frying pan and add sugar to melt and caramelise in the oil. When sugar has turned a light golden brown, add pureed red beans and stir until the oil and caramel have combined into the red bean paste.Turn off heat and allow to cool completely before rolling out 10 balls of red bean paste about 2cm in diameter. Store excess bean paste in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a week or in the freezer for two months.Wash glutinous rice until water runs clear. Soak rice in cold water overnight or at least four hours. Then drain the rice in a colander or wire sieve and let it drip dry for 30 minutes.Finally, stir in lye solution and let it sit for 30 minutes but no more than two hours.Scrub the bamboo leaves and hemp strings with a brush to get rid of dust and dirt. Place leaves and strings in a pot with sufficient water to submerge and bring to a boil. Then set aside to soak in the water until needed.To assemble the dumplings, overlap two sheets of bamboo leaves and create a cone shape in the middle of the leaves. Fill the cone with one teaspoon of rice, stuff with a ball of red bean paste, then cover with another teaspoon of rice.Push the cone into a triangular shape and cover with the big flap of leaf until it forms a tetrahedron-shaped pyramid. Fold the excess flap against the side of the pyramid and tie firmly with a hemp string.When all the dumplings are properly wrapped, bring a big pot of water to a boil. Then submerge the dumplings in the water, cover with a lid and simmer over medium heat for an hour and 15 minutes.When cooked, remove dumplings from the pot and hang to drip off excess water. Cool completely, for at least an hour. Store at room temperature for no more than three days, or in the refrigerator for a week."

"Tuesday, 08 Jun 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Lifestyle,AGENCY,Eating a cold dish could increase your calorie intake,"Our perception of calorie content can be distorted by the temperature of a dish, whether warm or cold.This could lead us to eat more.According to a study from France, our brain perceives a cold dish to be lighter in calories than a warm dish.The majority of people who choose a cold dish tend to consume more calories (+31%), fat (+37%) and carbohydrates (+22%).But how can this unconscious decision made by our brain be explained?To answer this question, three researchers from Grenoble Ecole de Management conducted a survey of 2,600 French, American and Brazilian adults of all ages.One of the study’s authors, Amanda Pruski Yamim, offered a first element of explanation for this observation in a press release.“In most cultures, warm foods are considered filling and play an important role in the day’s main meals.“This perception comes from the fact that humans digest hot foods more easily and expect warm food to be tastier,” she outlines.And so for a tastier meal, we are willing to pay more.The study reports that survey participants would be willing to pay up to 25% more for a food item when it was served (or simply labelled) hot.“These observations are essential for people with weight problems or suffering from obesity,” says the researcher, who advises adding a warm food item to a cold dish to increase the feeling of satiety. – AFP RelaxnewsOrder hot and healthy food straight to your doorsteps at wallet friendly prices with foodpanda Promo Code"
"Friday, 04 Jun 2021",8:00 PM MYT,Lifestyle,MICHAEL CHEANG,"Tipsy-Turvy: What is a cocktail shaker, and other tools of the bartending trade?","Well, here we are, stuck at home again. I guess it’s back to making drinks at home again, huh?Well, since we’ve already covered what sorts of spirits, liqueurs, and syrups you should have in your home bar, let us now talk about the sort of tools you need to recreate your favourite cocktails at home.Now, before we get into the sorts of bar tools that are out there, it should be pointed out that you don’t HAVE to get these tools for your home, as there are plenty of utensils in your kitchen that can be used for the same purpose. For instance, a cookie jar can be used as a cocktail shaker, baking measuring spoons can replace jiggers, a chopstick can stir a drink just as well as a fancy bar spoon... well, you get the picture.However, while these replacements will get your drink made, they don’t offer the same experience as using some proper bar tools.“We feel that having the right tools will give you more joy and better results in what you are making, ” says Nathan Pinto, co-founder of The 4 Barmen, a Malaysian startup that specialises in making good quality and affordable bar tools.“Sure, you can mix cocktails using a water jug at home, however, with a proper cocktail shaker, you have better control when mixing and shaking drinks with finesse.“Working with ‘make-do’ tools will get the job done, but using proper tools, the whole experience will be exceptionally better and becomes more fun. The results also taste and look better, ” Pinto adds.The 4 Barmen was formed when the four founders – who are cocktail enthusiasts, but not professional bartenders – realised that the options for bar tools in the Malaysian market were limited. Hence, they decided to take matters into their own hands and set up a store offering high quality bar tools and glassware at a reasonable price, with more elegant finishes, in order to inspire Malaysians to create more cocktails at home. Their store includes three levels of Starter kits suitable for home bartenders, depending on the skill level of the user.With that in mind, let’s learn about the different sorts of bartools and what they are used for, with some help from bartender Shawn Chong of the Mizukami Collective and Bar Class Academy Asia.ShakerThe primary function of a shaker is to mix, chill, aerate, and dilute a cocktail. There are two main types of shakers that are commonly used in bars – the Cobbler and the Boston.The main difference between the two is obviously the shape and size. Also known as a three-piece shaker, the Cobbler is the one that looks like a little metal bottle, while the larger Boston shaker is commonly made up of two large vessels, usually made of metal, though some are a combination of metal and glass vessels.“A Cobbler shaker generally fits one or two drinks depending on volume, while a Boston can accommodate three to four, ” Chong says.“The Boston shaker is also more efficient in making drinks that have solid items like fruit, herbs and spices as well as well drinks that call for cream or dairy. The space in the shaker eases the frothing capability.”According to him, the Boston shaker is also more versatile as open vessels are easier and faster to clean, so a Boston Shaker wins on hygiene.The cobbler shaker, on the other hand, has an in-built strainer at the top and so is favourable for cocktails that don't call for any fresh herbs, purees or pulp.JiggerWith a distinctive hourglass shape, the jigger is a bartenders' measuring tool.“Just like baking, accuracy is required to create balanced cocktails by respecting the proportions a recipe calls for. It's far faster and more efficient than using a scale, though a scale would win at point accuracy, ” says Chong.Mixing GlassA mixing glass is used to stir a cocktail rather than shake it, as this allows you to maintain better control over the amount of dilution, and also maintain the texture and viscosity of the drink better.Sure, you can just use a normal glass or a jar to mix drinks, but many bartenders tend to use specially crafted mixing glasses. This is not just for the aesthetics – some professional mixing glasses, like the Yarai mixing glass (named after the Japanese diamond pattern etched on the outside) are made with a heavy base, uses thicker glass, has a spout at the top for easy pouring, and the pattern at the side makes it easier to hold while using.Bar spoonA spoon is just a spoon, right? Well, not when it’s a bar spoon. “While its primary function is for stirring cocktails, It can also be used to measure smaller quantities instead of using a jigger, as a bar spoon usually measures three to four millilitres of liquid, ” says Chong.A bar spoon can also be used for layering spirits on top of one another, either by pouring the spirit over the underside of the spoon, or by using the spiral stem.Some bar spoons also either come with a fork on the other end (which can be used for skewering garnishes or squeezing citrus directly from fruit wedges), or a muddler. Which brings us to...MuddlerThe muddler is used to crush fruits, herbs or spices to extract its flavour properties. The size of the muddler doesn't matter, though a larger one usually requires less effort.StrainerBartenders commonly use two types of strainers – Hawthorne strainers and conventional mesh strainers.A Hawthorne strainer is usually paired with a Boston shaker to hold muddled items and ice, as the ice shouldn't be reused once a drink is made. It commonly comes with prongs that sit at the lip of the shaker.""A Hawthorne Strainer with no prongs serves the same purpose but is very useful for bartenders to use the ‘throw’ technique,"" says Chong. ""The throw technique allows for a slower dilution rate than shaking and more aeration than stirring yielding a different end result to a cocktail.""According to Chong, most of the time, a normal mesh strainer would be sufficient for straining your drinks, but there are times when you need to ‘fine strain’ it as well.Fine straining means using both a Hawthorne Strainer AND a mesh strainer together in order to effectively remove any smaller particles that a Hawthorne can't hold back. It is also used to ensure a nice smooth froth/foam should the cocktail need it.Bar bladeA bar blade is a bottle opener that's meant for high volume bars where bottled drinks like beer are served a lot, according to Chong.“Its length usually causes the blade protrude from a bartender's pocket for easy access and with a long blade it creates a better fulcrum making it easier to open the caps. The long blade also allows bartenders to do tricks/flair in hopes to earn some tips!” he says.Snag extra discounts on your bartending tools with Lazada Discount CodeMichael Cheang used to shake cocktails using a plastic cookie jar.

"Tuesday, 25 May 2021",,Food,,Crispy goose for vegetarians,"VEGETARIAN goose got its name not because it tastes like goose meat but because of its crispy texture that resembles the skin of roast goose.It is made completely out of foo pei, or bean curd skin, and is seasoned with a mixture of red fermented bean curd and five spice powder.It is said to have been invented by Buddhist monks in Hangzhou, China, and is one of the first vegetarian dishes that, although having a meat moniker, doesn’t really mimic the real thing – unlike many other mock meats.It is not often prepared at home because not many people like to deep-fry, so it is usually bought ready-made.However, it is not really difficult to make because it only contains a few ingredients, and the oil can be reused for other dishes.The most important step is to keep your packages neat without the raw edges of the bean curd skin breaking into the oil.This is done by folding the edges of the bean curd skin towards the centre until you get a package that has all the raw edges tucked into a narrow rectangle.Then secure the packages with toothpicks so they do not open up when frying.Some recipes give instructions to poke holes into the packages before frying to release the air bubbles.I find this method allows too much oil to penetrate into the folds of the packages, making it crispy all the way inside but very greasy.I prefer to puncture the bubbles as they emerge so that it’s less greasy and still soft inside.Unless you can multitask, I recommend frying the packages one at a time so that the oil temperature doesn’t lower too much and it is easier to handle any erupting bubbles.The vegetarian goose should be consumed immediately although it can stay crispy for a few hours.If left out for too long, it can be made crispy again in a toaster oven at 150°C for 10 minutes, but it should not be fried again.You may serve it as an appetiser with a sweet Thai chilli sauce.Vegetarian gooseIngredients3 sheets bean curd skin3 cups cooking oilsweet chilli sauceMarinade3 cubes red fermented beancurd150ml cold water1½ tsp icing sugar½ tsp light soy sauce½ tsp five spice powderMethodIn a small bowl, break up bean curd cubes with a little water before adding in the remaining water. Add sugar, soy sauce and five spice powder and whisk together until combined.Spread open the bean curd skins and arrange on a countertop.Stack them neatly one on top of the other and cut into quarters with kitchen shears.Take one quarter sheet of bean curd skin and brush the marinade seasoning all over the surface.Place another sheet on top and brush lightly with a layer of marinade.Fold the long ends of the bean curd sheet to meet in the centre, then fold in the sides, making sure that the raw edges are tucked into the inside of the bean curd package.Use toothpicks to secure both ends and one in the centre to hold the piece in place. Then continue to brush and fold remaining sheets until you get six bean curd packages.The final packages should measure about 7x20cm, each consisting of about 16 layers of bean curd skin.Heat oil in a frying pan and deep-fry packages one at a time until golden brown.Use a bamboo skewer to puncture the packages as you fry so that the bubbles do not suddenly burst and splatter oil all over the place.Remove toothpicks after frying, cut into slices and serve immediately with sweet chilli sauce.Get your favourite vegetarian meals delivered to your doorstep.

"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Tech,,Ceiling-mounted Covid 'alarm' warns if someone in a room is infected,"What if there was a non-invasive way to tell if someone in the room with you is infected with the coronavirus?British scientists say they have developed a ceiling-mounted Covid ""alarm"" that can detect anyone infected in as little as 15 minutes.The Sunday Times reports the highly accurate device, slightly larger than a smoke alarm, is being hailed as a potential boon for screening in aircraft cabins, classrooms, care homes and offices.Early studies by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Durham University have shown the device has an accuracy of 98-100%, making is as reliable as gold-standard PCR lab-based Covid-19 tests and considerably more so than quick lateral flow tests.The researchers stress that their results are at an early stage, with their work published in a paper that is yet to be peer-reviewed.The sensor, made by Cambridgeshire firm Roboscientific, works by detecting chemicals produced by the skin or present in the breath of those infected with coronavirus.These ""volatile organic compounds"" create odour too subtle to be sniffed by the human nose. A study by the Covid alarm's research team showed they could be detected by dogs, but the alarm would be more accurate and more practical.The Sunday Times says the detectors could find people with the virus even if they were yet to show symptoms, making it more effective than PCR tests, which have been found inadequate for asymptomatic carriers.It takes 15 to 30 minutes for the machines to sample the air in a large room, with the results sent instantly to a mobile phone or computer.At present, the sensors would cost around 5,000 pounds (RM28,730.80) each, the paper says. – dpa"

However ""inadequate privacy disclosures"" often hinder users ""from making informed choices,"" said the Macquarie researchers, who compared 15,000 health, medical and fitness apps with a sample of 8,000 others.While the health apps gathered less user data than others, around two-thirds of them still ""could collect advert identifiers or cookies"" and a quarter could ""identify the mobile phone tower to which a user's device is connected.""A quarter of the apps violated their own privacy polices, according to the BMJ research, with as many again either not providing any such terms in the first place or having ""user data transmissions"" occur via ""insecure communication channels.""Almost 90% of ""data collection operations"" more than half of the data transmission ""were behalf of third party services, such as external advertisers, analytics, and tracking providers,"" the researchers found.Concerns about data security, particularly in ""sensitive"" areas such as health, have soared in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic and the deployment by dozens of governments, many of them authoritarian, of pandemic-related tracing apps.Worries have been heightened by the growing threat of cyberattack, with Ireland's health service crippled in May by a hack that has left the country in the dark about coronavirus-linked deaths and has seen personal health information leaked onto the so-called dark web. – dpa"
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Tech,BERNADETTE WINTER,Learning a musical instrument by app: How well does it really work?,"The pandemic might have given us many of us more time to learn a new instrument, but it also limited our options for one-on-one lessons during social distancing. How well can learning apps compete with a real teacher?Whatever you dream of playing, from Foo Fighters to ""Fuer Elise,"" countless apps and and online programs promise to help you easily learn get to grips with new chords and scales.But anyone looking around on the app store will quickly notice there are too many options out there. At the same time, you might be wondering: Can they really compete with a human teacher?Some apps take a light-hearted approach, enabling you to hit the right notes in the order, and to the right rhythm, on a virtual keyboard on your smartphone or tablet.That is not the same as a real instrument, says Volker Gerland, who works for an association of music schools in Germany. ""The pressure point is missing,"" he says. ""The size of the keys is also different on tablets.""You may run into difficulties later on if you are hoping to switch from these digital instruments to real ones, he says, adding that isn't the best way to learn how to play the guitar.Lots of video tutorials are available online, some of them free of charge, and you can find them on the main platforms. There are even whole academies for bass players, for example, with world-class stars giving master classes, says Martin Reche of Germany's Heise online, a platform that reviews apps and devices.A series of apps help people to learn the piano, such as Skoove, Music2Me or Flowkey for learning piano, while for the guitar, there are Yousician, Fretello or JustinGuitar.Some of those apps can actively listen and provide feedback, according to Reche who tested a series of them, while others only provide a video but no feedback.For the guitar, apps offer a virtual fretboard that extends across the screen. Yousician listens to you through the built-in microphones and can tell if you're hitting the right note at the right time. ""That's how you learn to find your way around the fretboard and play melodies,"" Reche says.Apps teaching the piano work in a similar way.There are notes along the bottom of the screen, and at the top, users see a bird's-eye view of a virtual teacher's piano. It shows the fingering too, explaining which finger should hit which note and when.""If you've always wanted to learn to play an instrument and have a small keyboard at home, for example, the apps can help you as you're starting out,"" says Reche.You might boost your motivation by playing famous pop tunes, for example - though the apps cover Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, too.But all these services can't replace a teacher, Reche says.""They can judge whether you've played notes correctly and hit the timing, but not finger or body position.""In the worst case scenario, if you develop a poor posture or style and there's no one around to correct it, you may wind up hampering your own progress.""Learning an instrument just by watching videos or taking lessons online I think is very problematic,"" Gerland says. He says the poor sound quality is one factor, while also, teachers can't play well with their students online.But the apps may be good as a supplementary way to support your musical education or brush up rusty skills if it's been a while since you played, he says.Many music schools have been offering digital coaching throughout the pandemic, with lessons through videoconferences or by providing videos explaining exercises.Students typically respond by sending audio recordings for teachers to assess - which are always a good way to keep in touch and provide feedback between meetings in person.Reche notes that all the apps he tried out for mobile devices and browsers cost money. However, all offered a seven-day trial period where users could explore all the content.""That's enough time for you to get a good idea of what they offer and work out whether their services are the right ones for you,"" says Reche.Which apps are good for practising?Apps for learning musical instruments cost roughly US$10 to US$20 a month (RM41 to RM82), and annual subscriptions are often cheaper. Before deciding on a version, it is worth checking whether the app is compatible with the device and operating system you want to practise with.Martin Reche, a tester from consumer magazine Heise online in Germany, has reviewed various solutions and reports. ""None of the tested providers did badly,"" he said. Flowkey and Yousician, for example, listened to what and how you play. Music2me, on the other hand, was the only piano-learning app in the test that also takes the piano pedal gallery into account.Skoove, on the other hand, offers the option of practising on the on-screen keyboard in the iOS app, for example on holiday. If you want to learn notes quickly, Fretello is a good choice, says Reche. JustinGuitar, on the other hand, most closely resembles ""real"" lessons. – dpa"
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Tech,ANJA SOKOLOW,Are games in children's learning apps harmless or addictive?,"Complete tasks, earn coins, create avatars: Learning apps often link education with games. But not all experts and parents agree that this fun rewards system makes sense.Add, subtract or practise English on the computer - even before the pandemic, learning apps for pupils were an addition to school lessons. But in coronavirus times, they have at times become a substitute for them.""Especially when the schools were shut from one day to the other, Anton was my salvation,"" says a primary school pupil from the district of Neukoelln in Berlin about the Anton app, which was developed in the German capital and is one of the most used.Pupils can use Anton to do exercises at home sent by the teachers. Many say that learning this way is fun, because they get instant feedback and rewards in the form of virtual coins for correct answers. With these coins, the pupils can play computer games or dress their avatars.But some parents are concerned about this rewards system. ""My six-year-old son had never had anything to do with computer games. But through homeschooling, of all things, he has started shooting asteroids. Is this necessary?"" says a Berlin mother.Another parent, a father, thinks it is questionable to constantly reward children. ""Don't they like learning on their own accord?"" he asks.Chidren lack the motivation to learn on their ownAccording to Heinz-Peter Meidinger, head of the German teachers' association, everything that encourages children to engage with school-related things outside of lessons is positive.""But games are not an intrinsic motivation for children to learn on their own accord,"" Meidinger says.Connecting learning and play may be clever, says Christian Gross, spokesperson of the association for media addiction. ""Entry is being made easy especially for children who are already into computer games,"" he says.""What we're offering are simply mini-games,"" says David Hoermeyer, head of the firm Solocode, which developed Anton. Many games promote concentration and have pedagogic value. ""If they kids really want to play computer games, they don't do that with Anton.""In Hoermeyer's view, the games are a small incentive that is not interesting for everybody, as some kids don't care fore the games.Other learning programmes also work with rewards, such as the language-learning app Duolinguo, where users can also win virtual coins to unlock new levels. In the app Kekula, children can earn coins that they can exchange for YouTube videos, and Scoyo promises coins in exchange for crafting blueprints or avatars to raise spirits.Not a viable long-term model""Someone who is learning out of interest and joy is quickly trained to learn for a reward,"" says addiction therapist Gross. Later, if the reward does not happen anymore, this can lead to frustration and, in the worst case, to children not wanting to learn anymore at all.""In the long term it is not a good model at all to induce young people to performance or learning. It would make more sense to promote certain talents or a specific enthusiasm without constant instant rewards,"" Gross says.The development of the Anton app was funded by the EU European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Berlin Senate. According to the authorities, it is one of the most used learning apps in Germany, although the developers don't publish user statistics.Teaching association president Meidinger estimates that several thousands of schools are using Anton in Germany. He would welcome a scientific assessment of the app, especially since it was funded by the state, and says that studies and research are being planned.Developers reject criticism""We are getting much more positive than negative feedback,"" Hoermeyer says. An what is more, if teachers or parents don't like the games, they can easily switch them off.""Some parents report that their children are very motivated when learning with the app. If we had received a lot of negative feedback, we would have already updated the games section,"" Hoermeyer says.Teachers also have a good overview and can assess whether the games are a distraction or a motivation, Hoermeyer is convinced. A teacher in Neukoelln, meanwhile, has nothing against it: ""The reward system with the computer game is surely motivating.""""We expect that there will be less digital learning when schools open again,"" Hoermeyer says. He also does not believe that sitting in front of the computer all day is the right approach.""We are not doing this to replace school, but provide a useful supplement to what it the greatest asset of school, and that's the personal contact between pupils and teachers,"" he says.The mother from Berlin can confirm this experience. Since the beginning of lessons after lockdown, the situation at her home has relaxed and there are no more discussions about computer games.""After two months without Anton, and with alternating (in-person and at-home) lessons, he is not asking about the games anymore."" — dpa"
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",3:30 PM MYT,Tech,,Pressure on Pornhub grows after 34 women sue,"MONTREAL: Pornhub has been increasingly under the gun as the adult video site was sued this week by 34 women who say they appeared without consent in footage showing rape, sexual abuse, revenge porn or images of them when they were minors.“This is a case about rape, not pornography,” the plaintiffs said in the statement of claim, describing the website as “likely the largest non-regulatory repository of child pornography in North America and well beyond”.Their lawyers accuse MindGeek, the controversial adult entertainment empire that runs Pornhub, of being a “classic criminal enterprise” with a business model based on exploiting non-consensual sexual content.According to the suit, which was filed in California, MindGeek owns more than 100 pornographic sites, including Pornhub, RedTube, Tube8 and YouPorn, and sees some 3.5 billion visits each month.“I’m hoping (the lawsuit) will motivate Pornhub, and then also the other companies in this industry, to put in safety measures so that this doesn’t happen to anybody else,” one of the plaintiffs, who identified herself as Rachel, told AFP on Friday.The 38-year-old Canadian, who spoke on condition that her real name not be used, recently recounted to AFP her years-long struggle to have removed from the Internet a video of her being sexually assaulted by her own husband as she lay unconscious, and later posted to Pornhub without her consent.Although Pornhub took the video down, it had already spread to countless other sites.‘Monumental day’“Today is a monumental day,” commented Laila Mickelwait of the Traffickinghub campaign to shut down Pornhub and hold its executive accountable, backed by 2.2 million people who signed an online petition.“This lawsuit makes it clear that Pornhub and its parent company Mindgeek are not just a tech company that makes a (content) moderation mistakes,” the sex trafficking expert said in a video message on Twitter.The porn giant has faced a growing backlash since the New York Times published an article in December 2020 in which Pornhub was accused of posting illegal content online, including child pornography and rape videos – which it has denied.“Why does Canada host a company that inflicts rape videos on the world?,” said its author Nicholas Kristof, noting that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau self-identifies as a feminist.The public outcry led Canadian lawmakers in February to grill MindGeek executives about alleged abuses, while Mastercard and Visa suspended payments on Pornhub. The two payments processing companies are also named in the suit, accused of having “knowingly” profiting from trafficking in providing merchant services to MindGeek.On Thursday, a Canadian parliamentary committee released 14 recommendations for regulating online platforms – including requiring them to verify the age and consent of all persons depicted in porn videos – while the Trudeau administration works on a new law that would force sites to swiftly remove illegal content.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police is also reviewing a call by victims of sexual exploitation backed by more than 70 Canadian lawmakers for a criminal investigation of Mindgeek.In recent months, Pornhub has announced a series of measures to combat illegal content, including allowing only users whose identity has been verified to upload content, and using artificial intelligence to help detect illegal videos.On Thursday, Montreal-based MindGeek described the suit’s accusation that it is running a “criminal enterprise” as “utterly absurd, completely reckless and categorically false”, according to US media. – AFP"
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",3:20 PM MYT,Tech,,"34 women sue Pornhub in sex abuse video, trafficking case","LOS ANGELES: Nearly three dozen women have filed a lawsuit in California against adult video website Pornhub, accusing it and its parent company of knowingly profiting from footage depicting rape and sexual exploitation, including of minors.Lawyers representing the 34 plaintiffs accuse the online giant – one of the world’s largest adult video websites – of creating a teeming marketplace for child pornography and “every other form” of nonconsensual sexual content, and want the company to pay damages.They accuse MindGeek, the controversial adult entertainment empire that runs Pornhub, of being a “classic criminal enterprise” with a business model based on exploiting non-consensual sexual content.“This is a case about rape, not pornography,” the complaint said, describing the website as “likely the largest non-regulatory repository of child pornography in North America and well beyond”.All but one of the plaintiffs, who reside both in the United States and abroad, wished to remain anonymous.Fourteen said they were minors when they were filmed and should be considered “a victim of child sex trafficking”.Michael Bowe, a lawyer representing the women, told CBS News the court could order MindGeek to pay hundreds of millions to his clients.Serena Fleites, the only plaintiff to be named, said that in 2014 she learned that “a nude, sexually explicit video” that her boyfriend had coerced her to make when she was only 13 years old had been uploaded to Pornhub without her consent.The video remained online until the teen, posing as her mother, asked Pornhub to remove it.Yet the video was not taken down for several weeks, the lawsuit said, and during that time it was downloaded and reuploaded by several different users, with each video requiring a fresh request to remove it.The plaintiffs’ lawyers accuse MindGeek of operating a “gaslighting campaign” online in a bid to discredit the victims, as well as making “threats of physical violence and death” against them.They are also suing Visa Inc – one of the world’s largest payments processing companies – for “knowingly” profiting from trafficking in providing merchant services to MindGeek.Both Visa and Mastercard suspended processing payments for Pornhub in December, after a New York Times article accused the site of hosting illegal content, including child pornography and rape videos.According to the suit, MindGeek owns more than 100 pornographic sites, including Pornhub, RedTube, Tube8 and YouPorn, and sees some 3.5 billion visits each month.Montreal-based MindGeek described the suit’s accusation that it is running a “criminal enterprise” as “utterly absurd, completely reckless and categorically false”, according to US media.Pornhub, which claims 130 million visitors a day, has denied allegations of trafficking and announced a series of measures to combat illegal content. – AFP"

The range of panels, which cost €30 (RM147), is to be expanded over time, says Ikea manager Stjepan Begic.For now, anyone who wants their walls to be alive with the sound of music also needs to share Ikea's taste in art.The picture's hidden purpose becomes clear once you see the power cable running from the bottom of it, something that is tricky to hide when hanging the frame from a wall.The speakers themselves cost €179 (RM882) and are set to go on sale on July 15. Despite being just 6cm thick, they have enough volume for powerful sound, promises Sonos manager Chris Davies.The picture speakers can be controlled via the Sonos app and also support Apple's Airplay 2 transmission technology. Two frames can also be connected to form a stereo pair.One power outlet is sufficient because the speakers also have a power output for the second device. The concept is best suited for small living rooms says Begic. – dpa"
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",8:00 AM MYT,Tech,PHILIPP SCHULTE,"Like it or not, Facebook is still around — but who's still on it?","No other major social media network has weathered as many scandals and shrugged off as much criticism. Even as Facebook's active user base starts to decline in some countries, is this giant just too big to fail?There are more than 2.5 billion Facebook users worldwide, making it by far the largest social media platform online today.But swamped by fake news and annoying posts, some users, especially younger ones, are turning away from Facebook, migrating to other platforms such as Instagram – a Facebook subsidiary – or TikTok, leaving behind an older user base. Even if they still maintain a profile, fewer of these users are logging in and using it actively.So why do some people stay on Facebook and others go? What inspires them to log in these days? Journalist Daniel Fiene says that if it were up to Facebook, users would have to log in to communicate with friends and family. ""However, for most users, Facebook doesn't even have that function anymore,"" as people instead communicate in a family chat on WhatsApp - another Facebook property - or Instagram.""Many users use the platform as a way to manage contacts and to learn about events,"" explains Fiene.Facebook benefits in this respect from its large user base, which according to media trainer Teja Adams, is the network's biggest advantage over the others. Facebook is aimed at nearly all groups of users, which is why it's ""the network where you have always had the best chances of meeting friends and acquaintances,"" explains Adams.Facebook also offers the widest range of functions compared to other networks: Users can chat, post on other's walls or join a group, says Adams. One popular function is events, which allows private users and businesses and organisations to create a page where people can show their interest in attending, ask questions or learn more information.And Facebook groups in particular also continue to draw in users, says Adams. ""For every topic, no matter how specific, you can find the right group on Facebook,"" he says. And not only online, but also near where the user physically lives - allowing face-to-face contact.Facebook has added more and more basic functions to the platform in the past few years, such as gaming, live videos or the marketplace. There are a variety of different functions now within Facebook that appeal to different target groups. ""But there is no longer a function that is a unique selling point to Facebook or is wildly popular.""There are problems in other areas as well: Several central functions no longer work as well, says Adams. Facebook's newsfeed, for example, which is actually the lifeblood of the platform, is now overwhelmed by posts from people other than friends, making it less attractive.""But Facebook won't die so quickly,"" says Adams reassuredly. The network is too big and too deeply integrated into our daily lives.He also believes the user base will stay stable; even if new, younger users stay away, there are always potential new user groups among older folks. And the network is constantly trying to grow its bases, most recently with a whole array of brand-new audio functions.In the past, Facebook has faced criticism for its opaque default settings and misleading design in the user interface. ""Through its design, Facebook should more strongly enable users to make good decisions,"" says media researcher Matthias C Kettemann.Dark patterns – user interfaces that are intended to entice users to disclose private data or spend more time on the network than they'd like – should especially be looked at critically, says Kettemann.Facebook has made some improvements in recent years, especially in the face of legal initiatives such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. ""While privacy settings on Facebook were pretty low to start with, they are now higher by default,"" he adds. – dpa"
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",11:00 AM MYT,Tech,ANDREJ SOKOLOW,"After user exodus, WhatsApp promises new privacy features","In the wake of a major controversy over changes to user rules, WhatsApp is recommitting itself to full encryption and holding out the prospect of new features to protect user privacy.These include the possibility of sending messages that can only be viewed once by the recipient. This could be useful, for example, if you need to send a password to family members, WhatsApp boss Will Cathcart says.It will also be possible to set chats to disappear on their own after a certain time. People on the whole don't want their messages to stay forever, Cathcart argues, pointing out that we don't carry a recording device with us when we talk.The Facebook-owned company has launched an ad campaign for radio, TV and billboards aimed at improving its reputation in privacy.In the UK and Germany, key markets in Europe, short promotional videos will say that content sent on WhatsApp is only visible in plain text to the users involved, thanks to end-to-end encryption.WhatsApp has more than 2 billion users. In recent months, however, the service has had to contend with criticism and an exodus of users following the announcement of new usage rules which came into force in mid-May.The planned changes to the rules sparked outrage on social media, when many interpreted them as saying that more data would be shared with parent company Facebook.WhatsApp rejected this as a misunderstanding and repeatedly stressed that the end-to-end encryption, with which the service itself also has no access to content, would not be changed.However the damage control could not stop users switching to other messaging apps, and rivals like Telegram and Signal noted record user sign-ups in the wake of the scandal.Many users meanwhile became more aware that WhatsApp collects information about how they use their phone and where they are — information that could be used to let its parent company Facebook create a better picture of them for advertising.WhatsApp chief Cathcart acknowledges mistakes were made in announcing the new rules. ""We need to communicate clearly what we are doing and why,"" he says, admitting that WhatsApp only became clearer once ""the confusion"" took place. ""That's on us.""He says WhatsApp had planned an advertising campaign for end-to-end encryption before the recent backlash, but after the controversy in recent months, WhatsApp has even more reason to talk about it.In the meantime, an overwhelming majority of users who had already been asked for their consent to the new rules had accepted them, Cathcart says.He did not give exact figures. Originally, users who did not agree to the new rules were supposed to lose access to basic functions over time. In the meantime, they no longer face any consequences.Only the new functions for communicating with companies can be used after agreeing to the update. According to WhatsApp, they were the central reason for the change in the terms of use.Cathcart criticises that some governments have been trying to soften encryption in chat services, and hopes over time governments will realise that the most important role they can play is to provide more security by standards for businesses.WhatsApp argues to governments that end-to-end encryption helps protect citizens' security. Facebook remains committed to its plan to bring full encryption to its second chat service, Messenger, as the next step, Cathcart said.In several countries, attempts are underway by governments and authorities to undermine full encryption in chat services such as WhatsApp, while government bodies in many countries are able to monitor traditional SMS messages.Government security officials meanwhile say that locking them out of all online communications prevents them from monitoring the activities of criminals and extremists.Recently, however, international police authorities succeeded in striking a major blow against organised crime with the help of a chat app, of all things, after investigators succeeded in establishing their allegedly secure app as a communication channel in criminal circles. – dpa"
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",11:00 AM MYT,Tech,,Electric auto startups hit speed bumps after heady debuts,"Several electric auto startups that raised large sums from investors in the wake of Tesla's ascent are hitting potholes as they pursue next-generation vehicles.The most recent crisis occurred at Lordstown Motors, which announced Monday the sudden departure of two top executives after warning last week it needed more capital to keep operating.Company officials plan a series of events dubbed ""Lordstown Week"" later this month to shore up investor support.But local government officials are not sure what to make of the company, which had discussed adding more than 2,000 jobs in a region plagued by plant closures.""Am I confident? Not as much as I was a week ago,"" Lordstown Mayor Arno Hill said earlier this week. ""We're waiting and seeing what the next step is.""There have been similar leadership shakeups in at least two other electric auto companies that recently went public, raising questions about the transactions and underscoring the difficulties startups face in competing in the capital-intensive industry.""It's definitely more challenging for a small company,"" said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds.com, pointing to heavy spending needed to build and maintain factories and obtain key components.""It does seem like Tesla is an overnight success story, which is not really the case,"" she told AFP. ""But they came in and disrupted the space amongst automotive companies that have been around for decades. Everyone wants to believe that the dream could happen.""Lordstown's woes come in the wake of significant electric vehicle (EV) announcements since the November US presidential election from Ford, General Motors and other auto giants, intensifying competition.Rising costsLordstown Motors was launched by Steve Burns in November 2019 after the acquisition of a recently-shuttered Ohio auto plant owned by GM.The company raised US$675mil (RM2.79bil) following an October 2020 merger with DiamondPeak Holdings, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) — essentially a shell company set up to merge with an operating business.Lordstown Motors unveiled its flagship ""Endurance"" all-electric pickup truck in June 2020 when then-vice president Mike Pence visited its Ohio factory, nearly a year before Ford would present its all-electric F-150 pickup.Lordstown's share price topped US$30 (RM124.28) in February of this year, but the company's fortunes began shifting in March, when short-selling firm Hindenburg Research released a damning report that called Lordstown a ""mirage.""On Monday, Lordstown announced the resignation of Burns and Chief Financial Officer Julio Rodriguez after an investigation concluded Hindenburg's appraisal was ""in significant respects, false and misleading,"" while acknowledging that some of its own statements about vehicle pre-orders were ""in certain respects, inaccurate.""That followed Lordstown's June 8 disclosure that it lacks sufficient capital to begin commercial production, and warned about its ability to keep operating.The company's capital spending had swelled in part from ""stress that the Covid-19 pandemic has put on the global automotive supply chain,"" according to a securities filing.Lordstown shares tumbled after Monday's leadership shakeup, but rallied Tuesday after its executives reaffirmed plans during a Detroit event to begin production in September, pointing to ""firm"" orders from clients, according to news reports.In a securities filing Thursday, Lordstown clarified some of those remarks, saying that purchase agreements ""provide us with a significant indicator of demand"" but ""do not represent binding purchase orders.""Unfair advantage?Lordstown is hardly the only EV prospect to stumble after going public through a SPAC. These types of transactions — which allow companies to enter markets more quickly than with a traditional initial public offering (IPO) — have soared over the last year.Usha Rodrigues, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, has described SPACs as a ""Vegas wedding IPO"" because a legal loophole gives them protection from lawsuits if their forecasts are not met — which traditional IPOs do not enjoy.EV startups that benefited from SPACs now appear prone to turbulence. Nikola suffered its own crisis last fall when its founder suddenly resigned following fraud allegations.The CEO and co-founder of Canoo resigned in April, while Lucid Motors in February delayed production of its EV sedan days after announcing a transaction valuing the company at US$11.75bil (RM48.67bil).Going public through a SPAC may have resulted in some companies getting funds ""before they deserved it,"" Karl Brauer at Carexpert.com said. ""While there's nothing wrong with the SPAC process itself, if it leads to premature funding of a company, it's more likely the company will fail.""Brauer noted that Tesla needed 15 years to become profitable, adding ""this is a long, dedicated process, one you can't short cut with a quick infusion of cash."" – AFP"
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",10:00 AM MYT,Tech,FABIAN HOBERG,Rear view cameras - giving your car eyes in the back of its head,"Parking in a tight space can get really stressful. As you manoeuvre and strain your neck to see through the rear window, impatient drivers back up behind you and honk their horns. Wouldn't it all be easier if you had a camera to help?In many new cars, even small and inexpensive ones, they now come as standard, and others offer them as optional extras. They are positioned near the number plate and automatically turn on when you engage the reverse gear.In vans and motorhomes — vehicles whose rear end position is often a matter of guesswork — cameras are often mounted at the back of the roof. Cameras as assistance systems can not only help with parking but also manoeuvring with trailers.The advantages are not only simple and safe handling, especially for large and confusing vehicles, but also increased safety, says the Robert Nitsche, an electronics expert from Germany. ""With cameras, car drivers can see the parking space exactly,"" he says, ""and they can also see children, animals and any other obstacles.""Quite simply, they make parking much easier, says Michael Zeitler, an automotive electronics specialist, and they're easy to fit on most cars — usually on the handle of the boot or on the number plate bracket.""If the entertainment system can process video signals and has a monitor, only the camera needs to be retro-fitted,"" says Zeitler. ""In mobile homes with a large cockpit, there's also room for an additional monitor.""Older vehicles will require a double DIN radio with a screen, or a new rear-view mirror with an integrated monitor for the rear-view camera.Systems that transmit by wireless are cheap — roughly 100 euros (RM493.35) — but the experts say cable-based systems are better. ""Radio links are susceptible to interference and interference, break-up and frozen images,"" warns Michael Zeitler. This is because the cameras transmit their signals via a frequency that very commonly used in cities.Cable-based cameras with a compatible multimedia input and a monitor cost two to three times more.If the multimedia interface is missing, you'll need to spend more — around 450-600 euros (RM2,220-RM2,960) in Europe — for a special video adapter. An interior mirror with monitor and camera will set you back around 650 euros (RM3,206) in Europe. Labour is not included in those prices.But it's worth it, according to car tester Bernd Volkens from the German motor magazine Auto Bild. ""In contrast to acoustic parking aids — parking beeps — drivers with reversing cameras can see to the centimetre where they can drive to,"" he says. ""It really makes parking stress-free.""Audio warnings, on the other hand, stop the driver at a safety margin of up to 40 centimetres. This means drivers are often wasting space when manoeuvring.In his opinion, the simplest retro-fitting option is a camera at the rear, which transmits via Bluetooth to a smartphone or entertainment system. But here, too, you'll need to keep an eye on the susceptibility to radio interference, and there may also be a delay on the video images.For old vehicles without a double DIN slot, the only solution is a separate, permanently installed additional monitor, says Volkens. ""The camera is simply coupled to the reversing light so that it knows when reverse gear is engaged.""If you know what you are doing, you could fit one yourself in about three hours. But you should be aware that the system can cause problems if the reversing camera diverts power from the reverse light.""Anyone who isn't familiar with vehicle wiring should consult a specialist,"" Volkens says. This brings the added advantage of warranty, should things go wrong with the equipment. – dpa"
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",9:00 AM MYT,Tech,MIKE FREEMAN,"Qualcomm unveils new chips to power smart shopping carts, remote work","Qualcomm has been working for years to get its mobile technology into other products besides smartphones — think drones, laptops and smart security cameras.Those efforts to connect the unconnected — generally called the Internet of Things — have recently started to deliver consequential financial results for Qualcomm, with revenue topping US$1bil (RM4.14bil) in each of the past two quarters.To help keep the momentum going, San Diego's largest publicly traded company rolled out a suite of seven new Internet of Things chips this week. They range from entry-level to premium tier semiconductors.Features include baked-in artificial intelligence and security, power-efficient computing, precise location capabilities and fast Wi-Fi 6, 5G and LTE connectivity, depending on the chip.""Within the Internet of Things ecosystem, there are a variety of segments going through digital transformation, whether its retail or warehouse management or the shipping industry,"" said Nagaraju Naik, Qualcomm senior director of product management.""Collaboration is yet another significant segment. These products that we're introducing are going to enable a lot of those applications.""Qualcomm supplies more than 13,000 Internet of Things customers today. The company expects to add another US$1.3bil (RM4.14bil) in IoT sales in the current quarter.Even so, the bulk of Qualcomm revenue still comes from smartphones — a maturing industry that is consolidating behind a handful of dominant brands such as Samsung and Apple.Samsung already makes its own cellular processors for some of its phones, and Apple is working to design its own cellular chips, too, potentially ditching Qualcomm chips from iPhones.Hence the push to diversify. While the Internet of Things market was growing before Covid-19 lockdowns, the pandemic accelerated adoption, said Naik. Video collaboration led the way with remote work, online school and telehealth appointments.Mobile technology fits right into video collaboration, said Naik. Qualcomm's new top tier Internet of Things chip delivers the processing heft to manage multiple cameras, stream high-resolution video and provide noise-cancelling audio, as well as power artificial intelligence algorithms for things like facial tracking or background blurring.Retail tech is another sector ripe for digital transformation, said Naik. Emerging technologies include smart carts that analyze items, deliver digital coupons and enable just-walk-out shopping.""Smart cart is actually bringing the point-of-sale experience or the checkout experience into the cart,"" said Naik. ""So, you have cameras that can detect what (merchandise) is being picked by the consumer, and then right on the cart you have point-of-sale ability.""Warehouse management and package shipping also are innovating with digital technology, as are smart cities, smart health care and smart factories. As part of the chip rollout, Qualcomm is offering extended hardware and software support for IoT devices for a minimum of eight years.""Qualcomm Technologies is uniquely positioned to lead the IoT ecosystem forward with our systems-level approach,"" said Jeff Lorbeck, senior vice president and general manager of connected smart systems at Qualcomm.""We believe in the power of technology to enrich lives through purposeful innovation with solutions to support the ecosystem in reimagining how the world connects, works and communicates.

The new rules became effective in late May.In a notice dated Thursday, Ghaziabad police wrote to Twitter India head Manish Maheshwari to appear before officials within seven days of the receipt of the summons.""Some people used their Twitter handles to spread hatred and enmity in the society and Twitter did not take cognisance,"" said the notice, which was reviewed by Reuters.""Writings and works which promoted enmity and affected harmony between different communities in the country and the state were encouraged and such anti-society messages were allowed to go viral.""Twitter declined to comment, and Maheshwari did not respond to a request for comment.IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad lashed out at Twitter this week for the Ghaziabad incident, saying its failure to act was ""perplexing.""NO SAFE HARBOURPrasad has said Twitter has not complied with a new set of government rules that required them to appoint new compliance officers by May 26.The rules state that in case of non-compliance, protection that companies enjoy related to any liability against user generated content ""shall not be applicable"" and companies ""shall be liable for punishment under any law.""""The moment Twitter was non-complaint, the safe harbour protection was automatically not available,"" said Shlok Chandra, a New Delhi-based lawyer who represents the federal government in various cases. ""The position is very clear.""Some free speech activists and lawyers, however, disagree.""The Central Government neither has the power to bestow, nor the power to ""withdraw"" the exemption from liability...The determination of the question whether Twitter is entitled to seek exemption from liability is solely within the domain of the Courts,"" Delhi-based Ira Law firm said in a LinkedIn post this month.Three special rapporteurs appointed by a top United Nations human rights body last week urged India to review the new IT rules, saying their broadened scope did not conform with international human rights norms and could threaten digital rights.To comply with India's new IT rules, companies such as Twitter needed to appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal officer and a resident grievance officer. But LinkedIn job postings show all three positions were currently open at Twitter.The social media giant has however retained an interim chief compliance officer, it said this week, adding that it was making all efforts to adhere to the new IT rules.(Reporting by Saurabh Sharma in LUCKNOW and Sankalp Phartiyal in NEW DELHI; Editing by Aditya Kalra, Raju Gopalakrishnan & Simon Cameron-Moore)"

Please be assured that any duplicated transactions will be refunded,” DBS, Singapore’s largest bank, said in a Facebook post.“We apologise for the inconvenience caused and seek your understanding,” it added.Many users said they were unable to log in to their accounts through the app or Internet banking portal.One message said: “We are experiencing heavy traffic to our services. You will be redirected shortly. Alternatively, please log in later.”One of the customers affected by the duplicate deductions is housewife Asyura Irfan.The 37-year-old told The Straits Times that she was charged Sg$11.70 (RM36.13) twice for a transaction made on Grab on Monday, while her husband similarly had Sg$29 (RM89.55) deducted twice from his account for a Giant supermarket purchase on Tuesday. They are both using POSB debit cards.Her mother was also charged Sg$54 (RM166.75) twice for a purchase on booking platform Klook using a POSB debit card, she added. The amount for the purchase on Tuesday was deducted on Thursday, but another deduction was made on Friday for the same purchase.“As of now, I am unable to login to the POSB app,” said Asyura on Friday morning.Several customers said on DBS’ Facebook page that they were also unable to get through to the bank’s customer service hotline.Some asked if the refunds will be automatically credited back to their accounts or if they need to apply for them.Facebook user Leo Nardo Tan urged the bank to investigate the glitch urgently: “I have at least two duplicate transactions that I was aware (of). Need to check through more past transactions.”Brandon Lee, one of those who managed to contact the bank, wrote: “The customer officer told me to request for a callback once they find out the cause in three working days.”The Straits Times has contacted DBS for more information on the glitch. – The Straits Times (Singapore)/Asia News Network"
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",2:30 PM MYT,Tech,,China orders billionaire to lie low after poem post sparks fury,"China’s government summoned Meituan’s Wang Xing to a meeting recently and warned him to keep a low profile, after the founder of China’s third-largest tech corporation last month posted a controversial poem that convulsed markets and sparked a social media furor.Beijing officials called Wang in after the food delivery mogul posted a millennium-old poem regarded by many as implicit criticism of the government, according to people with knowledge of the matter. They warned him to refrain from courting the spotlight, at least temporarily, the people said, asking not to be identified as they weren’t authorised to discuss the matter.The Tang Dynasty poem – describing the burning of books under China’s first emperor – was widely seen as anti-establishment and triggered a US$26bil (RM107.75bil) selloff in Meituan’s shares over two days. While the CEO later issued a clarification saying his post had been targeted at the short-sightedness of his own industry, some investors drew parallels to the criticisms issued by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd founder Jack Ma against regulators last year, which triggered an unprecedented crackdown on China’s Internet sector. The officials however indicated to Wang that no further fallout will result from the incident, the people said.Meituan didn’t respond to a written request for comment. Like Alibaba previously, Meituan is grappling with a probe by the state antitrust watchdog into alleged monopolistic behaviour such as merchant exclusivity, which some analysts have estimated could result in fines of over US$700mil (RM2.90bil).Officials refrained from taking more severe action against Wang because they didn’t want to convey the impression that every minor transgression could result in dire consequences, one of the people said. The incident transpired less than two months before the Chinese Communist Party is poised to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding on July 1, a politically sensitive period in the country.The entrepreneur has since stayed under the radar. Since Wang posted the statement clarifying his intentions on May 9, he’s abruptly stopped posting to his account on Fanfou, the social media platform he created before Meituan. Prior to the controversy, he updated his account at least several times a week.The billionaire hasn’t been seen nor heard in public beyond a brief appearance on Meituan’s quarterly earnings call in May. His donation of a US$2.3bil (RM9.53bil) stake in the food delivery giant to charity – one of the largest single acts of philanthropy during the pandemic – was revealed through a company disclosure statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, in lieu of a personal announcement.Beijing is now focusing its efforts on a broader investigation, announced in April, into whether Meituan violated anti-monopoly laws through practices such as forced exclusivity arrangements. Meituan executives said last month it’s set up a dedicated team to work with officials conducting the probe, and vowed strict compliance with new guidelines.Wang’s fate contrasts with that of Alibaba’s Ma, whose business empire came under sustained assault from regulators. His fintech giant Ant Group Co was forced to scrap what would have been a record initial public offering, while Alibaba was slapped with a US$2.8bil (RM11.60bil) fine for antitrust violations, the largest such penalty ever.Ma is also under pressure to divest some of his media holdings, people familiar with the matter have said, and the flamboyant businessman hasn’t been seen in public beyond a handful of low-key appearances. – Bloomberg"

Now, its artificial intelligence-powered namesake is having some glitches of its own.A sleek robotic trimaran retracing the 1620 journey of the famous English vessel had to turn back on June 18 to fix a mechanical problem.Nonprofit marine research organisation ProMare, which worked with IBM to build the autonomous ship, said it made the decision to return to base “to investigate and fix a minor mechanical issue” but hopes to be back on the trans-Atlantic journey as soon as possible.With no humans on board the ship, there’s no one to make repairs while it’s at sea.Piloted by artificial intelligence technology, the 50-foot (15-meter) Mayflower Autonomous Ship began its trip early Tuesday, departing from Plymouth, England, and spending some time off the Isles of Scilly before it headed for deeper waters.It was supposed to take up to three weeks to reach Provincetown on Cape Cod before making its way to Plymouth, Massachusetts. If successful, it would be the largest autonomous vessel to cross the Atlantic.There is some historical precedent for the malfunction: The original Mayflower that carried Pilgrim settlers to New England was supposed to set sail in the summer of 1620 but twice turned back to England because of a leaking problem affecting its sister ship, the Speedwell. – AP"

We will share additional information as it becomes available,” an Akamai spokesperson said.A series of high-profile hack-for-ransom attacks have also left corporations around the world jittery over cybersecurity risks, although there was no indication the latest problems were caused by malicious actors.Colonial Pipeline was briefly shuttered after an attack in May, and JBS, the world’s largest meat producer, was forced to stop operations in the United States and Australia.Both firms reportedly paid ransoms to get operations back up and running.The issue of cybersecurity was at the top of the agenda when US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin met in Geneva on Wednesday.Washington believes hackers who have extorted hundreds of millions of dollars from Western governments, companies, and organisations operate from Russian soil. – AFP"

US-led negotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear programme have been stalled since 2019.A Kaeri official said the institute reported the intrusion to the government after discovering it on May 31, and an investigation was being carried out.An official at the science and technology ministry, which is leading the investigation, said it had not found evidence to determine that North Korea was behind the hack.Simon Choi, head of IssueMakersLab, said Kimsuky had long been seeking access to South Korean government and legislative agencies and educational institutes.“We’ve been tracing their activity and such attempts happen on a daily basis,” Choi told Reuters.“But this case caught our attention given the sensitivity of the think tank’s work.”South Korea has accused the North of a string of cyberattacks, including on multiple banks in 2011, a state-run nuclear reactor operator in 2015 and the defence ministry in 2016.In November, South Korean lawmakers said the intelligence agency had foiled North Korean attempts to hack into companies developing coronavirus vaccines. – Reuters"
"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",6:35 PM MYT,Tech,JONATHAN WOSEN,Can AI predict how sick you’ll get from Covid-19? Scientists think so,"SAN DIEGO, California: A team of San Diego scientists is harnessing artificial intelligence to understand why Covid-19 symptoms can vary dramatically from one person to the next – information that could prove useful in the continued fight against the coronavirus and future pandemics.Researchers pored through publicly available data to see how other viruses alter which genes our cells turn on or off. Using that information, they found a set of genes activated across a wide range of infections, including the novel coronavirus. Those genes predicted whether someone would have a mild or a severe case of Covid-19, and whether they were likely to have a lengthy hospital stay.A University of California, San Diego-led team joined by researchers at Scripps Research and the La Jolla Institute for Immunology published the findings June 11. The study’s authors say their approach could help determine whether new treatments and vaccines are working.“When the whole world faced this pandemic, it took several months for people to scramble” to understand the new virus, said Dr Pradipta Ghosh, a UC San Diego cell biologist and one of the study’s authors. “I think we need more of this computational framework to guide us in panic states like this.”The project began in March 2020, when Ghosh teamed up with UC San Diego computer scientist Debashis Sahoo to better understand why the novel coronavirus was causing little to no symptoms in some people while wreaking havoc on others.There was just one problem: The novel coronavirus was, well, novel, meaning there wasn’t much data to learn from.So Sahoo and Ghosh took a different tack. They went to public databases and downloaded 45,000 samples from a wide array of viral infections, including Ebola, Zika, influenza, HIV, and hepatitis C virus, among others.Their hope was to find a shared response pattern to these viruses, and that’s exactly what they saw: 166 genes that were consistently cranked up during infection. Among that list, 20 genes generally separated patients with mild symptoms from those who became severely ill.The coronavirus was no exception. Sahoo and Ghosh say they identified this common viral response pattern well before testing it in samples from Covid-19 patients and infected cells, yet the results held up surprisingly well.“It seemed to work in every data set we used,” Sahoo said. “It was hard to believe.”They say their findings show that respiratory failure in Covid-19 patients is the result of overwhelming inflammation that damages the airways and, over time, makes immune cells less effective.Stanford’s Purvesh Khatri isn’t surprised. His lab routinely uses computer algorithms and statistics to find patterns in large sets of immune response data. In 2015, Khatri’s group found that respiratory viruses trigger a common response. And in April, they reported that this shared response applied to a range of other viruses, too, including the novel coronavirus.That makes sense, Khatri says, because researchers have long known there are certain genes the immune system turns on in response to virtually any viral infection.“Overall, the idea is pretty solid,” said Khatri of the recent UC San Diego-led study. “The genes are all (the) usual suspects.”Sahoo and Ghosh continue to test their findings in new coronavirus data as it becomes available. They’re particularly interested in Covid-19 long-haulers. Ghosh says they’re already seeing that people with prolonged coronavirus symptoms have distinct gene activation patterns compared to those who have fully recovered. Think of it like a smoldering fire that won’t die out.The researchers’ ultimate hope isn’t just to predict and understand severe disease, but to stop it. For example, they say, a doctor could give a patient a different therapy if a blood sample suggests they’re likely to get sicker with their current treatment. Ghosh adds that the gene pattern they’re seeing could help identify promising new treatments and vaccines against future pandemics based on which therapies prevent responses linked to severe disease.“In unknown, uncharted territory, this provides... guard rails for us to start looking around, understand (the virus), find solutions, build better models and, finally, find therapeutics.” – The San Diego Union-Tribune/Tribune News Service"
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",7:00 AM MYT,Tech,PHILIPP SCHULTE,"Just joined Twitter? Stay focussed, encourage debate and other tips","Twitter is now 15-years-old and claims 199 million users worldwide. That's not a lot compared to social media behemoths like Facebook which claims over 2 billion users.However, if you want to have a say in trending topics, Twitter is the place to be. Social media advisor Barbara Ward says Twitter is particularly suitable for people interested in specific topics.“Twitter works across niches and subject areas. Using hashtags and search words, you quickly end up in a bubble that corresponds to your own interests. Once you get there, you will be provided with news and new information very quickly,"" Ward says.Matthias C. Kettemann from the Leibniz Institute for Media Research in Hamburg, Germany says that Twitter has become a serious platform for science and politics.""For me, Twitter is a very good tool to make scientific contacts all over the world and to keep in touch with my scientific community. If there is an exciting verdict in the USA, it will be commented on on Twitter,"" he says.Compared to other networks, a Twitter profile is quick to set up. All you need are your name, email address, and a unique user name (your Twitter handle).You can also write something about yourself in up to 160 characters. This short biography is a tremendous help in gaining new followers, Ward says.It's important to outline who you are and what you're doing on Twitter. ""The best way to do this is to concentrate on a few key terms that define your own subject areas and interests,"" Ward says.But that alone is not enough to get attention, followers, and likes. To achieve that, you need to tweet high-quality, focussed content.Social media expert Ward says that commonplace, banal statements quickly disappear on Twitter and so getting an impact is all about posting content that can be discussed and debated.Commenting on, liking, and retweeting other people's tweets is also an important part of being effective on Twitter. The platform has other features that users should know about. One is the ability to create lists to which Twitter accounts can be assigned.“This is an excellent way to sort your own news feed,” says Ward. With the lists you can have many small, thematically sorted feeds instead of one overflowing newsfeed.And then of course there's the all-important hashtag. However, you shouldn't overdo their use. ""Studies say that tweets with more than two or three hashtags get even less attention"" rather than more, Ward says.For that reason, hashtags should only be used in a targeted manner, for example when tweeting from an event or when the hashtag adds some important context to the tweet.""The Twitter community is fundamentally less playful, but more focussed on news and information,"" according to Ward.She believes the new Twitter format Spaces, an imitation of the social audio app Clubhouse, will become important in the long term. Here, users can have live audio conversations in groups, just like in a moderated conference call. – dpa"

But throughout this project, they were encouraged to listen, speak, read and write in the language,” said the teacher at SK St. Patrick, Tawau, Sabah.The international research-based collaborative project is the brainchild of Pramod Thube, an English language teacher from Maharashtra, India.It aims to instil compassion in the student fraternity and encourage everyone to explore ways to attain and spread happiness in these unusual times."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,News,SANDHYA MENON,Saving our healthcare system,"WITH the number of Covid-19 cases still at a high, healthcare workers are overworked and burnt out.The healthcare system, is already at breaking point and Intensive Care Units (ICU) nationwide are almost full, with several of them operating over capacity, Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah warned on May 22.As the number of new cases approached 8,000 a day, he posted photos of exhausted medical frontliners – some drenched in sweat and others lying down, too tired to even take off their face masks or personal protective equipment – on his social media.To address the situation, housemen, fresh medical graduates as well as retired medical practitioners would be enlisted to help at vaccination centres, said Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba.On June 10, he said manpower would be increased by roping in housemen, who are doing their sixth stint, to administer vaccines or to monitor those who have just been vaccinated. Those who recently graduated from medical schools such as doctors, nurses and dentists, Dr Adham added, would be sent for training and issued a licence to practise before being mobilised at vaccination centres.While the move will no doubt ease the manpower shortage at vaccination centres, frontliners at government clinics and hospitals, and district health offices, are still in dire need of help.Calling on the Health Ministry to re-strategise, the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) said many frontliners are struggling to cope with the surge in Covid-19 cases.Stressing that the country cannot afford to wait for the situation to worsen, its president Prof Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said immediate steps are needed to ease the burden of medical frontliners.“The ministry should rope in housemen who are awaiting their posting, medical students, nursing students and also medical assistants with basic medical knowledge and training, to help on the ground with contact tracing.“District health officers are tasked with the daily Covid-19 management duties of triaging, screening, assessing, contact tracing, monitoring and home monitoring of Category 1 and 2 Covid-19 patients.“Apart from this, they also manage acute and chronic non-Covid-19 cases on a daily basis.“These officers feel like they are pulled in every direction and with the surge in cases, the system is on the verge of collapse.“The ministry must take a serious view of the situation and urgently address these manpower shortages, especially in the Klang Valley where cases are the highest,” Dr Subramaniam said in a statement last month.MORE STORIES ON PAGE 5"

It would also enable us to carry out our duties more effectively once we start serving in hospitals.By allowing us to help now, we will learn how to work in the wards, get used to the system from the get-go and accustom ourselves to the workload of a house officer.I would be more than happy to start work in the wards immediately if given a chance to help in this pandemic.” - John Chai, 26“LOOKING at the Covid-19 situation in our country and around the world, we cannot ignore the fact that things are not rosy.The Health Ministry needs all the manpower it can get to manage the situation and what better way to do so than to rope in final year medical students and housemen? We are going to enter the medical field eventually so why not let us do so sooner?Our experience and skills will be enhanced and we can get a birds eye view on what to expect when we eventually start work at the hospitals.There may be concerns about us being exposed to the virus but we were already prepared for hazards like these the day we signed up for medical school.I think it’s good for housemen, final year medical students and trainee nurses to be included in the battle against Covid-19. Not only will we be better equipped when we go for our posting, but we can help lessen the heavy burden of our healthcare workers.”- A.Kumar, 25"

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,News,ROWENA CHUA,‘Green World’ vehicle gets global nod,"FOLLOWING in their seniors’ footsteps, a team of five students from Multimedia University (MMU) in Melaka recently scored a major highlight in their engineering endeavour.Team Grüne Welt, or “Green World” in German, came in second in the Vehicle Design Award (Prototype) category at this year’s Shell Eco-marathon Virtual Off-Track Awards for Asia and the Middle East.They were the only Malaysian team to have gained recognition at the competition, which saw a record number of 198 entries from 64 teams across 11 countries. It was nearly twice the number of submissions from previous years.The team – comprising mechanical engineering students Ng Kean Pin, Tan Jun Liang, Liou Jun Quan and Leow Tze Yi, and information technology student Ngwe Jia Le – bagged the prize of US$750 (RM3,108).In an email interview with StarEdu, the team expressed their joy over their win.“We had aimed for the Vehicle Design Award for some time, and we finally achieved it this year. Our hard work paid off,” they said in a collective statement.They added that they had been spurred on by their seniors’ “outstanding result” at Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2019 where they emerged top in Malaysia and sixth in Asia, besides bagging the Circular Economy Award.The 2021 winning team let on that they opted to compete in the Vehicle Design Award category as they were confident of their Eco-V7 battery-electric prototype vehicle fulfilling all the requirements.“It has a minimum aerodynamic drag, inspired by the shape of a shark’s profile. This reduces the wastage of battery energy while the vehicle is in motion on the track, thus making it energy-efficient.“Not just that, its drivetrain and shell-chassis connections are all in modular design, which eases the assembly and maintenance process, as the parts can be assembled and dismantled easily,” they said, adding that lightweight carbon fibre reinforced structures and a direct steering system are used to minimise the vehicle’s weight. Driven by the organisers’ nod to their prototype, the team has stepped up their vehicle fabrication process, although their effort has been met with interruptions due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Despite the hindrances, we are determined to complete the fabrication of Eco-V7 by the end of this year,” they said.The team did not forget to express their gratitude for their advisors Lim Boon Kian and Liew Kia Wai – both senior lecturers at MMU’s Faculty of Engineering and Technology who have been their pillars of support throughout their contest journey.“Fabricating and assembling Eco-V7 is not an easy task. We often encounter unexpected problems, such as mismatch of carbon fibre rod connections and misalignment of wheels,” they said, adding that they have also sought guidance from their seniors who have first-hand experience in fabricating earlier MMU Grüne Welt Eco series vehicles.When asked how they will use the cash prize, the team said they have agreed to save it for their future vehicle development and fabrication.Through their win, the team has also acquired 100 Virtual League points, propelling their ranking to 10th in the Asia Pacific region and 30th globally.The global Virtual League is the latest feature of the Shell Eco-marathon Virtual Programme, enabling teams to accrue points across a range of challenges, including the Off-Track Awards and a brand-new Autonomous Programming Competition, which all feed into an ongoing league table.In a press release, Shell Eco-marathon global general manager Norman Koch said the 2021 virtual programme is designed to recognise and reward the students’ achievements throughout the year.“From Virtual Technical Inspection to Off-Track Awards and global energy challenges like Pitch the Future, it aims to stretch and strengthen their science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills from start to finish,” he said.“While nothing can replace the excitement on the track, we hope that these virtual components will continue to provide opportunities to Shell Eco-marathon teams as we navigate these difficult times,” he added.Team Grüne Welt shared that they are actively taking part in all the virtual events held by Shell Eco-marathon.“We are in the midst of preparing for the Road to 2050 Bonus Challenge. We hope to win awards in both the Virtual Technical Inspection and the Road to 2050 competitions,” they said.Shell Eco-marathon is one of the world’s leading student engineering competitions. Over the past 35 years, the programme has brought together STEM students from across the globe to design and build energy-efficient vehicles, with the aim of shaping a lower carbon future for all."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,News,,Urban farming for adequate food supply,"A GROUP of students have designed an urban farming system to encourage more people to plant their own produce.The team of 30 are first year degree students at the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Built Environment in Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM).They came up with the idea for their ongoing semester project, which is part of their Architecture Studio course, said a UTHM press release on May 2.To complete the project, they worked together with the Batu Pahat Agriculture Department, the Batu Pahat Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (Fama), and Suria Bistari Agrotech Enterprise.According to project head Nadiyah Noor Hisham, the urban farming system comprises five modules and uses wood as its main building material.“The aquaponic system module uses water from catfish farming as fertiliser that reaches the plants through the crop funnels,” she explained, adding that chicken droppings from the poultry farming system module can also be used as fertiliser.The entire process from concept to completion took four weeks, said Nadiyah.It is hoped that the urban farming system will be able to complement existing systems, which can be quite costly.Nadiyah added that the system can benefit housewives and urban dwellers by reducing the amount spent on purchasing food, as well as ensuring there is adequate food supply in the community.Batu Pahat Agriculture Department representative Kamaruzzaman Abd Salam said the system has the potential to be commercialised after some improvements have been made."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,News,SANDHYA MENON,"MMA: Let housemen, medical students join Covid-19 fight","THERE is no time to waste in a crisis.Urging the Health Ministry to pull out all the stops to help the nation’s frontliners fight the pandemic, the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) has suggested that some 1,000 of the nation’s medical graduates still waiting for their postings be mobilised together with medical and nursing students, as well as medical assistants, with basic medical knowledge and training to help on the ground with contact tracing as soon as possible.Worried that the country’s healthcare system will crumble under the weight of the high number of Covid-19 cases, MMA president Prof Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said all available hands need to be on deck as there is an acute shortage of manpower at the district health departments and government clinics.“At a time when cases are at an all-time high, we must look at every possible avenue to enhance our healthcare system and support our medical frontliners,” he said.Speaking to StarEdu, he said there are at least more than 1,000 medical graduates waiting to be absorbed into the medical system.Last March, Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba said the ministry would place housemen in public hospitals nationwide to support medical staff, in particular doctors, who have their hands full due to Covid-19.“These housemen will help ease the burden faced by doctors and specialists that focus on Covid-19, and they will also help make hospital operations run smoother.“The housemen, however, will also have to go through an induction course for five days, that includes the handling of Covid-19 elements,” he said.Final year medical students and housemen awaiting their postings, Dr Subramaniam said, can also work in non-Covid wards.This, he said, could be a win-win situation for all parties involved as it allows students to familiarise themselves with ward work, and saves time in training them in the future.“Houseman would not have to wait any longer for their placements, and with these two groups helping out in non-Covid wards, more doctors can work in the Covid wards, thus relieving their overworked colleagues.”Bringing housemen-in-waiting and students onboard, he added, would provide them with invaluable practical training.“They will, however, need to be vaccinated and there must be collaboration with the Higher Education Ministry before this can happen.“Final year medical students could assist doctors in non-Covid wards to familiarise themselves with daily hospital duties before starting housemanship,” he said, adding that medical students who have yet to be registered with the Malaysian Medical Council because of technical issues should also be asked to help out.The ministry, he said, could develop a training pathway for house officers where there is a separate unit formed for final year students to register for housemanship and be interviewed right after completing their degrees.To save on administrattive costs, these student should also be allowed to request for placements to speed up the housemanship process, he said. Consider thisThe advantages of roping in these groups, Dr Subramaniam said, are multifold.It prepares medical students for their housemanship training and can be part of their practical training, he said.“Additionally, medical graduates waiting for their posting won’t lose touch with their practical skills and while waiting, this could also serve as good revision time for them.“The idea of being a doctor includes helping people.“The chance to assist in a pandemic may never come by again. Experiences you take away from a situation like this will make you a better doctor,” he said.While some junior doctors may be overwhelmed by the long working hours and sacrifices the job entails, roping them in now can make it easier for them to adjust to the Malaysian hospital system before their housemanship posting.Dr Subramaniam, however, acknowledged that proper planning and great care is needed before students can be brought in to help in real world settings.Medicolegal, insurance, remuneration and administrative issues, which may entail additional paperwork and costs, must be thoroughly studied, he said.“Students must also be well trained, assessed and supervised to avoid any mishaps or casualties,” he said.Former MMA and the Medico-Legal Society of Malaysia president Prof Datuk Dr N.K.S. Tharmaseelan said since the Covid-19 outbreak, many have stepped up to help.A group known as the MMA Volunteer Corps, he said, sent a list of 30 senior and experienced general practitioners, retired specialists and government doctors to the ministry to volunteer their expertise and to assist the frontliners.Doctors who have been waiting for their postings for months should be quickly recruited to begin their service to the nation, he added.“There are also many housemen who, after their two years of housemanship, have had their services terminated for unexplained reasons.“These housemen could have been retained and had their services extended,” he said.But fast tracking final year medical students to become doctors by enlisting them to help the frontliners, is not something Dr Tharmaseelan, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Melaka-Manipal Medical College, is in favour of.“They have their training schedules, examinations and various other postings to consider. Covid-19 is not the only disease they need to know about.“There are numerous different cases to learn about and to treat,” he said, adding that the pandemic has placed many constraints on training and teaching.Enlisting “raw manpower” such as students, to fight Covid-19 will not ease the country’s healthcare burden nor will it be useful for the students themselves in the long run as their training would have been compromised, he added.“These students would have missed their online classes and clinical training because of the pandemic.“They still have so much to learn. Sending them out now would hinder their already compromised training.“The experienced ones are aplenty so why enlist students? We must ensure that they graduate as fully qualified doctors, not as half-baked professionals,” he said.Medical Practitioners Coalition Association of Malaysia president Dr Raj Kumar Maharajah said doctors who have graduated and are waiting for their posting should be the first ones to be absorbed into the system to assist in the non-Covid wards and patients. “There are many waiting to start work. Final year medical students need to concentrate on their final exams.“There is no hurry to absorb them into the system as they may pose a danger not only to themselves but also to the patients.“At a time when we are looking to curb the virus spread, it’s best not to have too many people walking around the hospital,” he said.Dr Raj Kumar explained that to be legally able to treat and help out in the wards, these students first need to be registered with the Malaysian Medical Council as full fledged doctors.Final year students should be asked to help only if hospitals are really shorthanded and are facing an emergency, he opined.“We have not reached that stage yet. We can revisit this idea when the time comes, if it does,” he said."

"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,Opinion,PHILIP GOLINGAI,Furious politicking over reconvening Parliament,"WHICH is the key word in the phrase “as soon as possible”? Is it “soon” or “possible”?On Wednesday, after a special meeting of the Malay Rulers at Istana Negara to discuss efforts to combat Covid-19, the King called for Parliament to be reconvened “as soon as possible”.For the Opposition – and Umno leaders who aren’t fans of Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin’s Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia – the key is “soon”. For example, the Pakatan Harapan presidential council stated that Muhyiddin should not prolong the suspension of Parliament any longer.On the other hand, the Perikatan Nasional coalition government is focusing on “possible”. Soon is not possible because of the Covid-19 numbers. A day before the special meeting, Muhyiddin outlined that Parliament would open once the Covid-19 situation improves in September or October.For Prof James Chin, from the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania, Australia, the statement “as soon as possible” simply means ASAP.“The King has previously said that regardless of the state of emergency, Parliament can convene. All the MPs have been vaccinated, there is no reason they can’t push for Parliament to be opened ASAP,” he said.For Universiti Utara Malaysia political lecturer Prof Dr Mohd Azizuddin Mohd Sani, the key word is also “possible”. He said “as soon as possible” is possibly linked to the number of Malaysians vaccinated.“We are targeting 80%, but by the end of the year, the highest we can reach is 60%. We need to cater to the issue of vaccination. If there is an election – for example, the Sarawak election – and if vaccination is not an issue, then the election can be held soon,” he said.“When Parliament is open, we will know how many MPs support the government and the Opposition respectively. If Umno decides not to support Perikatan, we might have to get ready for a general election.”(The Sarawak State Legislative Assembly expired on June 6, but it will continue until Aug 1 due to the Emergency. If the Emergency is lifted, the state election must be called within 60 days. Four by-elections are also on hold because of the Emergency.)Universiti Malaya political analyst Dr Muhammad Asri Mohd Ali says that the phrase is not a titah (order).“The executive will decide when is the appropriate time. They are not bound. Let’s say ‘soon’ is two or three months from now since it was the advice or opinion of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong,” he said.“Politicians, especially the Opposition, will say anything to take advantage of recent event. It’s normal.”So how soon will Parliament reconvene?Prof Chin said there are many rumours circulating that it will happen on Aug 2: “That is funny as there’s no guarantee. It depends on the Covid-19 situation in July. If it gets worse and there’s no clear recovery, I suspect things will not be as smooth as the Opposition thinks.“It is the government’s decision, whether they want to have a sitting right now or not. And if they want to delay, they can wait until the end of the state of emergency.”Prof Mohd Azizuddin of Univer-siti Utara Malaysia concurred that it is up to the Perikatan government to decide on a date: “If they want to delay it, they can until the end of the Emergency,” he said.He pointed out that the Oppo-sition has gone on the offensive by saying that the government must listen to the Royal Council and reconvene the august house soon. But the Royal Council doesn’t want to be seen as intervening in politics, he said.Universiti Malaya’s Muhammad Asri argued that it is up to the executive branch of government led by the Prime Minister to decide when is the appropriate time for Parliament to call for a meeting.On Wednesday, the Malay Rulers stated that there is no need to keep the country under a state of emergency beyond Aug 1. I asked the three political analysts if they think the Emergency will be lifted on that date.Prof Mohd Azizuddin believes it will end then: “The Royal Council clearly mentions it.”Muhammad Asri agrees: “Even though we said the Rulers issued only their opinion on this matter, the executive will agree with it to show their respect for our monarchy,” he said.“For the Sarawak state election, since the state government’s duration ended early this month, maybe the executive will ask for an Emergency at the state level. Otherwise, Sarawak must hold state elections in the midst of the Covid-19 situation,” he said.Prof Chin thinks otherwise. He said the government will probably only decide on lifting the Emergency in the middle of July based on the Covid-19 numbers. If infections and deaths are high at that time, it might have no choice but to ask for the Emergency to be extended, he said.“Obviously, without the restrictions, you cannot control Covid-19. You cannot vaccinate your way out of this situation because even if you look at the government’s timeline, you can only get herd immunity at the end of the year,” he said.But Prof Chin also pointed out that the government could impose the same restrictions without using the word “Emergency” – “So even without the state of emergency, all the restrictions will be in place,” he said.The possibility of opening Parlia-ment as soon as possible and lifting the Emergency on Aug 1 have turned up the political heat – which is the opposite of what the Rulers desired, I’m sure. Politicians are back to counting the numbers of MPs they have or could have in support as they speculate about a new government.Prof Mohd Azizuddin said we’ll know how stable Perikatan is when Parliament reopens.Prof Chin noted that while some people are excited about a change of government, he doesn’t think it’s that simple.“If we are talking about a backdoor coup, yes, that’s always possible. But if we talk about a coup through Parliament, I doubt it.Not in the present circumstances,” he said.On whether the Perikatan government would survive when Parliament reconvenes, Muham-mad Asri said it depends on several factors. Like the strength of the Perikatan coalition, to begin with.“If they are still intact, and Barisan Nasional or any other component party still supports them, then they will survive,” he said.It also depends on how far Perikatan can push Parliamentary procedure: “If they can stop a vote of confidence from being held, then they will survive,” he said.The third factor is the approval of the budget in October: “If the Opposition behaved like it did last October when some of them approved the budget and only Tun M (Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad) and few others rejected it, then the status quo will remain,” he said.“The key players that can pose a threat to the Perikatan government are the Barisan Nasional members of Parliament. Some of them like (Gua Musang MP) Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, (Padang Rengas MP) Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz and a few others have been openly against the government.”Muhammad Asri added that Muhyiddin and the Perikatan government will use every bit of power at their disposal to make sure they have enough support in Parliament.“We already saw this when some PKR MPs from Sarawak crossed the floor at the end of last year,” he said.There’s too much politicking in the country, with some wanting to be PM or in power as soon as possible. But the big concern for the rakyat is that the Covid-19 pandemic will be controlled as soon as possible."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",11:41 AM MYT,Opinion,DR GEORGE LEE,Wishing for a father's role on Fathers' Day,"Dear Dr G,I am a 30-year-old man who has been married for more than two years.My wife and I have always dreamt of having kids to complete our family.We have both tried very hard and have regular sex in the hope she will get pregnant.Sadly, there has been no success despite regular intercourse over the last two years.My wife went for a check-up with the gynaecologist and was given the all-clear.When I went for my fertility tests, I found out I had been ""firing blanks"" all along.My sex life, by all accounts, is normal and I have libido, erection and ejaculation.Apparently, I have azoospermia, a medical condition where there is no sperm in my semen.How is it possible that I ejaculate normally but there is no sperm in it?What exactly is azoospermia and why is it affecting me?Lastly, the doctor suggested that I undergo a small operation where they will retrieve sperm from my testes for test tube babies. Is that necessary?I really hope to celebrate Fathers' Days in the future – so is my hope for fatherhood dashed for good?RegardsBlank BenjaminAzoospermia is a medical condition where a man has normal sexual function and ejaculation but his semen contains no sperm. The obvious but undesirable outcome is male-factor infertility.Azoospermia affects up to 1% of the male population, but prevalence can be as high as 20% when investigating the cause of infertility in couples.Although a diagnosis of azoospermia sounds devastating, many forms of the condition are amenable to medical treatment to restore fertility.Under normal circumstances, sperm are formed and mature in the testicles, which travel through the reproductive tract to the prostate. The sperm will mix with seminal and prostatic secretions that make up semen. With or without sperm, the secretion forms a viscous, white fluid that comes out of the penis.Men can continue to ejaculate normally, oblivious to the fact they are ""firing blanks"" until a semen analysis is carried out.Azoospermia is generally classified as obstructive and non-obstructive in origin. The two different types can further be sub-classified into congenital and acquired azoospermia.Obstructive azoospermia constitutes 40% of azoospermia due to defect of the vas deferens or epididymis resulting in occlusion of the passage of sperms from the testicles. The common reason for such physical obstruction is vasectomy, when the intended intervention for contraception causes men to fire blanks. Other forms of acquired obstructive azoospermia may include testicular trauma and infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea causing the scarring of the vas.Genetic mutations are also known to result in obstructive azoospermia. Men who have cystic fibrosis or carry such genetic mutation may have a defective connection of the vas causing congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens. Other inborn deformities such as congenital prostatic cysts are also well-recognised rendering sperm passage obstruction.The non-obstructive form of azoospermia can be caused by defective testicles with the inability to produce or allow the maturation of sperm. This can be due to undescended testicles or spermatogenic arrest. Other acquired destruction of spermatogenesis includes childhood mumps, cancer, diabetes, varicocele and radiation that destroy normal sperm production, causing azoospermia.The most basic way to diagnose azoospermia is through semen analysis. Blood investigations and the biopsy of the testicles can also assist a definitive diagnosis of obstructive or non-obstructive azoospermia. It can also identify the presence of sperm that can be potentially used to fertilise embryos.A biopsy and extraction of sperm are usually done concurrently. Samples are retrieved using a small needle to harvest sperm directly from the scrotum. In addition, a small procedure to explore the reproductive tracts with the assistance of a microscope can also have the added benefit of getting healthy sperm for the purpose of IVF and test-tube babies.For many men, a diagnosis of azoospermia can be a blow to a dream of fatherhood. In the last few decades, however, advancements in research for male infertility and refinement of sperm retrieval have contributed so much to the art of ART (artificial reproductive technology) that the obstacles of azoospermia can be overcome.The 16th-century Italian philosopher, astronomer and mathematician Giordano Bruno once said ""time is the father of truth"".Dr G when put on the spot says ""time is of absolute essence to discover the father of truth"" as early intervention to give nature a helping hand! On that note, I wish Ben a smooth journey and all fathers out there a Happy Fathers' Day!"
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",2:15 PM MYT,Opinion,JOCELINE TAN,New round of political instability lies ahead,"A week is a long time in politics and what a long and tumultuous one it has been for Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin (pic).The outcome of the Malay Rulers meeting has, rightly or wrongly, come across as a sort of royal reprimand of his Cabinet. The opposition leaders are calling for his resignation and he is staring at what might be an epic showdown of numbers in Parliament very soon.Everything seems to point to another round of political instability for the country.If there is anything good to be said about the unpopular Emergency Ordinance, it is that the restrictive order brought down the political temperature.However, the mercury is rising again and from most accounts, Muhyiddin is preparing to bite the bullet and face his opponents in Parliament.He took over the premiership on a controversial note but with a high approval rating. But he is now at the most vulnerable point in his premiership largely as a result of the government’s handling of the pandemic.So is his job on the line?If he fails to muster the numbers against an ambitious opposition bench that has rallied behind their prime minister candidate Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, then yes, his ruling coalition will be in trouble.However, it is untrue that the Malay Rulers want Muhyiddin out. That conclusion was drawn from the Sultans’ emphasis on the need for a stable government that enjoys the confidence of the rakyat.Palace sources said that people have either over-read the statement or chose to read it it they way they want things to go.The Yang di-Pertuan Agong and his brother Rulers - said the source - are concerned about the pandemic and its effects on the economy and people’s livelihood.Like everyone else, they think the government could have done better in managing the pandemic and that the political leadership could do more to regain the people’s confidence.The royals are said to live in a gilded cage but social media has enabled them to tune in to what people are saying about issues, about their political leaders and even about the royals themselves.The Rulers believe they need to be proactive to voice their concerns.They are aware that certain segments of society think they have over-stepped their role as a constitutional monarchy but these are unusual times, and unusual times call for unusual measures.“Personally, I think it’s alright for the King to engage the stakeholders. Tuanku Agong did not want to leave anyone out as we prepare to the end the Emergency,” said former Kapar Umno division chief Datuk Faizal Abdullah.The Rulers spoke as one voice at their Tuesday meeting although the Sultan of Johor’s motorcade leaving early had sparked speculation.The Johor sovereign had flown over in his own jet but left before the meeting was over. He apparently had to be back at the Senai Airport which closes early as a result of the emergency. He had in fact arrived early to join the King for lunch.There were also reports that the Yang Di Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan was not among those arriving in the afternoon but he arrived on the dot at 3pm after getting his swab test result, a requisite for all attendees.Putrajaya acknowledged the outcome of the Rulers’ meeting with a brief and terse statement that one political observer equated to an “OK, noted with thanks”.Everyone can see that ties between Putrajaya and the Palace are not exactly all sunshine and everything nice at the moment.The Palace statement was couched in royal nomenclature but it is clear that the royals want Parliament to convene and for the emergency to end after Aug 1.There appears to be some sort of tug-of-war over when Parliament should meet. Putrajaya was looking at a September date whereas the Rulers want it as soon as possible.A standoff would not be good, it would be seen as challenging the Palace.As it is, police reports have been lodged against de-facto Law Minister Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan for insisting that Parliament will meet in September, in line with what the Prime Minister said when unveiling the national recovery plan on Tuesday.Whether Parliament meets sooner or later, the coming sitting is set to be the mother of all sittings.Pakatan leaders are elated, they feel they are a step closer to returning to Putrajaya and Opposition Leader Anwar is once against within sight of the premiership.“It’s the most positive development for us since the Sheraton Move. After meeting the political leaders, the King can see people are not happy with the current government,” said a PKR parliamentarian.Ideas like a minority government and even something entirely new like a unity government are being tossed about ahead of Parliament convening.“I don’t want to spoil the mood but we should not discount the possibility that if pushed to the wall, if the situation gets too chaotic, Muhyiddin may decide to advise the King to dissolve Parliament,” said Umno supreme council member Datuk Seri Johari Ghani.The Prime Minister does not have to name the election date straight away.“Under the constitution, he has 60 days to decide on the date of election. In the meantime, he can push on with the vaccination to bring down the infection numbers,” said Johari.Muhyiddin’s numbers will probably be tested during the voting of bills like what happened during the Budget session last year.It is not just a question of whether Muhyiddin has enough numbers to hold the fort, but also whether Anwar can live up to his claim of having strong and convincing numbers.Anwar’s numbers will hinge on whether Warisan president Datuk Seri Shafie Apdal and Pejuang advisor Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad decide to come onboard.The reality is that both sides are struggling in this enervating numbers game.Political commentator and lawyer Khaw Veon Szu put it well in saying that any change of government, be it by the backdoor or the sidedoor, will not stable.“It will suffer the same fate as the current government. Whichever side we want to support, let them come in by the rightful way - through a general election,” said Khaw."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,Opinion,WONG CHUN WAI,Time for MPs to meet,"IT should be obvious by now that extending the Emergency when it ends on Aug 1 is not an option.The Rulers have made it clear that they aren’t keen on an extension. And that’s also the sentiment on the ground.It’s safe to say the Establishment and supporters of the government would want the same.There’s still a good six weeks to the end of the Emergency, and the Prime Minister won’t need to announce its conclusion.But Cabinet members must take the necessary steps and plan the days leading to the end of this situation.There’s nothing worse than senior Cabinet members exhibiting symptoms of the dreaded foot-in-mouth disease – contradicting and covering themselves in shame.The run-up to Aug 1 would be on engaging with stakeholders – especially civil servants, policy makers, business groups and the media – on preparations made leading to that date.This is where strategic communications come in, so a compromise beckons, and not because the government is perceived as reacting unwillingly to the advice of the Rulers.Politicians and lawyers will always have their arguments, and each time they make a statement, it doesn’t mean they’re right even if they sound convincing.Even well-qualified judges at the Federal Court vote accordingly on the verdict after hearing the points of law.But the bottom line is, the PM decides when the Emergency should end, and if he sees fit to recommend an extension, he will need the King’s consent.The King can decide on his own, without having to seek the consensus of the other Rulers.But His Majesty has prepared himself well. Ahead of Aug 1, he has rightly sought the advice of the Rulers, and they have told him two things – end the Emergency by August and have Parliament convene as soon as possible.I’m sure the PM and Cabinet fully respect the views of the King and the Rulers.Constitutional experts have outlined the vague points on who can really end the Emergency, but given our reverence for our Rulers, no Malay politician would risk losing their popularity by ignoring the palace.Also, it’s procedurally right for the PM to first hear the views of the independent special committee on the Emergency, and the Cabinet, too.If not, what would be the point of forming the special panel if their recommendations aren’t even heard and considered?Only when he has digested their feedback and formed his views can he seek an audience with the King to let His Majesty know his decision.I’m sure the PM is explicitly aware of the political effects of an extension to the Emergency.There would be little reason for him to do so knowing the King is against it. Besides, public opinion echoes that sentiment, too.However you slice it, when the PM first convinced the nation that the Emergency was necessary to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, most Malaysians agreed with it.After all, our leaders should be focused on ensuring we were safe from the deadly virus. In fact, during MCO1.0, public perception was that the government was doing a good job.But then, we went downhill. We are at MCO3.0 because we have gone from bad to worse. It’s gone off the rails with the numbers still increasing and the pandemic raging as we scramble with vaccinations.Have we come to a point where we’re supposed to celebrate when our daily number of Covid-19 cases drop to 4,000-odd? And are we serious about embracing leniency when there’s talk of it?At 4,000-odd, we’re surely not out of the woods because the forest is still on fire, so we can’t ease off the brakes.Our politicians gave in to the demands for Ramadan markets, interstate travel last December for Christmas and New Year, and then Gawai, just to score populist points. Unfortunately, that all added to new clusters.We can’t continue to concede to the pressure of our communities because the Health Ministry has already said it needs at least four months to flatten the curve, so the ban on inter-district travel for Gawai in Sarawak is a step in the right direction.Having communicated with key MOH officials struggling with the pandemic the last two years, this writer was told how tired, frustrated and even angry they’ve been.They’re aware of the balance needed to keep the country safe and also, the economy running.After all, these officials have families and friends who have shared with them the difficulties in keeping their jobs and businesses going. People are desperate, and many are starving as they struggle to put food on the table.But as these frontliners continue with their thankless work, let’s not make it difficult for them with silly calls for a general election, which could only send many of us to the morgue.Don’t be convinced by those who tell us that it’s safe to hold elections because they’re the same people who campaigned in the Sabah election last year and caused the entire country to suffer.Many of these campaigners, which included top politicians, flouted the standard operating procedures, and even ignored quarantine rules. So, if you believe these politicians will keep their promises, then you will believe anything.Moving ahead, as the Emergency period ends and Parliament resumes, let’s be prepared for all the usual drama, the likes of plots to overthrow the government and previously-unthinkable political alliances – mostly to keep players out of jail or to form a new government and enjoy the perks.Then there will also be politicians who should retire yet still think they are PM material, and politicians masquerading as theologians who use religion to justify their political acrobatics.We really need to stay safe from Covid-19, and now, also from such politicians."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,Opinion,THE STAR SAYS,Help to keep the vaccination rate up,"AS Malaysia intensifies its vaccination efforts to flatten the Covid-19 infection curve, companies and private organisations are also playing their part by offering to help the government in this crucial effort.It’s commendable that many have stepped forward to allow their facilities and manpower to be used for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme.Their contributions in the past weeks seem to be paying off as the country crossed the 200,000-dose mark with 215,876 jabs administered on Tuesday.To date, more than 1.5 million Malaysians – or 4.7% of the targeted 80% of the population – have completed their vaccination with two doses while another 5.3 million have received first doses.The interval between the first and second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is between 21 and 42 days, for Sinovac it’s 21 days, and for AstraZeneca it’s 12 weeks.Another one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine is scheduled to arrive later this month and in July while 12 million Sinovac doses are on track to be delivered by July – coupled with the accelerating rate of vaccination, Malaysia could actually achieve the 40% immunisation target by August.This is where help from local companies and organisations is needed to keep accelerating the vaccination rate.With the government hoping to increase the daily vaccination rate to between 300,000 and 400,000 shots in the next few weeks, more manpower and venues are needed.It would help immensely if more local companies and Malaysians could rise to the occasion and offer their space and volunteers to keep the programme running smoothly.The faster we all get vaccinated, the quicker the infection curve can be flattened, enabling the country to open up so we can get back on our feet and fix the besieged economy.Malaysians must do their part and register to get vaccinated.The Health Ministry has given its assurance that all those who have registered through the MySejahtera app will be given a date to receive their vaccines.If you haven’t registered yet, what are you waiting for?As millions are jabbed around the world, the evidence just keeps getting stronger: Apart from lessening the chances of catching Covid-19, if you do get it, being vaccinated lessens the risk of getting the severe form of the disease and, most importantly, of dying from it.While the government is trying hard to make sure Malaysia gets vaccinated quickly, the onus is on all of us to register for our vaccination appointments – and not to miss the date once we get it.Let’s do this together to get the nation back on track."
"Sunday, 20 Jun 2021",,Opinion,NATHANIEL TAN,#BangsaMalaysia dialogues,"THE concept of a #BangsaMalaysia is not new. It goes at least as far back as Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammad’s Wawasan 2020, which included the formation of a national identity.Other groups and civil society organisations have championed the formation of a #BangsaMalaysia identity over the years, but so far, traction has unfortunately been limited.Two factors that have contributed to this – one, the fact that there has yet to be a broad based movement for #BangsaMalaysia that truly cuts across multiple segments of society; and two, how political elites have generally been opposed to the idea.A lack of political will to implement and push a #BangsaMalaysia narrative may be related to race based parties that believe their relevance might be lessened should such a national identity become dominant.A fragmented civil society landscape has also hampered the creation of such a national identity from the ground up.This fragmentation mirrors the fragmentation of society over the past few decades. Where some expected the internet to be a great unifier, it may instead have encouraged echo chambers and the tendency to surround oneself primarily with those who think and speak like ourselves.The good news is that it is not too late to reverse this trend. There are many Malaysians who want to see a united #BangsaMalaysia. The big question is: how do we make it happen?I think if any individual or small group tried to give a top down definition of what #BangsaMalaysia should be, that definition would be meaningless.Perhaps the only meaningful definition of #BangsaMalaysia would be one which is defined together from the bottom up. This process would involve the coming together of Malaysians from all walks of life, and all parts of the country, to start the conversation about what it means to be Malaysian, and what the shared values that form the core of our national identity should be.We can’t expect everyone to have the same views on what those values should be – but if we have enough of these conversations with enough Malaysians, maybe we can identify which values keep coming up most frequently.These most frequently cited values would essentially constitute a common ground that can be subscribed to by the largest possible number of Malaysians. They would represent both the diverse aspirations of ordinary Malaysians as well as their vision for a better Malaysia.To get a truly representative picture, we’d need to engage the entire spectrum of communities that make up our beautifully diverse nation – including (but certainly not limited to) the majority Malay-Muslims, Chinese, Indians, Kadazans, Dayaks, Orang Asli, Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, Taoists, teachers, lawyers, engineers, small traders - from Perlis to Johor, Penang to Sabah, and everywhere in between.Besides conversations on shared values, this may also be a good time to have meaningful discussions about national policies.Sometimes, national policies are overly influenced by political calculations or other narrow interests. This is something of a tragedy, especially when there are at least hundreds of Malaysians who are experts in their policy sectors, who I bet could craft extremely good rakyat-centric policies.This is a long and involved journey of course, but like every other journey, it begins with a single step. It may be worthwhile to convene conversations with policy experts, perhaps starting with some big picture discussions about the roads Malaysia has taken so far with regards to specific policy sectors, and then, more importantly, what roads we should be taking moving forward.I personally would really love to hear from experts in fields like health policy, economics, education, the environment, migration, international trade, foreign policy, and so on, about how we ended up where we are, and where we should go next.While many think tanks and similar groups have organised similar initiatives, most of them are limited to a particular policy sector, and to the best of my knowledge, none have been organised as part of an overarching, comprehensive national initiative where each policy sector is seen as one piece of the grand Malaysian puzzle.Both these dialogue initiatives are deeply linked to the concept of social capital. Needless to say, talk that stays only talk is of limited use. What we want is talk that leads to greater mutual understanding, and even more importantly, relationship building.These types of relationships are absolutely vital when it comes to solving our nation’s problems. For instance, there is a tendency for conflicts involving race and religion to flare up quite frequently. When they do, the public domain is flooded with voices from either extreme, and most attention is focused on the angriest, loudest people.Those angry and loud people though, do not necessarily represent the middle majority of Malaysia, who prefer peacefulresolutions to conflict that are borne out of an atmosphere of mutual respect.When more relationships have been built between leaders of different communities, it becomes so much easier to pick up the phone and have conversations that can then lead to joint statements and leadership that emphasises resolving conflicts, and providing an alternate centre of gravity.This kind of diverse leadership can be an important element in defusing highly charged conflicts and championing moderate narratives.In the policy sector, greater dialogue between policy experts can perhaps lead to a policy bank - a ready to go set of policies for Malaysia that can be drawn on by anyone leading the country.The more voices there are at the policy making table, the more likely the emerging policies will represent the best, most comprehensive solutions to the problems at hand, and avoid pitfalls caused by having blindspots.Engaging meaningfully with so many diverse groups on both nation-building and policy formulation will surely be a gargantuan task - but not one that is impossible, in my humble opinion. Given how video conferencing has become the new normal, it is mostly a matter of who has the time and energy.I am delighted to report that indeed, some have already taken up the mantle. It’s going to require a lot of drive, but hopefully the first few dialogues in this spirit will help create enough momentum and interest to keep the initiative alive!Nathaniel Tan is working with POWR and Abim on Siri Dialog #BangsaMalaysia. Past and future dialogues are available on www.bit.ly/ProjekBangsaMalaysiaFB. He can be reached at nat@engage.my."
"Saturday, 19 Jun 2021",9:43 AM MYT,StarPicks,,"Fast, accurate testing needed to control Covid-19 in Malaysia","WITH the high number of daily Covid-19 cases despite the enforcement of the movement control order and the implementation of the national Covid-19 immunisation programme, it is timely to re-evaluate the current strategies for successful control of this raging pandemic.While there are many factors that have contributed to the third wave of Covid-19 in Malaysia, the element of testing plays a vital role in the management of the coronavirus disease.It was reported recently that Malaysia’s Covid-19 positive rate is higher than the threshold set by the World Health Organisation (WHO).Positivity rate indicates the portion of positive Covid-19 cases tested out of the total tests conducted. Higher positivity rates mean that more testing should be done, as it suggests that there are more people with the virus in the community who have not been detected yet.If in fact insufficient tests are being conducted, then the decrease in daily reported number of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia may not reflect the actual pandemic situation in the country.Taking a leaf out of other Asian countries’ booksThe surge in cases has undoubtedly put further strain on the swab collection system – adding further delay in identifying Covid-19 positive individuals and allowing them to be out in the community and at risk of infecting others while awaiting their results.To break the chain of infection, a proven strategy to step up testing using the RT-PCR with quick result turnaround time of no more than 24 hours must be employed nationwide. This will help to identify infected individuals effectively for isolation and treatment while reducing further spread of the virus to others.Asian countries that have been successful in their Covid-19 management despite being among the most impacted at the start of the pandemic are China, South Korea and Singapore. These countries learned quickly that test results must be fast and accurate – to prevent a huge backlog in testing centres, laboratories and the public health laboratory information system.For instance, South Korea has turned to point-of-care testing devices that can produce RT-PCR results within 30 to 60 minutes – much faster than standard diagnostic equipment which typically requires six hours.With these systems – namely the Veri-Q PREP M16 and Veri-Q PCR 316 manufactured by MiCo BioMed from South Korea – up to 288 tests per machine can potentially be processed within 24 hours without compromising accuracy.The South Korean success modelAlthough South Korea was one of the first countries to report Covid-19 infections outside China in late January 2020, it managed to prevent a disruptive nationwide epidemic and contained well any occasional flare-ups.Hence, South Korea was able to flatten the curve without closing businesses, issuing stay-at-home orders, or implementing many of the stricter measures adopted by other high-income countries.It achieved this success by conducting comprehensive testing, in addition to thorough contact tracing and many reforms to boost public health emergency preparedness and response.The South Korean government also worked closely with the private sector to ensure innovative and high-capacity screening facilities.A company at the forefront of this global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic is MiCo BioMed Co Ltd, a public listed company on the Korean stock market (KOSDAQ).Led by chief executive officer Sung Woo Kim, a former Korean-American scientist, the company has developed 30 different kinds of high-risk pathogen diagnostic kits for the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).The healthcare solutions developer announced in February 2020 its rapid molecular diagnostic system which detects the novel coronavirus with high sensitivity and accuracy within an hour.Since then, the Veri-Q PREP M16 and Veri-Q PCR 316 systems have been used in South Korea, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Romania, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, Colombia and the United States.Capable of conducting a minimum of two million tests per month depending on the number of machines deployed, the Veri-Q PCR 316 employs MiCo BioMed’s proprietary “Lab-on-a-Chip” technology to detect the smallest amount of virus at the earliest phase of infection.Additionally, the system’s lightweight and portable build (approximately 4kg) makes it suitable to be applied not only at healthcare centres, but also at airports, drive-through centres as well as quarantine sites at a lower cost setup.Post-pandemic, these devices also have the versatility of testing up to 14 different diseases including malaria and dengue.Planned entry into South-East Asian marketsTo complement the ongoing rollout of a nationwide vaccination programme in Malaysia, early and quick testing remains an important key to managing a virus outbreak especially as more variants are being discovered.Testing is crucial towards helping to treat, isolate or hospitalise infected people, while assisting public health officials to characterise the prevalence, speed and contagiousness of the virus.The efficient early containment testing systems that are used in South Korea will be an added advantage for this country.The equipment to test and provide timely results will enable frontliners to execute contact tracing with lower labour cost and shorter length of time required to act, which is exactly what Malaysia needs right now.By sharing South Korea’s lessons to apply fundamental principles in combatting Covid-19, aggressively tracking down infections and performing accurate testing, it is possible for the time-consuming and costly act of managing the pandemic to be mitigated significantly.Following its recent expansion into South-East Asian markets, MiCo BioMed has expressed interest to share its expertise with Malaysia and strive to meet the increasing need for Covid-19 diagnostic testing and other diseases beyond the pandemic.For more information on MiCo BioMed and its products, email its sole authorised reseller (SEA) at medical@asiacodingcentre.com or contact them at 03-6413 3533."

MAGESWARI,"Heng Hiap Industries, a testament of MATRADE’s support for Malaysian mid-tier companies in sustainability","Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (MATRADE) has been instrumental in grooming mid-tier companies (MTCs) from various industries to become global champions.Leveraging on sustainability as pre-requisite to enhance the competitiveness, MATRADE has identified relevant companies with potential products and technologies that can be promoted further in the international marketplace.With MATRADE’s support and assistance, one of these companies that succeeded in making it in the global plastic industry is the multiple award winning integrated plastic recycling company Heng Hiap Industries Sdn Bhd (HHI).In sustainability agenda, HHI is the first in the world to receive Ocean Bound Plastic (OBP) certification initiated by Zero Plastic Ocean, audited by Control Union and witnessed by World Wildlife Fund (WWF).According to HHI founder and chief executive officer Seah Kian Hoe, MATRADE has been consistently offering different marketing programmes and exhibition opportunities abroad, through which the company reached out to more customers from different countries and various industrial players.“We couldn’t be prouder to be an exhibitor overseas together with MATRADE. The joint exhibition with MATRADE is more effective than an individual company, as we are representing the country when at exhibitions like K-Fair in Germany,” he shared.“MATRADE overseas offices have been constantly promoting HHI and providing new customer leads to us,” he said in email interview.Seah added: “MATRADE has been able to connect to a wide variety of informal communities, including tailgate sorter, faith-based charity group, Tzu Chi, material pickers, building cleaner, and mobile collectors.”On how HHI succeeded in developing technology to safely break down plastic waste into clean and sustainable raw materials, he said that they have built a standard protocol for plastic waste collection among the 28,000 communities to ensure the consistency of quality before they start processing the material into smart plastics.“The entire production process is strictly controlled by ISO9001 standard. The quality assurance department regularly checks the finished goods via in-house testing instrument including XRF machine complying with RoHS1 for detection of heavy metal contaminant,” he revealed.As of 2020, the company has 18 intellectual property and one trademark, while three more trademarks will be registered this year.In its plastics recycling business, HHI adopts mechanical recycling (plastic waste into pelletize material that fulfill the industrial standard, converting three types of recycled plastics: rPP, rPE and rPET), and chemical recycling (converting of non-recycled plastic waste into an energy carrier or Naphtha like feedstock).On HHI’s role in promoting sustainable environmental practices, Seah said, they have been practising the 5Cs – collect, convert, co-create, champion and consume.HHI’s growth initiatives support three key sustainability goals: promoting circularity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preventing waste leakages into the environment.HHI intends to be the leading recycling company to offer technology-enabled offerings and revolutionise the recycling landscape, in the future.Besides that, he said, HHI is pioneering a digital platform that will maximise value for its stakeholders in the plastic recyclables collection value chain.“The journey of the recyclable waste will be shared with the consumers to highlight the impact created by their contribution.“The key goals of HHI digital platform, or the HHI smart recycling app, includes educating the general public on importance and basics of recycling, increasing participation and engagement, leading to increase in recycling volumes, as well as optimising value chain logistics,” he added.Seah thanked MATRADE for the strong support given in developing HHI’s competitive advantage and equip them with relevant tools to position themselves as the global player in the plastics industry.He highlighted that the Mid-Tier Companies Development Programme (MTCDP) by MATRADE helped the company to strengthen its core business function. For the record, HHI was the participant in Wave 5, MTCDP in 2017.“Throughout the Mid-Tier Market Immersion Programme, HHI is able to prove ourselves and stand out in the global market. For instance, we are one of the largest recycled plastic material supplier in Australia and New Zealand.”Through exporters development programme like MTCDP, MATRADE will be able to create more export champions and support the ongoing efforts by the Government in regenerating Malaysian economy, driving the growth of new sectors while striking the balance to ensure the socio-economic inclusiveness and sustainability.MATRADE is currently recruiting new participants for the programme. The MTCDP targets MTCs with annual revenues between RM50mil and RM500mil for manufacturing companies, while RM20mil to RM500mil for services companies.Interested companies are encouraged to contact midtier@matrade.gov.my for more details."

"Friday, 18 Jun 2021",7:41 AM MYT,StarPicks,,The Future of Mobility,"The Institute of Transport Infrastructure for Smart Mobility at Universiti Teknologi Petronas advances research on transport systems to increase productivity, safety and security while reducing congestion, pollution and operating costs.AT the Institute of Transport Infrastructure for Smart Mobility (ITI) in Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP), researchers look at transport in the most general sense as the movement of people and commodities through roads, railways, airways and waterways in urban/suburban, or plantation, agriculture and offshore settings to access required services and facilities. Given the pressing demands for sustainability, this movement has to now take into account several factors.This is where smart mobility comes in. It’s a megatrend that considers the seamless movement of people and things from one point to another using any means of transport while also bearing in mind cost, efficiency and impact on the environment.Designing smart mobility solutions, whether it is to ferry large groups of people or transporting goods across challenging terrain, hinges on there being the necessary, supportive infrastructure.This is where the work of ITI comes in. Organised under the pillar of smart communities, research undertaken at the institute considers smart mobility through the integration of three main elements - infrastructure, vehicles and operations – to create on-demand personal, and materials mobility systems that increase productivity, safety and security while reducing congestion, pollution and operating costs.ITI director Prof Dr Abd Rashid Abd Aziz says the institute’s work encompasses three research clusters focusing on automotive and transportation, infrastructure monitoring and maintenance, diagnostic and reliability.Members of the multi-disciplinary institute hail from the electrical and electronics engineering, mechanical engineering and civil engineering departments – creating a rich and exciting research environment for prospective postgraduate students. The robust research culture at UTP – where 90% of academicians are principal investigators – means that postgraduate students often dive straight into a project.An added advantage for prospective postgraduate students is the research funding available. Each year, the institute receives RM3mil to RM5mil new research grants from the Higher Education Ministry, the Science, Technology and Innovation Ministry as well as the Petronas Group.“When students join a centre or group, with a professor leading the group, then they can be assured that they are part of that research ecosystem. For example, my Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) students work alongside research officers and post-doctoral staff, collecting data and then using and analysing the data, which will then form part of their thesis,” he says, adding that these are most often industry-based projects. “So, this means that students are exposed to working with industry, and gain experience and knowledge from these interactions with industry.""“For postgraduate students interested in doing something futuristic, for example securing a breakthrough, then this is the place for them,” he says, adding that the work is often pioneering. “In UTP, you have to ensure that whatever you are doing, be it fundamental or applied research, addresses the pain points of industry.”He points to the example of the study on water and diesel emulsion aimed at reducing pollution and improving fuel economy without compromising on the engine’s power output. This fundamental research project, he adds, will eventually lead to solutions for industry as well as address global emission and greenhouse gas emission issues.“We work with industry because they know what are the real pain points. The advantage that industry has of working with us is our facilities, manpower and the fundamental knowledge, all of which can be applied to solve their problems. So, it's more than trial and error but a scientific investigation,” he adds. Industry partners include those from the automotive, oil and gas, telecommunications and plantation sectors.Rich research environmentSome of the notable research projects undertaken include Dr Rashid’s own pet project on the use of the free piston linear generator as a future power source.“At the moment it’s an electric generator like the diesel gen-sets used at night markets but in the future this can be used as static power generation for electric vehicles charging infrastructure,” he says, not discounting the possibility that one day vehicles will pull into fuelling stations equipped with these generators to recharge their electric cars. “It can even be used as an on-board power unit,” he adds.The institute is also looking at autonomous mobility for the agriculture sector, specifically vehicles that can roam plantations autonomously while carrying out inspection and collection jobs or the spraying of pesticides.“We also have groups looking at developing communication tools based on the Internet of Things technology. One of the institute’s innovations is a people-locator tag, which has a transmitter and receiver and sub-protocol to determine a person’s location. So you can track the movement of your employees continuously in real time in a power plant or offshore platform for example, which is important for optimisation, security and safety.Organisations as well as hajj and umrah operators for example, have expressed interest in the innovation to track the movements of pilgrims in Mecca. In an emergency you can account for and know where your employees or people are,” he says, disclosing that the research group is already in talks with a company to commercialise the product.Given the pioneering work undertaken at the institute, it’s not surprising that it boasts cutting-edge facilities. The Centre for Automotive Research and Electric Mobility (CAREM) for example, is equipped with a high-speed digital camera, which is able to image flame development in a combustion chamber. With up to 0.5 million frames per second (fps) capability (compared to a handphone that can only record up to 30 fps), the camera is able to capture the evolution of a flame.“This is important to test how good a fuel is and make the necessary improvements because the faster the flame burns the faster the energy is produced so the better the engine performance. So students can use these same facilities for their research,” he says, adding that the research facilities are also used by the institute’s global industry collaborators.UTP, which is ranked 70th in the QS Asia University Rankings 2021 also has a high ratio of international community among the staff and students. This offers postgraduate students a unique global intellectual and cultural experience.For more information on UTP’s postgraduate programmes, visit www.utp.edu.my"

"Thursday, 17 Jun 2021",7:29 AM MYT,Business,,SIRIM to accelerate ABMS uptake in Malaysia,"THERE can be no compromise on corruption. This is the message Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Mohd Zuki Ali sent out to the civil service in April this year.Corruption has the far-reaching potential to bring about deterioration in the highest levels of government and cause nations to fall.According to a World Bank report, countries with a high level of corruption have one-third the average income, three times the infant mortality rate and 25% literacy lower than countries with lower levels of corruption.In line with the National Anti-Corruption Plan (NACP) 2019-2023, all government ministries shall obtain the Anti-Bribery Management Systems (ABMS) certification from SIRIM QAS International.Fighting Corruption in the Public SectorAccording to the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), 2, 607 civil servants were arrested for corruption from 2015 to October 2020.Meanwhile, the 2018 Transparency International Malaysia (TIM) estimated that corruption cost Malaysia 4% of its GDP every year since 2013 – about RM212.3bil lost because of graft over five years.Another point of concern is Malaysia’s drop in rankings – from 51 in 2019 to 56 in 2020 – in the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index (TI-CPI). Given that Malaysia climbed 10 steps from 61 in 2018 to 51 in 2019, the drop needs to be redressed.The private sector’s roles and responsibilitiesPrivate sector corruption also has serious consequences.For instance, corruption in public sector procurement often involves offering gratification to civil servants for a favourable decision. Therefore, the contracted company may not be the best in terms of service and/or price.KPMG's 2013 Fraud, Bribery and Corruption Survey indicated 90% of respondents in Malaysia said bribery and corruption were the biggest problem for businesses.In 2020, the Corporate Liability provision under Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) Amendment Act 2018 came into force.This provision requires organisations to proactively prevent corruption in their processes by making directors and managers liable to prosecution for acts of corruption committed on behalf of the company, whether officially or unofficially.No longer is ignorance a viable defence, as the provision requires directors and managers to not only prove they are unaware of the corrupt act, but had taken all due diligence to ensure it does not occur.ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems (ABMS)The ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems (ABMS) enables organisations to equip themselves with the necessary tools and knowledge to identify, prevent and respond to bribery risks.Being certified by the ABMS enables organisations to demonstrate their commitment to inculcate a culture of transparency and integrity, which will further enhance trust and confidence in them.For private sector organisations, ABMS will strengthen their internal processes to safeguard against violations of the Corporate Liability provision.As for the public sector, it will safeguard important processes, plug leakages and wastages of public money and help build public trust.SIRIM QAS International – a trusted partnerA wholly-owned subsidiary of SIRIM Berhad and Malaysia’s leading testing, inspection and certification (TIC) body, SIRIM QAS is ready to help organisations demonstrate their commitment to the fight against corruption.SIRIM QAS is the first and only certification body (CB) accredited for the MS ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems (ABMS) by the Department of Standards Malaysia (DSM).As the national CB, SIRIM QAS has over 30 years of experience in providing conformity assessment services to Malaysian and foreign organisations, and boasts a highly experienced talent pool of auditors.Accreditation from DSM further enhances the credibility of its certifications.Since 2017, SIRIM QAS has served 37 ministries and government agencies to receive certification. Given that there are over 700 ministries and agencies, the number of current organisations certified with ABMS is worryingly low.Part of the reason could be a lack of understanding about the certification process and implementation.With the recent announcement by the Chief Secretary, ministries and agencies should ramp up efforts to get ABMS certified.Organisations may seek assistance in preparing their processes to be ABMS-ready from a professional training service provider such as SIRIM STS – a leading training provider for many types of certification including the ABMS."

It’s time to learn the goodness,"AS we’re all aware, milk not only provides a good package of nutrients that children need while growing up, but is also a great way to get filling protein, which is important to maintain the immune system and muscles, while helping build, maintain and repair cells.But do you know what’s in the milk you drink?Today, most regular cow’s milk contains a combination of two main milk proteins known as the A1 and A2 milk proteins.Back in the day, however, it’s a different story, because over 5,000 years ago, cows naturally produced only A2 milk protein, defined as the original, complete source of protein containing natural carbohydrates for energy.But many would have never heard of A2 milk protein or have never known the benefits of this particular protein. In fact, A2 milk protein has become an extremely precious source - only 30% of cows worldwide are pure A2 cow breeds that produce pure A2 milk protein.That’s because a natural genetic mutation occurred somewhere along the way and most of our milk-producing friends started producing A1 milk protein as well.What are the differences between A1 & A2 milk protein?In a nutshell, the difference appears to boil down to digestion. A1 and A2 milk proteins only differ in structure by one amino acid, but that tiny variance may have a big impact on the way the protein is digested.Emerging evidence from studies in preschool children and adults suggest that milk with A2 milk protein is less likely to be associated with digestive discomfort - think a heavy or full stomach, bloating, abdominal pain and flatulence - after milk consumption1.Research shows that A2 milk containing only A2 milk protein is less associated with digestive discomfort1Making an informed choiceParents always want the best for their children and choosing the type of formula milk they drink is a big deal.For parents looking for natural children’s milk formula and some children may be sensitive to regular milk with A1 & A2 milk protein, Enfagrow A+ has formulated the new Enfagrow AII MindPro.

"Tuesday, 15 Jun 2021",7:29 AM MYT,StarPicks,,Value-for-money 3+0 UK degree programme from Derby,"THE University of Derby (UOD) 3+0 programme offered by the Department of Management Studies (DOMS) at the HELP Academy is a value proposition that many students aiming for an internationally recognised business degree from the UK find hard to resist.The programmes offered are the BA (Hons) Accounting and Finance, BA (Hons) Business Management and the BA (Hons) Business Management (International Business).These are supplemented by three diploma programmes and a certificate programme that provide a pathway for school leavers to enter the degree programmes. These are the Diploma in Accounting, Diploma in Business Management and Diploma in Marketing, and the Certificate in Business Management.UOD is a modern and innovative public university with a 170-year history. It grew from the Derby College of Art and Technology and is ranked among the top 30 UK universities by the Guardian University Guide 2020.Its other impressive credentials include being ranked among the top 10 UK universities for Business, Management and Marketing honours degree courses, and among the top 10 for Accounting and Finance honours courses (Guardian University Guide 2020).Students selecting the relevant module pathway will be given maximum exemptions by the ACCA to qualify for professional membership to accelerate their careers.Graduates of this programme have gone on to excel in local practice, multinational accounting firms, merchant banks and other major financial institutions and businesses.The BA (Hons) Business Management involves combining elements from diverse subjects (e.g. Management Principles, Managing Financial Resources, Business Economics, Understanding People in Organisations) and applying them in scenarios like setting up a business, identifying a target market, mounting an advertising campaign, and preparing business plans and cash flows.This kind of experience and practical application of knowledge make this a unique course to prepare graduates for a successful management career.The BA (Hons) Business Management (International Business) focuses on the way businesses work across the world and provides a solid foundation for those intent on a career in a multinational or an international business.Graduates will be highly employable in sectors like international trade, transport and logistics corporations, financial institutions involved with trade and investment, firms engaged with business process outsourcing, government agencies involved in international trade and international business consultancy.For admission into these three attractive degrees, the entry requirements are three credits in any subject for SPM (or equivalent) and B6 for UEC; except for the Diploma in Accounting, which must include Maths.Admission to the Certificate in Business Management only requires one credit in any subject in SPM (or equivalent) or B6 for UEC. This gives a significant advantage, as students can subsequently proceed to any of the above diploma courses and complete a UOD degree in four and a half years.The UOD Business Management and International Business degrees are accredited by the Chartered Management institute (CMI, UK) which is dedicated to nurturing management and leadership skills in professionals. Students registered in these two programmes at DOMS receive an added bonus: they are given Affiliate Membership of CMI during their studies, and on completion they receive a Diploma in Management and Leadership from the CMI.The Diploma in Management and Leadership (a CMI Level 5 qualification) is a comprehensive course designed to provide candidates all the skills and knowledge required of a senior manager; it normally takes 18 months to complete.One big attraction of the UOD degrees at DOMS is the 10-day trip to the UOD campus in the UK provided by HELP as an essential part of the programme.Students literally become part of the student body, participating in academic activities like lectures and seminars led by the UOD academic faculty; they meet and network with Derby students and faculty members, and visit the university’s industry partners like Rolls Royce. They also receive a warm welcome from the Mayor of Derby city.At leisure time, they visit London and other cities to shop and to appreciate the rich cultural heritage of England. The more enterprising and adventurous students organise side trips to parts of the UK and to European cities both before and after the study trip. This is an irresistible value proposition as their airfare is covered by the trip.Students testify to the value of the UOD programme with great enthusiasm.Raja Nur Syazwina (BA Hons Business Management with First Class Honours) says “One highlight is the mandatory industrial training which greatly enhanced my learning capabilities and analytical skills that ultimately led to my First Class Honours result”.Raja Nur Syazwina’s credentials helped her secure a job as an investment analyst at Amara Investment Management.Kelly Yap Pye Venn (BA Hons Accounting and Finance) admits: ""I like calculations and numbers, thus my interest in accounting and finance. It also opened doors to the corporate world. The free trip to the Derby campus in the UK was important for me; it was not just a vacation but also an exposure to the university, particularly the culture and the environment. This programme and the international study trip gave me many memorable experiences; it also reminds me there are many challenges out there for me to overcome, using the knowledge I have gained.""For more information on programmes, call 03-2716 2000 or email marketing@help.edu.my"
