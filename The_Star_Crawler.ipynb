      "PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is expected to announce its decision soon on whether children should be included in the country’s Covid-19 immunisation programme.The current plan currently only covers those aged 18 and above, but a growing number of other countries have already started to vaccinate children.The government is currently studying whether Malaysia should follow suit. If the country were to decide to vaccinate its children, what would it involve?According to the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme document, Malaysia currently aims to vaccinate at least 23.6 million people aged 18 and above.Calculations based on the most recent available figures show that vaccinating children aged 12 and above, as several other countries have done, would raise the number vaccinated to at least 26.25 million people.With Malaysia's population currently estimated at 32.77 million according to the Statistic Department's online population clock (www.dosm.gov.my), vaccinating 12- to 17-year-olds could, in theory, help Malaysia meet its aim of covering up to 80% of its population.A population vaccination coverage of 80% is often mentioned by experts as a minimum estimate for a country to achieve herd immunity from Covid-19, though there is no exact figure.“Although no one is certain of the percentage of the population required to be vaccinated before we can hinder the spread of Covid-19 in the community, we do know that this will be difficult without vaccinating children,” senior consultant pediatrician Datuk Dr Amar Singh HSS wrote in an article published by the MySinChew news portal.More than three million children in Malaysia aged between 12 and 17 would get vaccinated if the government decides to include the age group.According to the Children Statistics 2020 report, there were an estimated 2.65 million children who are aged 13-17 as of last year (2020).Those aged 7-12 meanwhile total 3.01 million, according to the report released by the department.Selangor had the biggest number of 13- to 17-year-olds as of last year, with about 475,800 followed by Sabah (374,500), Johor (303,400), Sarawak (246,100) and Perak (202,600).Among the countries which have reportedly begun vaccinating children or have approved jabs for children 12 and above are Singapore, the Philippines, Japan, Britain and the United States.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The World Health Organization (WHO) was first alerted on Dec 31,2019, to the presence of several pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, which did not match any other known virus.A week later, Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a new virus.The new virus was temporarily named “2019-nCoV.”On Feb 11, the WHO named the disease caused by 2019-nCoV virus as \"Covid-19\", which stands for ‘Corona Virus Disease’.The virus spread rapidly, and exactly a month later on March 11 the United Nations agency responsible for international public health declared a pandemic - the worldwide spread of a new disease.Despite the number of infections, it is important to also note that many people affected by Covid-19 have managed to recover after getting treatment.READ ALSO > Covid-19: Current situation in Malaysia (updated daily)Any outbreak of an infectious disease has a ramping-up period, followed by a peak of intensity, then a decline, giving a bell-shaped curve.The following is a map showing the distribution of Covid-19 cases:\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: A total of 3,330,436 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered under the country’s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme as at June 3.The vaccination rate has been rising for the past few weeks after getting off to a slow start and on May 27 the number of jabs given daily breached the 100,000 mark, with 107,340 doses administered.The vaccination programme started on Feb 24 with a target of covering at least 80% of the country’s adult population.The vaccination programme is being carried out in three phases.The first covers frontliners.The second which began on April 19 involves high-risk groups and those aged 60 and above.The rest of the Malaysian population aged 18 years and above will be vaccinated in the third phase, which is expected to start soon.Here’s how the states and federal territories are progressing:The following graph shows the percentage of Malaysia's population who have received at least one vaccine dose, versus others in Asean as well as South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and Taiwan.In terms of vaccine registrations, 12,584,422 people or 51.9% of Malaysia's population who are aged 18 and above have signed up as at June 2.There were significant spikes in registrations especially on May 2 - the first round of opt-ins for the AstraZeneca vaccine - and on May 26, when those below the age of 60 were allowed to book during the second round of opt-ins.The country recorded a total of 603,122 Covid-19 infections with 515,571 recoveries and 3,182 deaths as at June 4.Among Asean countries, Malaysia currently has the highest cumulative confirmed Covid-19 cases per million people, according to Oxford University's Our World in Data (OWID)website:In terms of Covid-19 deaths per million people among Asean countries, the OWID portal puts Malaysia third behind the Philippines and Indonesia as at June 3, 2021:One of the things health authorities and experts measure when trying to find out where things are headed is the infection’s reproduction number, called R0 (pronounced as “R naught”).The R value refers to the number of people that a person who has the coronavirus will infect.If the R value is 1 for example, it means that on average, one infected person will spread Covid-19 to one other individual.An R value higher than 1 means that the number of cases will increase.However, if the R value goes down, the disease will eventually stop spreading as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.Malaysia announced its first Covid-19 cases on Jan 25, 2020, involving three tourists who entered via Johor from Singapore on Jan 23.The number of cases then rose to 22 by Feb 16 last year, representing the first wave of cases.The second wave of cases began on Feb 27, 2020, followed by the third wave that began on Sept 20.The following is how the third wave of infections developed in each state and federal territory:\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The number of people in Malaysia infected with Covid-19 but who were only taken to hospital after dying of the disease is going up at an alarming rate.In May alone, we saw 123 deaths that the Health Ministry categorises as “brought in dead” (BID). The figure represents 47% of the 261 BID cases recorded in the country this year.Health experts said a detailed study needs to be done to find out why this happening, adding that the trend could be due to two possible factors.The first is that some people infected with Covid-19 did not take their initial symptoms seriously, only to face a rapid deterioration in their medical condition and as a result died before they could be taken to hospital.The second possible reason could be the widespread presence of more virulent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes Covid-19.In any case, the experts said that the worrying trend underscores the importance of people closely monitoring themselves for any possible symptom and sticking to the standard operating procedure (SOP) such as social distancing and wearing masks when out, in order to better protect themselves.As at the end of May, Malaysia has recorded 2,796 Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic reached our shores last year, of which 293 or 10% were classified as BID.The majority of BID cases occurred in Sabah (29%), followed by Selangor (27.6%) and Kuala Lumpur (10.9%).While Sabah had more BID cases last year, this year saw Selangor recording the most number of such cases.In terms of age, most of the BID cases involved patients aged between 60 and 69 (24.2%), followed by those between 50 and 59 (20.5%) and the 70-79 age group (16%). The 30-39 age group made up 8.5% of the overall BID cases in the country.The youngest Covid-19 patient who was brought in dead, in Tawau Hospital on Nov 28,2020, was a four-year-old in Sabah.Most BID cases had a medical history of hypertension and diabetes. However, 31.7% or 93 of the cases did not have any record of medical illness.The Health Ministry said on May 28 that the rising number of BID cases involved three possible scenarios, with the first scenario comprising patients who did not undergo Covid-19 screening despite developing symptoms such as fever and cough.The second scenario involved confirmed Covid-19 patients who were found dead at home before they could be sent to a quarantine centre or hospital.\"Scenario three involves patients who experience the loss of sense of taste and fatigue but did not take these symptoms seriously. The patient only rested at home and after a few days, was found dead,\" the ministry said in a tweet.Universiti Malaya epidemiologist Prof Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud said the rise in Covid-19 patients who are brought in dead to hospitals may be due to several factors, including newer Covid-19 variants which are more virulent, resulting in a more rapid deterioration in the patient’s condition.Another possible reason that the infected person failed to seek proper medical attention quickly enough is that they brushed off their initial symptoms as a common cold or minor cough.\"Other factors may be due medical facilities being far away and not readily accessible, like in remote areas of Sabah and Sarawak,\" he added.In order to ensure infected persons receive the medical attention they need, Dr Awang Bulgiba stressed that a data analysis should be done to determine the type of patients who are likely to deteriorate.\"Factors that can predict disease progression may be modifiable but the correct analysis needs to be carried out to find out what those factors are,\" he said.Dr Awang Bulgiba also proposed that an epidemiological analysis be combined with genomic surveillance to prevent the spread of new undetected variants that will be a threat to the community.“Hardly 0.08% of virus samples are being sent for genome sequencing, ” he said, describing the figure as “dismal.”The medical condition of home-quarantined patients should be monitored more closely through the possible use of mobile applications that would allow the process to be done remotely.Dr Awang Bulgiba urged the government to ramp up vaccination efforts to between 300,000 to 500,000 doses per day.\"With half a million doses per day, the country can achieve herd immunity in just 100 days or within six months if we vaccinate at a rate of 300,000 doses per day.“However, the current rate is far below this number, so this is worrying,\" he added.Commenting on the increasing number of BID cases, Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman said a study involving animals in India has shown that the new coronavirus variant in that country is associated with more severe clinical manifestations.\"We are still studying the clinical data, but I believe the new strains of the virus may play a role in the deterioration of the symptoms,\" she said, adding that there is the possibility of multi-strains infections but should be proven by more research and clinical data.Dr Malina said that among the risk factors of developing severe Covid-19 and deaths are undiagnosed chronic diseases or medical illnesses that can lead to an immunocompromised patient (having an impaired immune system).\"Some of the factors include the person's compliance to put an effort to get and have the prescribed treatment, effort by the caretakers to help monitor the symptoms as well as the general attitude and practice towards SOP compliance,\" she said.She advised those who are infected to closely follow medical advice and to get help from others such as family members, neighbours or friends to keep tabs on them in case their condition worsens.Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy reiterated that delays in seeking medical attention, failure to recognise severe symptoms of Covid-19, and newer variants may have contributed to the rise in BID cases.\"Issues of getting quick access to healthcare especially in the remote interiors in Sabah and Sarawak may also be a factor,\" he said.Dr Subramaniam said proper assessments and monitoring are key to reducing BID cases, with those infected needing to be properly educated on the various Covid-19 categories to know if their symptoms are worsening from mild or moderate to severe.\"The CAC (Covid-19 assessment centre) would need to ensure more thorough assessments and the district health office would need to ensure all patients on home monitoring are checked on regularly.\"The Health Ministry must also be clear on when a patient should seek care at a hospital's emergency department,\" he said, adding that the patient's family or caregiver will need to be on alert to call in for medical attention if symptoms worsen.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Computer science graduate Muadz Halim normally tweets about football and Japanese manga, but when Israel attacked Palestine earlier this month, his focus expanded.The 23-year-old from Perak began to retweet and use pro-Palestine hashtags from early May, at a rate of 80 to 120 times each day.\"I hope that by doing this, I can at least raise awareness among my social media followers that the Palestinians are suffering and that we need to always support and show them solidarity.\"My greatest hope is that Palestine will be free and that there will be no more suffering,” said Muadz, who has racked up a total of 2,707 mentions and retweets on the topic.He is one of an army of local social media users actively spreading awareness on the topic, making Malaysians among the most prolific in the world in terms of expressing support for and solidarity with Palestine online, especially on Twitter.This is among the findings of an analysis by The Star which tracked the popularity of pro-Palestine hashtags among users of the social networking service.Social media monitoring software was used to search for 92 chosen keywords including popular hashtags and phrases that express support for and solidarity with Palestinians or which condemn Israel over its attacks.Most of the keywords were in English, and the majority of the social media posts tracked were on Twitter.The search found 31.26 million mentions by social media users from 193 countries over a one-month period from April 19 to May 19.Of the total, 1.18 million mentions came from Malaysians, making us the second most prolific, behind US-based social media users with 1.24 million mentions.Social media users in Pakistan came in third with 979,175 mentions, followed by people in Egypt (926,593) and India (858,704).Among the most popular hashtags mentioned or retweeted by Malaysians were #freepalestine, #savepalestine, #savesheikhjarrah, #gazaunderattack, #Israelterrorist and #Israelkoyak.Twenty-nine-year-old Syahmi Nazir, who has also been actively supporting Palestine on Twitter, expressed hope that it would help lead to action.Syahmi, who is known as @syahminamon on Twitter, posts five to seven tweets an hour on the issue in his free time, racking up a total 1,874 mentions on the topic since April 19.The 29-year-old entrepreneur who lives in Subang Jaya, Selangor, felt many people still lack an understanding of the extent of suffering in Palestine.\"We need to keep applying pressure and raise awareness until the people in power give Palestinians the basic rights they deserve, and uphold justice.”Student Nurul Aina Zulkarnaen from Terengganu said she spends her free time during the movement control order spreading awareness on the situation in Palestine in the hope that it might bring about positive change.Using the Twitter handle @callmeeyna, the 20-year-old has 1,041 pro-Palestine posts and hashtag retweets over the past month.\"I wish that the Palestinians will get freedom like what we have.“Their children have the right to a bright future and a peaceful life,” she said.Student Farah Aleeysha, who goes by @borahaedef7 on Twitter, said she retweets and posts 200 messages a day to show her support for Palestine, which she says is a sacred land for Muslims.\"Israel is showing its true colours but only a few countries are brave enough to stand up to it.\"By using my voice collectively with others, I can help create awareness on the atrocities and cruelty committed by Israel, and social media is helping us to achieve that,” said the 19-year-old.\n",

      "Suffering In SilenceHow the Pandemic is Affecting the Mental Health of Our ChildrenBY DIYANA PFORDTENNadia, a Form Five student, is the eldest among three siblings.Nadia is a composite character.She is drawn from descriptions by psychiatrists interviewed for this story, who were asked about the children – some as young as eight years old – in need of their help ever since the pandemic started.Adults are not the only people whose lives have been turned upside down by Covid-19.Children are also facing greater anxiety, depression and isolation due to school closures and sudden changes in their daily routines and interactions.Many are unable to cope but don’t know what to do and parents sometimes fail to notice that their children need help.The pandemic’s toll on the mental health of our school going children is a growing problem that parents and everyone in society need to pay more attention to, warn the experts.SOLS Health research and advocacy director Dr Arman Rashid said some of the mental health stressors experienced by children – exam stress, isolation from friends, anxiety about the future - are not unique to the pandemic but are escalated by it.SOLS Health research and advocacy director Dr Arman RashidDr Arman highlighted that the closure of schools means the lack of avenue for children to develop their socio-emotional needs besides fulfilling educational purposes.“Schools serve as an important support system for students with teachers and peers playing a role in their emotional wellbeing.“This important role of schools in the life of children was hampered during the pandemic. As a result, many children feel increasingly lonely, isolated and detached,” he said.Dr Arman pointed out the pandemic has also escalated uncertainty over future educational and employment plans, particularly for older students.“Generally speaking, all children have been affected by the pandemic but even more so for SPM/STPM students and those from B40 (bottom 40%) households,” he said, adding that burnout, exhaustion and anxiety over needing to perform well in exams escalated as students felt inadequately prepared.“The stress is higher for students from B40 families as many cannot get internet access, laptops or mobile devices for online classes, or access to devices. Many are also part of larger class sizes in school,” he said.Dr Arman highlighted that there are long-term implications of the pandemic for both mental health and education of students.“If students continue to face mental health stressors during this period, it can cause short-term and long-term problems in psychosocial functioning and day to day life, including academic performance, relationships, morale and others.“Though all children have been affected by the pandemic, coping is dependent on their own level of resilience and support system around them,” he said.Universiti Malaya Specialist Centre consultant psychiatrist Assoc Prof Dr Amer Siddiq Amer Nordin said he has been receiving a rising number of children between the age of eight to 12 years old who are in need of mental health support since the second movement control order.“Due to the pandemic, these children are learning online and parents who previously had control in terms of gadget time, now have very little control as it is the mandatory way of learning.“Kids are being exposed to higher degree of online time and we know that online time is a risk factor for online issues such as cyberbully,” he said.Universiti Malaya Specialist Centre consultant psychiatrist Assoc Prof Dr Amer Siddiq Amer NordinDr Amer noted that children, who lack understanding of the implication of their action, may resort to writing nasty things, photoshopping or calling names.“Because they were not taught on how to manage social media and have little understanding on how to regulate their emotions, these actions lead them to face emotional issues, mainly stress which then develops into depress mode.“Those without a support system will keep their problems to themselves to the extent that some develop depression and even harm themselves,” he said.Dr Amer highlighted that these children may display physical symptoms such as eating disorder, poor emotional control, deterioration in school performance or showing risk of self-harm.“To address this, parents need to teach their children what emotions are, name them and also validate them,” he said.Parents, added Dr Amer, need to bring their children for professional help if symptoms deteriorate as professional mental assessments can also reveal the child’s condition aggravated due to history of trauma, having divorced parents, medical comorbidities or drug or porn addiction.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), mental health conditions account for 16% of the global burden of disease and injury in people aged 10 to 19 years.“Half of all mental health conditions start by 14 years of age but most cases are undetected and untreated,” it said, adding that globally, depression is one of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents.WHO noted that the consequences of not addressing mental health and psychosocial development for children and adolescents extend to adulthood and limit opportunities for leading fulfilling lives.In Malaysia, the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2019 found that 424,000 children in the country were experiencing mental health problems.Dr Arman, who is also the former project manager of Humankind Buddy Bear, stressed on the need for children to have access to both formal and informal mental health support during the pandemic, including emotional support from teachers, parents and peers.“We must adopt a preventive approach, with parents and caregivers playing an important role in addressing emotional challenges faced by students.“Parents can help foster a supportive and positive environment for emotional expression and help-seeking at home.\"This involves listening and acknowledging feelings of children beyond meeting their physical needs,” he said.Parents and caregivers, said Dr Arman, are best placed to see early warning signs of mental health stressors, including connecting with mental health professionals if there is persistent distress.He also stressed that children also need more proactive involvement and supervision during online learning.“Emotional check-ins with children are very important. Parents need to look out for early warning signs like difficulties in concentration, frequent headaches, fatigue, irritability or sleep disruptions to offer emotional support.“If there are early responses, we can avoid mental health challenges from escalating into long-term conditions in most cases,” he said.If emotional distress persists and children show signs of intense hopelessness, social withdrawal, being overwhelmed, self-harm tendencies or thoughts despite support from parents or caregivers, Dr Arman encouraged parents to seek professional help.Acknowledging the shortage of mental health professionals, especially those specializing in supporting children, he said community stakeholders - parents, teachers, caregivers, social workers and others – need to be equipped with mental health skills and tools.“This has to go beyond general awareness to provide emotional support, assess needs and refer to formal resources if needed. In most cases, early interventions can prevent mental health conditions in the future.\"In the case of counselling, Dr Arman said there needs to be more of a focus on child-centred creative, expressive and play therapies in professional help, in addition to online support like Malaysia’s only child-dedicated helpline during the Covid-19 crisis, Buddy Bear, in helping children handle emotions and coping skills.“This is because children communicate differently than adults. This means we need to provide a range of services catering to children - psychosocial helplines, online platforms, peer support groups and professional help from counsellors and psychologists.“The bottom line is we need more mental health professionals specialising in supporting children,” he said, adding that inclusive access to mental health services is even more important for the B40 group and rural communities.According to data from 2018, there were 410 psychiatrists in our country with a national average of 1.27 psychiatrists per 100,000 population, which is much lower than the WHO's recommended ratio of one psychiatrist per 10,000 population.Dr Arman noted that SOLS Health-Thrive Well has an ongoing programme called Keluarga Akrab Mencapai Impian (KAMI)m which work with PPR communities to engage children and parents at the community level in preventing escalation of mental health challenges, improving relationships and developing emotional resilience.“SOLS Health-Thrive Well, with the support of Yayasan Hasanah and Ministry of Finance, is also offering the Jom Sembang project providing subsidised mental health care, particularly for B40 communities, including children,” he said.An English teacher at a school in Jerantut, who only wanted to be known as Farhan, said students, especially SPM candidates in the school he teaches in, were having a hard time coping with online learning due to poor internet connectivity.“We could only conduct lessons via WhatsApp where I would send pictures and voice note to explain the lesson.“Even then, only a few students would respond to the lessons and out of 20 children, only around four students would participate in the lessons and they are usually the same person,” he said.Farhan also said the students reported facing a lack of motivation, were preoccupied with housework or caring for their younger siblings, as well as a lack of supervision from parents.“When they return to physical classes, we will need to teach them from scratch. It was particularly challenging for SPM candidates who needed to catch up.“The higher-ups often push teachers to use Google Meet and advanced online learning tools but often neglect the accessibility of students in rural areas.“The fact is, there are many children who are left behind in their studies, face difficulties in online learning, as well as stress and isolation during the pandemic and this will definitely affect their future plans and to an extent,their emotional and mental health” he said.Those in need of help can contact Befrienders at befrienders.org.my/centre-in-malaysia or call 03-7627 2929; Talian Kasih at 15999 (24 hours); and Lifeline (Mandarin) at 03-4265 7995.Story: Diyana PfordtenIllustrations: Foo Chern HwanEditing: Razak AhmadVisualisation: Sim Leoi LeoiTOPBuilt with Shorthand\n",

      "TOUGH times call for strong characters, especially if you are a teacher trying to educate students living in hard-to-reach areas during a pandemic.Though schools had to close when the movement control order (MCO) began, education was not brought to a halt.It is easy for a teacher to teach when the conditions are ideal - the classroom is comfortable, there are enough tables and chairs, every student has a book, stationery and can they see the board clearly.But in rural schools, more often than not, the situation is far from ideal. Little, if at all, is readily available.The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) secretary-general Harry Tan said it was passion and responsibility that drove these teachers to do everything within their power to carry out their duty.With the closure of schools, teachers had to get creative and find novel ways to deliver their lesson modules to their students, he told The Star.Some of those who taught in the interiors would travel by jeep, boat and foot to reach their students at their homes to give modules and learning packs.Others would brave bad weather to personally hand deliver assignments to their charges.Click on the icon on the pictures below to view each teacher's storyEven though these were not as effective to teach compared to face-to-face learning, these teachers believed that this would be enough to keep the students from missing out.Sabah Teachers' Union (STU Sabah) vice-president Susan Atau said online learning was a “huge challenge” for her and her rural students last year.She said her students did not have any digital devices and, coupled with an “extremely hopeless” Internet connection, she could not finish the syllabus in time.To help those without any means of learning virtually, Susan printed notes and modules that was distributed to her students.“Tender loving care is what drives me and all other teachers to do this for our students, ” she added.Educationist Datuk N. Siva Subramaniam said these teachers deserved to be honoured for the great lengths they went through.“While we recognise the sacrifices and contribution of these teachers, we must never forget that they too have families to take care of, ” added the former NUTP secretary-general, Cuepacs president and human rights commissioner.He said the nation owes its development to the dedication of these teachers who would be based in schools miles away from their families.Some, he added, would even be placed in schools without basic amenities.Based on data from the Education Ministry, there are 671 schools located in rural areas in Malaysia. The majority being in Sabah (285) and Sarawak (330).This is out of more than 10,000 schools in the country.Unsurprisingly there are no rural schools in the federal territories - Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan.Though nothing much can be done about the locality of these schools, there is concern that the students here are once again going to be badly affected when home-based teaching and learning (PdPR) makes a comeback after the Hari Raya holidays.“I think that urban schools would be fine conducting PdPR but the rural schools will have problems, ” said Subramaniam.However, he pointed out that all teachers faced problems implementing PdPR as they were not trained to teach in that manner.He added that the government should quickly provide proper laptops and a mobile data plan to these teachers to enable them to conduct, not just PdPR, but also prepare modules to be sent to their students again.Universiti Utara Malaysia School of Education senior lecturer Dr Muhammad Noor Abdul Aziz said teachers are struggling to make learning happen for their charges.\"Given that Malaysian learners are divided into two categories - urban and rural – issues like Internet connection, possession of gadgets, and continuous learning support seem to be a major hindrance among learners in rural areas while their counterparts in the urban area are burdened with homework.\"Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The employment disparity between young men and women in the country is alarming.More young Malaysian women are eager to join the workforce, have clearer career goals, and are more academically qualified, but they face higher unemployment rates.This worrying trend was identified in a study by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute titled “Unemployment among Malaysia’s Youth: Structural Trends and Current Challenges”, authored by its senior fellow and Malaysia Studies Programme co-coordinator Lee Hwok Aun.The paper, which was published on June 18,2020, addresses several factors affecting youth unemployment, and substantial gender disparity was one of them.While diverse reasons affect employment opportunities among young Malaysian women, various bodies and non-governmental organisations say marriage-related reasons and cultural aspects play a vital role.Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) executive director Shamsuddin Bardan said some women stop working after marriage.They cite reasons that include family responsibilities, such as having to look after their children and aged parents, he added.“Even after their children no longer require their mother to look after them or their parents have passed on, some women still choose not to rejoin the job market.“This is unlike Japan and South Korea, where women who stopped working due to similar reasons rejoin the workforce once their family-related responsibilities are reduced.“Despite the government’s incentive of tax exemptions for women returning to work after a career break, the take-up rate is low, ” he said.Creating a gender-diverse and inclusive workplace, Shamsuddin added, is a leadership matter.It must be a key component in employers’ policies and mission statements, as well as being demonstrated through actions.Gender biases must be managed through open dialogues and workplace campaigns as well, he said.“Women undoubtedly face more biases from both men and women themselves, explicitly and implicitly.“Unconscious bias is a result of ingrained cultural conditioning where women are not considered as valuable to the workforce, and they are seen as not very committed to the job or the organisation because of family responsibilities and conflicts.“Women might not be as forthcoming in expressing their discontent and their expectations from the employers as they are socially conditioned to undervalue themselves, ” he added.Moving forward, Shamsuddin said the female participation rate in the workforce could be pushed to higher rates, reaching beyond 60% of the LFP (labour force participation).Flexible working hours and work arrangements, work-life balance policies, and remote working are among the policies that could be implemented to encourage more women to work.“The private sector must embrace family-friendly policies and gender diversity in their workforce to boost women’s participation rate.“Employers who actively encourage, nurture and foster women in leadership roles also encourage more women into their workforce, ” he said.All Women's Action Society (Awam) information and communications officer Tan Chia Ee said the trend showing greater progress in closing the gender gap in educational attainment but less in economic participation is a global phenomenon.Occupational segregation could also explain the gender gap in economic participation, she added.“Women tend to concentrate in sectors such as retail, hospitality and care work while being underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), both in universities and in the job market.“This is due to not only longstanding stereotypes surrounding women’s suitability in STEM careers but also having few role models and access to academic support that can boost their interest, motivation and confidence in entering STEM.“Labour market disruption due to Covid-19 exacerbates the gender gap in employment, as women are retrenched due to the destruction of sectors where they predominate, while female talent influx and/or rate of transitioning into STEM remains low, ” she said, adding that women still encounter substantial structural barriers to more productive employment.Women still face strong conventional societal expectations to be homemakers and caregivers, while men are still expected to be family breadwinners.This social norm, she said, can shape biases surrounding women’s suitability for work.In a survey conducted on Malaysian women, Tan said 47% of the 1,010 respondents were asked about their marital status during a job interview, 22% were asked about their ability to perform certain tasks as a woman, 15% were asked about their plans to have children, and 13% were asked if they would require a long maternity leave if they got pregnant.Such questions constitute gender-based discrimination and can directly affect employment outcomes, she stressed.To enable gender parity in employment, she said changes in pre-existing unequal gender power are necessary and the public must play its part.This could be achieved through a multi-pronged strategy involving education, awareness-raising and incentives.Solutions, too, must be viewed from a public policy angle and public awareness on gender equality needs to be increased.“The media also has a role to play in challenging social norms that perpetuate gender inequality.“By promoting sexist perceptions and interpretations, the media can reinforce existing patriarchal power relations, not only making it more difficult to challenge the gender inequality status quo, but also making physical and online spaces less safe for women.“By challenging patriarchal and actively shaping gender-equal public narratives in everyday media, substantial differences can be made in terms of creating a culture that supports gender equality, ” added Tan.Universiti Sains Malaysia Centre for Research on Women and Gender director Prof Dr Noraida Endut has 25 years of experience researching gender issues.The trend according to the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute study, she said, is not necessarily more alarming than before, but she described it as frustrating.“There is a lack of progress and even with progress, it is incremental and takes so much time.“In Malaysia, the LFP rate for women has always been low compared to men.“Only in the last five years or so has the overall LFP surpassed 50%, ” she explained.A study commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme in 2013, she said, showed that the four main reasons women don’t work or stop working include looking after their children, leaving after getting married, leaving upon their husband’s request, and supporting their husband's career growth.“Among the women who have worked before and are now unemployed, about 57% said they want to work but had to stop for various reasons and among the women who have never worked before, 43% said they would like to work.“Therefore, we can see that women end up not working because they had to give up their careers or had to give up seeking employment to fulfil their expected roles as mothers and wives... it's because they are women, ” she said.Prof Noraida stressed that there must be clear policies at workplaces to facilitate a balance between work and family.This would allow for improved gender division of labour at home and at work, allowing more women to return to their workplaces.“These policies include maternity protection that extends to both pre- and post-natal periods where women are given temporary reliefs from some work during their pregnancy, ” she said.In addition, there should also be measures that could include special parking for pregnant women, flexible work arrangements, and an ability to take time off to go for check-ups without sacrificing annual leave.Other moves could include providing safe and accessible lactation rooms, time off to use lactation rooms, and time off to look after sick children for both female and male employees.“A gender equality policy is also important to ensure the organisation observes and develops a gender-equal and non-discriminatory practice.“This includes, for example, prohibiting the practice of asking female candidates about her ability to execute her duties if she is a mother or about her potentially getting pregnant, ” added Prof Noraida.A sexual harassment policy and mechanism is also important because sexual harassment, she said, is a form of gender-based violence that hinders women’s access and opportunity to enjoy their rights at work.“It often causes women to be unfairly treated in their promotion or to be constructively dismissed.”Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities Centre for Research in Media and Communication Assoc Prof Dr Jamaluddin Aziz said the way forward is to depoliticise employment.He said the government, too, should step in to continue providing support systems that would facilitate women empowerment.Women empowerment projects, he said, must be carried out by the right groups and their efficiency must be tested and proven.“There are many factors that contribute to this trend.“Usually, these factors are when economic opportunities, level of literacy and cultural practices intersect with gender.“Therefore, gender is a valid lens from which this trend can be interpreted.“For instance, although a reasonable number of economic opportunities for women have been provided by the government, cultural practices, political interference, and level of literacy may hinder their participation, ” he explained.He said in some instances, although financial aid is given specifically to women to help with their businesses, some register for the benefit of their husbands.There are also those who register their businesses under their husbands’ names.“These are examples of issues at the operational level, while it is the fundamental levels that need more attention – such as the gender structure in our culture as it is often manifested in the way we assign value to men and women, and boys and girls.”Malaysia must move from this mentality and approach, he stressed.Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Countries around the world are exploring ways to show proof of an individual's Covid-19 immunity in order to allow travel and other easing of social restrictions.Several countries have initiated travel passports, which are Covid-19 vaccine certificates or any physical or digital document that would prove you've received both doses (or one dose for certain vaccines) of any of the available Covid-19 vaccines.In some countries, vaccine certificates can also be issued to those who have recently tested negative for Covid-19 or have built immunity against it after having been infected.All this would allow citizens to travel among participating countries or be granted exemptions to certain Covid-19 restrictions in their own country.A recent survey by market research firm Ipsos shows that more than three-quarters of adults surveyed (78%) across 28 countries agree that Covid-19 vaccine passports should be required of travellers entering their country.In comparison to the size of the majority in other countries polled, Malaysians were largely more supportive of having vaccine passports or similar health certificates in order to allow travellers to enter the country (92%).The survey was conducted from March 26 to April 9 with adults from the age of 16 to 75 in 28 countries.The findings show that Malaysians were also highly optimistic that vaccine passports will be widely used by the end of the year.\"They strongly believe that this will make travel and large events safe.\"Japan, host country of 2021 Olympics, and the United States, which has rolled out a vaccination programme efficiently, are not as optimistic as Malaysia,\" Ipsos said in a statement.Its managing director Arun Menon noted that countries across the world are progressing through their vaccination phases, but some are still facing larger surges or second or third waves of the pandemic.\"The Malaysian public widely supports the requirement of vaccine certificates to enter the country and access large venues.\"As we cross a year of living with Covid-19, the Malaysian public is looking for ways in which they can get back to normal, even if that requires carrying or mandating vaccine passports or similar health certificates,\" he said.Travel industry players are also hopeful that travel passports will help revive their battered industry.Travel passports or proof of vaccination can be in the form of a physical card, a piece of paper with a QR code, or most often, a mobile app.However, there is still no clear universal standard for vaccine certificates for all countries.The World Health Organisation has also outlined considerations regarding immunity passports due to the shortage of or unequal access to vaccines in many countries.Health experts in Malaysia advise caution on introducing travel passports too soon amid concerns of new Covid-19 variants emerging, vaccine effectiveness and the feasibility as well as fairness of establishing such a system.Despite that, many countries have already started initiating travel bubbles and vaccine passports among other selected countries.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised against travelling to certain parts of the world, and the US State Department's travel advisory outlines the level of Covid-19 risks in countries based on the spread of the Covid-19 virus and number of cases.Only 30 destinations in the world are classified under Level 1 in the travel advisory, which indicates a low risk of Covid-19. These include countries like Brunei, China, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand and Laos.CDC guidelines also noted that once fully vaccinated – defined as two weeks after taking the final dose – it is safe to meet indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks or keeping a distance.Some countries have also used vaccine certificates to return to some measure of normalcy with regard to social activities, such as allowing those with Covid-19 immunity to access mass gatherings, indoor venues and events -- such as stadiums, swimming pools, restaurants, gyms, theatres, concerts, hotels and also pilgrimage sites.However, the CDC guidelines advised those going to medium and large gatherings to take precautions by practising physical distancing and wearing a mask regardless of attendees' vaccination status.The Malaysian government suggested in early April that individuals who have completed two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine may be allowed to travel interstate or even abroad, as well as be exempted from certain Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SOPs).To date, no official decision has been made.The country is still in negotiations with international parties including Asean countries and the European Union on the need for a mutually recognised vaccine passport to resume travel among the partner states.\n",

      "From the Star Photo AlbumCapturing An Iconic Lightning StrikeBy Razak AhmadIN the blink of an eye, a giant spark of electricity shot down from the heavens and struck Putrajaya at 4.07pm on April 28, 2005.Nature offers a bounty of stunning images but few as fleeting, elusive and hard to capture in a photograph as lightning.Raja Faisal Hishan’s shot of that bolt of lightning as it hit the dome of the Prime Minister’s Office complex made the front page of The Star and won local and international accolades.The iconic image kicks off a series of interactive articles that aims to showcase some of the many stunning shots that The Star’s photographers have snapped over the years.Armed with 28 years of experience behind the lens, Raja Faisal recalls how he managed to catch lightning that stormy day 16 years ago.He was in the vicinity of the Prime Minister’s office for an interview assignment.Location of the Prime Minister's Office in PutrajayaPlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time00:12Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenThe sky, darkened by heavy clouds, was ablaze with lightning streaks signaling an impending thunderstorm.“I thought to myself, I need to capture this lightning.”It began to rain heavily, forcing him to seek shelter in his car as he tried to figure out how to get his shot.  He had to think fast.For safety, he decided to shoot from inside his car. He drove to a spot across the Prime Minister’s office complex and rolled down the window.He chose a wide angle 17-35mm lens as he didn’t know where exactly the lightning would strike.A lightning streak occurs in a fraction of a second, so he adjusted his Canon Mark 111 camera shutter speed to a high setting of 1/1250 sec and waited.And then it happened.There was a flash of light. He pressed the shutter button, capturing a machine gun rapid eight frames per second.Of the dozen frames he took; the lightning was present in four.He felt disappointed but decided to pack up and leave, rather than stay longer and raise the risk of getting struck.Checking his images after he got home, he realised he had done it.One of the four shots showed a perfect lightning strike on the dome of the Perdana Putra building.Photographer Raja Faisal explaining step by step how he captured the lightning videoPlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time04:34Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenThe photo made the front page of The Star on April 30 that year.The image won him first prize at the 2006 Malaysian Press Institute Award in the Media Photo News, beating over 61 other entries.It also won earned him the Silver Award in the Spot News category of the Asia Media Awards 2006 organised by Ifra, the world’s leading association for newspaper and media publishing.The awards were open to media organisations throughout Asia, with Raja Faisal the first winner from Malaysia.Raja Faisal winning the Silver Award during the Asia Media Awards 2006While photographing a fleeting flash of lightning is challenging, lightning itself is no stranger to many parts of Malaysia.The Klang Valley reportedly has the third highest number of lightning strikes in the world.Last year, the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang had a whopping 341 days with lightning.It was the highest for 2020 based on records of the Malaysian Meteorological Department’s 42 main meteorological stations.Subang meanwhile holds the record for the area with the highest ever number of days with lightning ever recorded.According to MetMalaysia’s figures, there were 362 days with lightning in Subang in 1987.Put another way, there were only three days in 1987 when the highly urbanised city in Selangor’s Petaling district did not see lightning.PlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time01:16Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenAccording to MetMalaysia, the highest amount of lightning is seen during the country’s inter-monsoon periods between April to May and October.Lightning is also frequent between June and September during the south-west monsoon.The north-east monsoon from December to March however sees relatively fewer incidences of lightning.Story: Razak AhmadPhotograph: Raja Faisal HishanAnimation: Nor Shalina Abdul Samad and Shaiful Rizwan Mohd AzharVisualisation: Sim Leoi LeoiTOPBuilt with Shorthand\n",

      "Myanmar at a Crossroadsby MAZWIN NIK ANIS and JOSEPH KAOS, JRAP PhotoWHEN the 10 members of Asean meet for a special summit in Jakarta today, the most urgent and immediate task at hand is to resolve the political crisis in Myanmar, which has so far seen over 700 people killed in protests across the country.The fact that the summit, the first physical meeting amidst a pandemic, is taking place speaks volume of the urgent matter at hand and will see the attendance of heads of government, except for Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan o-cha who has confirmed that he will be skipping the meet.Thailand will instead be represented by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai.If the head of Myanmar’s military government, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, does indeed show up for the meet, this will be his first known foreign trip since the junta's coup on Feb 1.Protesters pour water in an attempt to diminish the effects of tear gas during a crackdown by security forces on a demonstration against the military coup in Yangon's Thaketa township on March 19, 2021. (Photo by STR / AFP)The Asean leaders' meeting in Jakarta, which was called by Indonesia, will be chaired by Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah as the 2021 Asean chair.Also present will be Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.Muhyiddin, said Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein, had received a special invitation letter from Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah to attend the meet on April 17.“The Prime Minister has formally responded to the letter on April 19 that he will be attending the meeting,\" he told reporters during a buka puasa event at Wisma Putra on April 20.On Feb 5, Muhyiddin and Indonesian president Joko “Jokowi” Widodo had said that they were seeking a special meeting of the South-East Asian nations to discuss the situation in Myanmar.Singapore is also in support of the proposal.During the summit, coincidentally, Min is expected to sit next to Muhyiddin.As the country harbouring a large number of refugees from Myanmar - Rohingya from the conflict-ridden Rakhine State, as well as those of the Chin ethnic group, among others - Malaysia is certainly keen to see the current political crisis resolved as peacefully and as quickly as possible.This is particularly so when there is now a real fear of Myanmar turning into another \"Syria\", a country wracked by civil war since 2011.  \"There are clear echoes of Syria in 2011,\" United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has warned on April 14.On Sept 26 last year, as Malaysia grapples with the economic spillover from the Covid-19 pandemic, Muhyiddin has told the United Nations that as a developing nation coping with the cost of managing and providing protection to nearly 180,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers in the country - 86% of them from Myanmar - its resources are being stretched thin.Read more: Find moral courage, political will to do what's right, Muhyiddin tells UNPrime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. - BernamaMalaysia and Asean members will surely not want the present conflict in Myanmar to worsen and result in an even worse flood of refugees.Thailand, Myanmar's neighbour on the south, is already having to face some 2,000 refugees from the ethnic Karen minority massing along its border following air strikes by the junta.Myanmar, the largest country on mainland south-east asia with a population of 54 million people comprising 135 recognised ethnic groups, has long been engrossed in ethnic strife and is engaged in ongoing civil wars with various armed factions within the country, such as the Shan state army near the Thai border.Read more: Worried about Myanmar’s futureA Myanmar national in Malaysia, Than Phe Lay, says they will make their feelings heard via online protests.It was only recently - before the Feb 1 coup - that the country has seen relative peace under some semblance of democratic rule and trade with its neighbours flourish.But the killing of protesters in street demonstrations by the military junta has led to some ethnic armed factions vowing not to stand by and do nothing should this continue.Malaysia, said Hishammuddin, remains firm in its stance that the violence in Myanmar must end and that political detainees must be released immediately.  “We will reiterate Malaysia’s stance on the Myanmar situation in which the violence in the country must cease immediately.“Secondly, all political leaders in Myanmar must be released immediately.Read more: Malaysia calls for Suu Kyi’s releaseForeign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein. - MOHD SAHAR“Thirdly, Myanmar must agree to receive representatives from the Asean chair, which is Brunei, or from the Asean secretariat to help the country return to normalcy,” he stressed.From the three-finger salute, an inspiration from the dystopian novel Hunger Games, to painted Easter eggs, graffiti, and popular memes, the people in Myanmar are taking their fight for democracy to the Internet.The Internet has become as important - and certainly less risky- a frontline as the streets for protesters in the country.Brought on up a diet of social media feed, this Internet-savvy generation of protesters are making sure that when they do turn up for their rallies, they are colourful, unusual and Instagram-worthy to catch the world's spotlight and make sure that their fight is not forgotten.And despite the shutdown of Internet access by the military, they are making sure to flood social media with memes, ranging from Pepe the Frog to NFSW mottoess, mostly in English.This photo taken and received courtesy of an anonymous source on April 8, 2021, shows shoes being displayed with flowers in Mandalay, as part of the \"Marching Shoes Strike\" called on social media.

RAYMOND OOI/ The StarIn fact, while many Western countries sought to levy sanctions and condemn Myanmar during Aung Sang Suu Kyi's house arrest in the 1990s and early 2000s, Malaysia has worked, through diplomatic overtures via Asean, for her eventual release, which subsequently, ushered in democratic rule in Myanmar.Aung Sang Suu Kyi is now back under house arrest and facing various charges, including corruption, while other senior leaders of the National League of Democracy (NLD), which won overwhelmingly in a general election declared void by the junta, are in detention and have their offices ransacked.The democratic progress of the recent past years is now in danger of coming undone.

      "PETALING JAYA: Ahead of Hari Raya Aidilfitri next month, many Malaysians are wondering whether they would be allowed to travel across state lines to celebrate the festival in their hometowns amid the Covid-19 pandemic.On Thursday (April 15), Health Minister Datuk Dr Adham Baba said that his ministry had proposed a postponement in allowing interstate travel for Aidilfitri celebrations as the Covid-19 transmission rate is still at a worrying level.The ministry had earlier said that it would do a risk assessment study to determine if it is safe to allow interstate travel for Aidilfitri, or whether doing so would lead to another surge of Covid-19 infections.For context, on March 5 the government allowed travel across districts while interstate movement remained restricted.The Star analysed the Health Ministry’s Covid-19 figures from March 1 to April 14 to get a clearer picture on whether things have been improving.What does the data show?One of the things health authorities and experts measure when trying to find out where things are headed is the infection’s reproduction number, called R0 (pronounced as “R naught”).The R value refers to the number of people that a person who has the coronavirus will infect.If the R value is 1 for example, it means that on average, one infected person will spread Covid-19 to one other individual.An R value higher than 1 means that the number of cases will increase.However, if the R value goes down, the disease will eventually stop spreading as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.To calculate the reproduction number, experts use data such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time to estimate how easily the virus is spreading.Since March 1, the daily R value for Malaysia as released by the Health Ministry has climbed to more than 1:Community clusters on the riseOf late there has been an apparent increase in the number of infections due in part to a failure to follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) during social activities and gatherings.In Terengganu, for example, mengeteh or ngeteh – having coffee or tea with friends in restaurants or stalls after subuh (dawn) prayers in mosques or surau – was one factor behind the emergence of a Covid-19 cluster in Besut.Last month, Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah reminded Sarawakians to avoid social gatherings and comply with the Covid-19 SOP.He said the number of cases was high of late because of the failure of some people to adhere to the SOP, particularly at social gatherings.\"Several clusters have emerged from social gatherings, where those affected were involved in funerals, weddings, gambling or cock-fighting activities.\"These social activities sometimes involve inter-district travel and movement from red zones to other zones, causing the disease to spread,\" he said at the state disaster management committee's briefing in Kuching on March 1.Often, such cases will involve what the Health Ministry classifies as community clusters.According to the ministry’s background description of the clusters, some were linked to funerals, celebrations, social gatherings and weddings.The remaining community clusters were related to index cases detected during hospital admission and procedure screening, pre-employment screening, pre-interstate travel screening as well as screenings of symptomatic individuals.The ministry's figures show that of the 347 new Covid-19 clusters that emerged from March 1 to April 14, 83 (23.9%) were classified as community clusters, making them the second biggest type of cluster behind workplace clusters, which recorded a figure of 236 (68%).A likely reason why workplace clusters dominate is the government’s decision to make it mandatory for all foreign workers to undergo screening.However, authorities experts have repeatedly warned about the threat that is also posed by infections within the community.In deciding whether it will be okay for Malaysians to travel to their hometowns for Hari Raya Aidilfitri, the Health Ministry has said that its risk assessment would be based on six factors:What the experts sayUniversiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman said interstate travel for the purpose of balik kampung should not be allowed until most of the vulnerable groups of the population have received their vaccinations.\"We have observed, based on recent data from the Health Ministry, that 69% of deaths related to Covid-19 involve those who are 60 years old and above, and 89% of them have underlying health conditions.\"If active and new cases are within one to two digits, and most of our vulnerable group (the elderly and those with comorbidities) have received their vaccines, only then should interstate travel for the country be allowed,\" she said.She urged the public to continue to take precautions, adding that decisions should be made to avoid the possibility of a fourth wave of infections.\"The government should continue current strategies on managing the outbreak, enforcement of regulations under Act 342, and promoting the vaccines.\"At the same time, all of us in the community should follow all those procedures, comply with the SOP and sign up for the vaccine,\" said Dr Malina.Universiti Putra Malaysia's consultant clinical microbiologist Prof Dr Zamberi Sekawi said that until the number of cases is reduced significantly and herd immunity is achieved, where at least 80% of the population is vaccinated, it is not yet safe for the public to travel freely or live a \"normal life\".\"With the current figures, chances are we won't be able to travel interstate for Hari Raya.\"Once you open up the borders, the number of cases will surely go up and spread to states where there are few cases,\" he said.Dr Zamberi said if the number of cases is not kept to a low figure, the country risks facing deadlier mutations of the coronavirus.\"Our best option now is to get as many people vaccinated,\" he said.He said the government can encourage more people to get vaccinated by giving special allowance to social activities for those who have received the vaccine, such as being able to gather without wearing masks.Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs senior fellow Dr Carmelo Ferlito, meanwhile, believes that movement controls such as the travel ban should be implemented in a targeted approach instead of having generalised policies.He said policies and solutions should be drafted to keep those at risk safe and protected, such as by restricting those liable to severe Covid-19 infections from traveling and to remain confined, while ensuring they have access to ad hoc support.\"We should allow the healthy part of the population to conduct a normal life, eventually get infected and go through the illness, developing immunity,\" he said, adding that for this segment of the population, limitations on the number of people per gathering, scientifically decided on a square metre basis of available space, is sufficient.He added that with such an approach, a lot of money could be saved in economic stimuli and instead be invested in developing an effective long-term treatment, which is beyond the use of Covid-19 vaccines.\"We have lost more than one year and resources in not trying to develop a treatment,\" he said.He highlighted that the percentage of total mortality from the total number of Covid-19 cases in the country has been on a constant downward trend since September and is currently at 0.37%, a relatively low figure when compared to other countries.He added that the mortality rate was also low in comparison to other illnesses or fatalities due to road accidents.\"At the same time, some scientific articles, like a recent one from Science, pointed out that our main concern cannot be simply to limit transmissions.\"In fact, by limiting transmissions we can prolong the duration of the pandemic to 10 years, never allowing it to become endemic,\" he said, arguing that interstate travel ban would already be safe if a targeted strategy was implemented.He said that data on death distribution by age groups and with comorbidities can help the government determine who are most at risk, and thus implement policies to protect them.\"It is also good to have access to the distribution of Covid-19 tests such as the ratio between tests and cases in places like workplaces and others,\" he said.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Unhealthy lifestyles are killing more and more Malaysians, with deaths linked to ailments such as heart and cererbrovascular diseases nearly doubling from 2000 to 2017.This is among the findings of an analysis done by The Star based on Statistics Department figures on the causes of deaths in the country since the year 2000.Commenting on the findings, health experts said the trend underscores why it is vital for Malaysians to adopt a healthy lifestyle through balanced diets, regular exercises and other good habits as these will help prevent health conditions that are killing a growing number of us each year.According to the department’s figures, heart diseases, pneumonia and cerebrovascular diseases are, in order, the top three causes of deaths in the country.Deaths due to ischaemic heart disease saw a nearly two-fold (197%) increase in Malaysia in 2017 compared to 2000.In comparison, the population of Malaysia over the same period only grew by 36%, from 23.49 million in 2000 to 32.02 million in 2017.Ishchaemic heart disease, which is also a leading cause of death in many other countries, happens when arteries cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart, causing a heart attack.In Malaysia, it mainly affects people aged between 41 and 59 years old, as well as those 60 years old and above, especially in urban areas.About 15% of the 109,164 medically certified deaths in 2019 was caused by ischaemic heart disease, followed by pneumonia (12.2%) and cerebrovascular disease (8%).Ischaemic heart disease was the primary cause of death among males, with men making up 69.4% of those who died from the disease, while pneumonia was the top cause of death for females.The number of deaths from cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs), a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, increased by 112% in 2017 compared to 2000.According to the World Health Organisation, an estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths.\"Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke.\"Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies,\" it said.Medical Practitioners Coalition Association of Malaysia president Dr Raj Kumar Maharajah said the steady increase in deaths caused by non-communicable diseases is due to unhealthy lifestyles.“Everyone feels that the responsibility for their health rests with their family doctor or the Health Ministry. People must realise that they are responsible for their own health and wellbeing.“Obesity rates, for instance, have skyrocketed and we are now the most obese nation in South-East Asia, ” he said.He also added that people in recent years are choosing to “self-medicate” from information they find on the Internet, especially over the last decade.“Many a time, patients search their symptoms on the Internet and they get their medication directly from the pharmacy or traditional medicine men -- bypassing their general practitioners.“This can cause irreversible damage to their bodies and by the time they go to the doctors and get their problems detected, the damage has already been done, ” he said.Dr Raj Kumar suggested that for patients to lead healthier lifestyles to prevent cerebrovascular diseases or ischaemic heart diseases, they must have a dedicated family doctor to continuously monitor their health.“With the Internet, there is too much information from unreliable sources. Patients must not self-medicate or take supplements without checking with their doctors.“Children in schools should be taught to eat good food, exercise regularly and sleep well. This has to be ingrained in school as it will become a habit to lead healthy lifestyles, ” he said.Malaysian Medical Association president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity caused by poor lifestyle habits can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases as well as pneumonia.Commenting on men being more susceptible to heart diseases compared to women, Dr Subramanian said the higher risk among men can be due to poor lifestyle choices.\"Unhealthy eating, smoking and alcoholism is known to be higher among men and this can be contributing factors,\" he said.Dr Subramaniam encouraged lifestyle adjustments to reduce the risk of developing these medical conditions.\"It is also important that people go for scheduled medical checkups with their general practitioners to be up to date on their health status,\" he said.Meanwhile, deaths caused by pneumonia recorded the largest increase of 579% or 10,543 more deaths in 2017 compared to 2000 and is the leading cause of death for women.\"Pneumonia is a condition where the lungs are infected because its smallest units, the sacs of alveoli, are filled with inflammatory fluid or purulent discharge (pus), which would lead to difficulty in breathing, compromised gas exchange, and reduce oxygen intake by the individual,\" said Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman.Dr Malina said that the disease is mainly caused by micro-organisms like viruses, bacteria, fungi, and it is associated with underlying individual health status such as immune status, any chronic illness or pre-existing lung disorder, and socio-environmental factors such as pollutants, ventilation, crowding, and others.She believes that the large hike in the number of deaths related to pneumonia over the years may be due to improved documentation and classification, as well as medical diagnosis.\"There may be some changes in case definition for cause of death for the purpose of reporting.\"In early 2000, some of those cases with infection were being classified as septicemia,\" she said.Septicemia is a bloodstream infection that occurs when a bacterial infection, which happens elsewhere in the body, enters the bloodstream.The number of deaths caused by septicemia had indeed decreased in 2015 and did not garner notable increase thereafter.\"In general, pneumonia is treatable and preventable. There are some vaccines against certain infections,\" said Dr Malina, adding that those with immunity problems such as the young or elderly with health complications, may face more severe complications if infected with the disease.The World Health Organisation estimates that pneumonia kills an estimated 1.4 million children under the age of five every year.The disease is also the third leading cause of death for children under five.Dr Malina said the government, through the Health Ministry, allocated a specific budget for children's vaccination programmes and revised the type of vaccines and the vaccination schedule for children in 2020.\"At the current stage, those vaccines are available in all health clinics in our country,\" she said.Starting Dec 1,2020, the country kicked off the national pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) programme that allows children born from Jan 1,2020, onwards to be entitled to free pneumococcal vaccine jabs at the Health Ministry’s health clinics.The vaccine is aimed at preventing bacterial infections of streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus, which can cause diseases such as pneumonia, sinusitis, middle ear infection (otitis media), meningitis and septicemia.\"Every parent should get their children vaccinated to prevent severe cases of pneumonia that can cause death,\" she said.\n",

      "THE Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to seriously look at the way we live our lives and more importantly at how we consume food.As many people lost their jobs due to the pandemic, there are those who resorted to growing their own organic vegetables at home naturally, with some hard work.This is to offset paying a huge price for imported organic vegetables.“When we look at the organic agriculture industry in Malaysia, we find that we import a huge percentage of organic food, which doesn’t make sense because we are a farming country at the heart of it, ” said Petaling Jaya-based The Urban Farm director Brendan Lee.He said there was not much education in Malaysia when it came to organic and non-organic vegetables.“All this importing causes such a huge price discrepancy too. Organic vegetables can cost double or triple the price of non-organic vegetables, ” he explained.Brendan opined that we often do not think about the source of the vegetables, where it comes from and how it is grown.“Imported organic vegetables are expensive so people don’t see the need for it. And even if they do, many cannot afford to buy it.“It’s a shame, because when you look at other more developed countries, the difference between non-organic and organic vegetables is at 30%, which is very affordable.“That’s like US$3 (RM12.44) for non-organic and US$3.90 (RM16.17) for a head of organic lettuce in the US, while in Malaysia, it is RM3 for non-organic and RM7.50 for organic.”Brendan’s aquaponic farm was set up more than two years ago, and even then they were not the first.Aquaponic is a pesticide-free way of farming that combines aquaculture --- in this case growing fish --- and hydroponics which is growing plants without soil.The fish do most of the work, by eating and producing waste.The beneficial bacteria in the water converts the waste into nutrient-rich water and is fed to the soil-less plants.Brendan said there were more small and medium-size players coming into the farm-in-the-city game.“This is great, and it is not uncommon to source vegetables from other farms, so you will find that in this industry there is a lot of cross-buying and selling, ” added Brendan.Recently, Brendan started his second farm in Petaling Jaya Old Town, where he had built a fully indoor vertical farm.\"We are still utilising aquaponics as the method to grow our vegetables, but we have additional control over the environment with regards to temperature and daylight (through the use of LED grow lights), ” he said.This controlled environment allows him to grow many varieties of vegetables which are unable to tolerate the high temperature outdoors.Brendan, 27, grows many different varieties of kale (Curly kale and Siberian kale), lettuce (Lollo Bionda, butterhead, romaine), herbs (rocket, mint, sweet basil) and local favourites such as dwarf bok choy.According to him, vegetable prices customarily fluctuate depending on the weather.\"Excessive rain and flooding will cause prices of the produce to go up. Growing them indoors solves this issue,\" he said.He added that vertical farming also reduced the need to clear land for agricultural use.“By employing new technologies and systems, unused or abandoned urban areas can be revitalised and utilised for food production, ” he said.Over in Cheras, e-business student Sean Lee, 19, needed a hobby last year when the movement control order was first implemented.He had a lot of time on his hands when he was not attending his online university classes.More importantly, he was determined to find a solution to heal his father’s psoriasis.“My father can only eat organic vegetables.“The main problem is the fertiliser and pesticides used in (conventional) farming, and his immune system is working against him.“So, I decided to grow my own vegetables for him, ” said the teenager with a keen interest in aquaponic farming and who is the bubbly proprietor of E-Farm.Sean always had a love for rearing fish in aquariums, but did not like maintaining and cleaning the filtration system, which is why aquaponics worked for him.He started his aquaponic project with one fish tank, a makeshift filter and two vertical plant towers that had spinach, curly kale and bok choy.“Kale is rich in antioxidants, so I gave this to my father and his psoriasis healed a little, ” he said.He set out to start aquaponic farming on a corner lot house with a big garden that could fit a 92.9sq m greenhouse to grow 25 types of vegetables and herbs.It took two months and the help of many property agents to locate the ideal site to start his aquaponic farm, after scouting in Petaling Jaya, Subang Jaya and parts of Kuala Lumpur.As you step into the split-level greenhouse, the first thing you will notice is the pond full of healthy red tilapia.An automated feeder is stocked with fish pellets, and the fish are fed every three hours between 10am and 7pm.Sean said their fish pellets were custom-made to not contain any antibiotics or growth hormones.\"The fish are also fed vegetable scraps from unsold vegetables at the farm.\"Red tilapia are a common breed of fish used in aquaponic farming.“Patin and koi fish can also be used for aquaponic farming, ” he said.The oyster shells in the fish tank contain calcium and act as a buffer to maintain the optimum Ph level of 6.2 to 7 in the water.The aquaponic process starts with vegetable pellets that are fed to the fish and their waste produces ammonia. The waste is then pumped into the filtration system to remove the solids.The ammonia-filled water is pumped into the biotank, which is an “apartment for bacteria”, with a big surface area.“The bacteria will consume the ammonia (NH₃), and will change it into nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-). Nitrates are what plants need.“The ammonia and nitrite need to be at ‘0’ optimally, as both are poisonous to the fish.“The function of the biotank is to negate the ammonia and nitrite, ” Sean explained.The nitrate-rich water is pumped into the power system, where the plants absorb all the nutrients from the grow beds and multiple aisles of vertical trickle towers.The water from the tower will slowly make its way down into the pond system and from there it feeds the fish again.Sean grows vegetables such as bok choy (which have standard white or emerald green stems and come in a variety of species like Milky, King, Green Dynasty and Four Seasons); choy sum (Shangrila, King and Japan varieties), kale, watercrest, Oba or shiso leaf (Japanese mint), lettuce (green coral and butterhead), Okinawa spinach, Brazilian spinach and herbs such stevia, peppermint, spearmint, rosemary, mizuna and ensabi.He has 120 vertical towers with each holding 90 plants, totalling 10,800 plants overall.The eight grow beds underneath the towers are a space saver, he said.“Every inch is crucial for optimisation, ” he added.The grow bed uses clay balls, called hydroton or light expanded clay aggregate (LECA) which is a substitute for soil.Sean said the system only runs on one water pump which means their electricity bill was kept at a reasonable amount, averaging about RM500 a month while their water bill was RM15 monthly.“Suffice to say, this is a low cost way of growing vegetables, ” he said.Animation by Nor Shalina Abdul Samad and Shaiful Rizwan.Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden's Indo-Pacific policy chief said on Tuesday he was \"relatively confident\" a target for the production of a billion vaccine doses for the region by the end of 2022 would be met, despite the COVID-19 crisis in India, where they are due to be made.Asked at an event hosted by the Center for a New American Security think tank if he expected a delay in the four-nation plan, which was announced at the White House in March with great fanfare, Kurt Campbell said Washington had been in close consultation with India and others involved in the project.\"Obviously, this is an extremely difficult period for Indian friends. The United States has tried to stand with Delhi and to bring others, both in the private and public sector, to support them,\" he said.\"Our discussions with both our partners in the private sector, and also in government, suggest that we are - knock on wood - still on track for 2022.\"\"I think we're feeling relatively confident as we head in to 2022,\" he added, while stressing that across Asia and the world even countries that did well in handling the virus were facing outbreaks due to new strains.\"I think we understand, the only way to be effective, to counter this, is through vaccine diplomacy. We're trying to step that up more generally,\" he said.The so-called Quad grouping of the United States, India, Japan and Australia agreed at a March summit that Indian drugmaker Biological E Ltd would produce at least a billion vaccine doses by the end of 2022 that would go to Southeast Asian countries, elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific, and beyond.U.S. officials said that under the plan the United States and Japan would help Indian manufacturing of vaccines for U.S. drugmakers Novavax Inc and Johnson & Johnson.India, the world's largest vaccine producer, was subsequently hit by a catastrophic wave of infections and halted vaccine exports amid intense criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a domestic vaccine rollout that covered less than 5% of an estimated adult population of 950 million.Indian government sources told Reuters in May India was unlikely to resume major exports of vaccines until at least October. On Tuesday, Indian officials and health experts welcomed a government plan to give free shots to all adults, but cautioned that vaccinations must be accelerated to prevent new surges in infections.(Reporting by David Brunnstrom and Michael Martina in WashingtonEditing by Matthew Lewis)\n",

      "JOHOR BARU: For more than a year, a brown female dog faithfully accompanied frontliners on duty at the KM16 Jalan Kulai-Kota Tinggi roadblock, set up since the first movement control order in March last year.Taken by the mongrel’s calm and friendly nature, one of the policemen, Kpl Mohd Faidzul Ishak, named her “Jony”.For him and his colleagues Konst Hanif Farhan Mohd Norizan and Konst Mohd Syawalludin Moslim, Jony proved to be a valuable companion, especially through those cold and quiet graveyard shifts.“One day, she came out of the oil palm plantations nearby and came near our roadblock tent. She never entered the tent and would just sit close by and watch us work daily.“It became a routine and we would often feed her whatever food we had, such as chicken and rice, as she does not like eating dog food, ” Kpl Faidzul, 33, told The Star.“Her presence was a comfort for us, especially during our roadblock shifts from 4pm to midnight and from midnight to 8am. We would play chase with her and she kept us entertained.”He added that they always wore gloves when interacting with Jony.But things took a turn for the worse when the off-duty Kpl Faidzul received a call from a colleague at midnight on May 29, informing him that a wounded Jony was found in some bushes nearby, presumably injured from an accident.“My colleagues were too afraidto move her. Without a second thought, I called up Hanif Farhan and Syawalludin and we rushed to Jony’s aid.“My heart sank when I saw her in such a fragile state with injuries to her abdomen and legs.“All we could think of was saving our best friend, ” he said, adding that they wrapped her in a blanket and rushed her to the Kota Tinggi government veterinary clinic.“It was closed, so we knocked on the veterinarian’s house door for help. He informed us that government veterinary clinics do not perform surgery.“We ended up taking Jony back to our police quarters and poured some iodine on her wounds, ” he said.The following morning, the three policemen sent the wounded animal to a private veterinary clinic in Taman Kebun Teh.Despite severe spinal injuries, the veterinarian said he could save Jony’s leg but the operation would cost thousands of ringgit.The policemen agreed but faced another issue – a shortage of funds – so Kpl Faidzul reached out to social activist Kuan Chee Heng, better known as Uncle Kentang, for some donations.He said he did not expect Kuan to share their story on his Facebookor for Jony’s story to go viral, but felt touched by his help and the outpour of concern from Malaysians on social media.“Jony underwent her first surgery on June 1, which came up to more than RM2, 000. She is expected to undergo another surgery in about a week’s time as the veterinarian wanted to give her time to recover first.“We are now raising more funds to add to the initial donations in preparation for her second surgery, which is expected to cost more than RM2, 000 as well, ” he said, adding that he was also thankful for the discounts given by the veterinarian.Jony is now recuperating at his friend’s farm in Kota Tinggi, he said, adding that they used some of the donations from Uncle Kentang to build a comfortable cage for her.“I always educate my children to be caring towards animals. My wife has been quite concerned about Jony’s wellbeing too.“We hope Jony can recover and go back to being her bubbly and active self soon, ” Kpl Faidzul said.When contacted, Kuan said he was only trying to highlight the friendship between Jony and the policemen to spread some positive energy during these trying times.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: After witnessing her father’s unimaginable grief over the loss of his beloved wife to Covid-19 just two weeks after Hari Raya Aidilfitri, a woman is pleading with fellow Malaysians to keep battling the virus.Civil servant Siti Raudhah Md Yatim, 39, said her mother Hajah Saby Musa, 63, breathed her last after a week of treatment at the Kuala Lumpur Hospital.Siti Raudhah told mStar that it all started when her father came down with a fever on May 14, followed by her younger brother and mother two days later.All three of them lived in the same house in Sungai Buloh, Selangor.“On May 18, there was talk that someone at the mosque near my parents’ house had Covid-19 and that those who were at the mosque between May 10 and 14 had to go for a swab test.“My parents, my younger brother, my older sister and my brother-in-law did swab tests. All five of them tested positive, ” she said.On May 22, her parents and younger brother were taken to a quarantine centre but the next day, Siti Raudhah’s mother was transferred to the hospital as her blood oxygen level was low.Her mother had a history of hypertension, diabetes and minor stroke, she said.“Video calls were the only thing connecting my family at the time, ” she added.A few days after her mother’s transfer to the hospital, a doctor asked to see a family member to discuss her condition.“The doctor was honest and said my mother’s chance was 50-50, adding that if there was a younger patient, they would have to choose the younger patient as they would have a better chance of surviving.I tried to be positive and left it all to God.“I was allowed to see my mother after putting on personal protective equipment. She was conscious and could talk but quickly ran out of breath. I managed to recite Surah Yasin for her, comb her hair and help her put on a headscarf.“I apologised for everything and tried not to cry in front of her even though the situation was heart-wrenching, ” Siti Raudhah recalled.On May 28, she said her parents got to speak over the phone and exchanged words of forgiveness.“That morning, my sister also managed to video call our mother but at 7.50am, we received a call from the doctor saying that our mum had passed away in her sleep.”Although Siti Raudhah was devastated by her mother’s passing, it was her father who was most affected as he had lost his life partner of 49 years.“My father was allowed to go home on May 30, two days after my mum died. He was too heartbroken and could not bring himself to enter the house as she was gone forever.“My parents were one of those couples who did everything together, from cooking to gardening.“They also used to wear matching clothes, that was how romantic they were, ” she said.Siti Raudhah said it took a long time to coax her father to enter their house and that she now keeps him company and cooks dishes that her late mother used to prepare.“So for everyone out there, I hope that we are all aware that we must fight Covid-19 together.“Although we all miss gathering with our family, just video call them for now because if your loved one is gone, you won’t be able to look at their face or talk to them anymore, ” she concluded.\n",

      "(Reuters) -Emma Coronel Aispuro, the wife of Mexican narcotics kingpin Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, is expected to plead guilty this week to federal charges of helping him run the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.The Times, citing an unnamed person familiar with the case, reported that Coronel would appear in Federal District Court in Washington on Thursday morning to enter her plea.Her plea agreement will not require her to cooperate with U.S. authorities or provide information about her husband's allies, business partners or relatives, the Times reports.Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice declined to comment, and the Drug Enforcement Administration had no immediate comment. Lawyers for Coronel did not respond to requests for comment.Coronel, a 31-year-old former beauty queen, was arrested at Washington's Dulles International Airport in February.Prosecutors accused her of working with her husband in running the drug cartel and conspiring in his infamous July 2015 escape from Mexico's Altiplano prison through a mile-long tunnel dug from his cell.After a high-profile trial in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York, Guzman, 63, was convicted in February 2019 of masterminding a multibillion dollar drug enterprise. He was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years and incarcerated in the federal Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.Coronel, a dual U.S.-Mexico citizen, married Guzman in 2007 at age 18. The couple has twin daughters.In 2019, Coronel launched a clothing brand in the United States and she also appeared in a U.S. reality show about mafia families.(Reporting by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles, Mark Hosenball in Washington and Brad Brooks in Lubbock, Texas; editing by Richard Pullin)\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Children between the ages of 12 and 17 are expected to be included in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme in its fifth phase, says Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba.He said this phase, which would likely kick off in August, would only take place if the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) gives its approval for the Pfizer vaccine to be used on children in this age group.Dr Adham, when contacted, said so far only Pfizer had submitted a request for its vaccine to be used on children.Currently, Covid-19 vaccines available in the country can only be given to those aged 18 and above, as regulated by the NPRA.Dr Adham said as most of the Pfizer vaccine supply is expected to have arrived by then and herd immunity for adults would have been achieved, the government intends to also ensure children are protected from the virus.“Data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in children is already out and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its use on children.“However, locally, Pfizer would need to submit an application to the NPRA to expand the use of its Covid-19 vaccine in children aged 12 and above.“In the interim, the Special Committee on Covid-19 Vaccine Supply Access Guarantee and the Disease Control Division under the Health Ministry would also have to endorse the use of the vaccine in children, ” he added.Dr Adham said that as of now, Pfizer is still waiting for a reply to its letter to the NPRA dated May 31.“Only after the NPRA goes through all the necessary procedures and gives its approval in black and white will the government proceed with the administration of the vaccine on children in Phase Five.“As this involves children, we will take all precautions and efforts to make sure the vaccines given to our children are safe and protect them from Covid-19, ” he added.He also pointed out that Malaysia would not be the first in the region vaccinating children in that age bracket as authorities in Singapore and the Philippines had approved the Pfizer vaccine for children between 12 and 17 years of age.Meanwhile, consultant paediatrician and paediatric cardiologist Datuk Dr Zulkifli Ismail said although children admitted with Covid-19 were generally active and relatively asymptomatic, it could be fatal if the child had malnutrition to begin with.“It appears that children are less affected from the beginning and when they are infected, they don’t get such severe infections as adults.“In data that we have received from our paediatric colleagues, the only exception to this is in Indonesia, where many children were affected from the very beginning, with high rates of deaths reported there.“This was attributed to the higher rates of concomitant malnutrition, ” said Dr Zulkifli when contacted.The specialist with KPJ Selangor Specialist Hospital in Shah Alam is also involved in the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme through Immunise4Life, a collaboration between the Health Ministry, Malaysian Paediatric Association and Malaysian Society of Infectious Disease & Chemotherapy.“There have been more deaths and more severe infections among children of late because we now have community spread.“Overall, Covid-19-positive children are still not as severely affected as adults. The deaths documented by the ministry have been mainly from those with comorbidities, ” said Dr Zulkifli.These comorbidities include malnutrition (as in Indonesia) or obesity, childhood cancers and tumours, children with respiratory illnesses like chronic asthma on steroids, or those with chronic lung disease requiring oxygen, diabetes, complex congenital heart diseases and those who have undergone or are awaiting surgery, and thalassaemia patients on regular transfusions.“Even though children sometimes cannot express themselves and tell anyone if they are unwell, there would be signs of problems like rapid breathing, lethargy, being generally unwell, and persistent crying that would indicate to us that the child is more unwell than we think.“The treatment protocol for children in categories 4 and 5 is similar to adults. They will require oxygen or ventilation if they deteriorate, ” said Dr Zulkifli.He added that before embarking on the mass vaccination of children, it would be better to complete the vaccination of adults first as they are the ones who bring the virus home.“In order for children to be vaccinated, the vaccines have to show no long-term effects, especially with the risk of auto-immune diseases.“We know that children below 18 years of age make up 32% of our population, so eventually the age will have to be lowered – but not before definite results of long-term safety, ” said Dr Zulkifli.He advised parents to teach their children to be aware of their surroundings, practise physical distancing, avoid crowds, wash their hands frequently and wear masks.“Many children are sent to nurseries or childcare centres where they will bring back infections. So, parents have to ensure the carers have all been vaccinated and practise good hygiene. The same for kindergartens and schools.“Our priority should be to protect our children so all staff in these schools, kindergartens and daycare centres must show proof they have been vaccinated, ” said Dr Zulkifli.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Countries are looking at strategies to curb Covid-19 infections among children, with some even approving vaccines for adolescents.Much of the focus during the pandemic has been on elderly folk and those with comorbidities.However, as cases surge in the global community, the number of Covid-19 infections has also risen among those under the age of 18.In Brazil, deaths among children under the age of 10 were reportedly over 2, 000, according to data as of mid-April.More than 60, 000 children in the age group have been hospitalised for Covid-19 in the country, with many facing severe symptoms such as muscle aches, diarrhoea and abdominal pain.In July last year, Indonesia was said to be set to have the world’s highest rate of child deaths from Covid-19.At that time, the Indonesian Paediatric Society said it believed more than 300 children in Indonesia had died from the disease.Now, as vaccination rates gain traction across the world, children and adolescents are slowly being included for such vaccination.The United Kingdom has recently approved Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine for 12 to 15-year-olds, while children of that same age bracket have already been receiving the shot in the United States.The Chinese government has also approved Sinovac jabs to be given to those aged between three and 17.Closer to home, Singapore has also approved the Pfizer vaccine for children aged between 12 and 15.Health experts in Malaysia have been urging the public to adhere to the rules and get vaccinated.International Islamic University of Malaysia public health specialist Asst Prof Dr Mohammad Farhan Rusli said the increase in infections among children was a cause for concern.“It is worrying. It is extremely important for those who can receive the vaccines to take them. Only through herd immunity, we can protect these vulnerable children from getting infected, ” he said.He advised parents to keep their children at home, to minimise contact with others, especially in crowded places.“They should also emphasise good hygiene practices, such as the 3Ws (Wash hands, Wear masks, Warn about Covid-19) as well as avoid 3Cs (Crowded places, Confined spaces, Close conversations), ” he said.Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming, of Universiti Malaya’s Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, also pointed out children may risk infecting others.“Although the symptoms and mortality rate of Covid-19 among children is very low compared with adults, they still can be the source of infection to older people and high-risk groups.“On the other hand, children with pre-existing medical conditions will be at risk of severe disease and intensive care admission, ” she said.She said while children need to be protected against Covid-19, vaccination should be prioritised among older persons and high-risk groups while the country’s vaccines are in short supply.“If all the adults are vaccinated, we may have achieved 60-70% coverage, which from US and UK experiences, the transmission rate would reduce substantially, as well as rates of hospitalisation and death.“If there is supply, children above 12 years old should be vaccinated like in the US, UK and Singapore, ” she said.She said onsite schooling should be delayed until infection rates are reduced and parents should abide by the standard operating procedure when they are in public places.“If parents think they are at risk of getting infected while they work, they should maintain physical distancing with the children, and refrain from sharing food or eating together with the children, ” she said.However, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Azmi Mohd Tamil said it must be determined if the increase of cases among children is disproportionately high compared to earlier trends.“We must first verify if it is an apparent rise or real rise in cases among children. This is because the total number of new cases has risen. We need to know the proportion of children getting infected, ” he said.He added that schools had now been closed, and there is a rule that children below the age of 12 must stay at home except for specific reasons.“Steps have been taken, but the ultimate responsibility lies with oneself to comply with the rules, ” he said.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Spending almost two weeks in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19 last year is something housewife Sharifah Farah Ayuni Syed Rosli does not want to go through again – ever.Now, she and her husband have only one important thing in mind – to look after and protect their three children from being infected.“That harrowing experience was enough to jolt us. We hope neither we nor our kids get infected by the disease,” said the 30-year-old from Kota Baru.Recalling her stay, Sharifah said she spent about 13 days in hospital with her businessman husband Mohd Azlee Che Mohd Zaid and their son, Mir Ali Zafar, who was three months old at the time.While she was well cared for by medical workers there, the housewife said she was mentally exhausted thinking about her two other children, who tested negative and placed in their grandmother’s care.“Nowadays, I get a little anxious if I feel unwell, worrying if I contracted Covid-19 again.“Thankfully, we are all healthy. We understand that we must stay at home to guard against getting infected,” she said.Recently, Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said there was a rise in infections among younger children, some of whom had to be treated at intensive care units.Sharifah said she and her husband tried to set good examples for their three children, now aged six, four and one-and-a-half, and remind them to wash their hands and wear their face masks properly.She said her children understood that they could not go for outings because of the pandemic.“We are grateful that they are obedient and follow our advice.“There are times when they get upset and sulk, as children sometimes do, but they listen,” Sharifah said.Kiranjit Muniandy wonders if she is doing enough to protect her 19-month-old daughter from getting infected.“The number of kids getting infected of late is alarming. It’s tougher now because she is at that age where she just wants to touch everything,” she said.Kiranjit, 39, was also worried about the high number of new cases daily.“My husband and I have decided not to go out and stay at home.“We have also stopped receiving visitors. We take care of our daughter while we work from home.“Thankfully, we work on shifts. My husband works in the day while I work at night so we take turns,” said the banking executive.Kiranjit said she would take every precaution to protect her family from being infected and hoped that the pandemic would end soon as she misses her family in Sabah.“My daughter has not met her grandparents for over a year,” she said.\n",

      "TORONTO (Reuters) -Relatives of a Canadian Muslim family killed in London, Ontario, when a man rammed them with his pick-up truck this week are urging the wider community to oppose racism and Islamophobia after police said the suspect was motivated by hate.The four family members killed on Sunday were: Salman Afzaal, 46; his wife, Madiha Salman, 44; their 15-year-old daughter, Yumna Afzaal; and Afzaal's 74-year-old mother, whose name has not yet been released. Their 9-year-old son, Fayez Afzaal, remained hospitalized on Tuesday with serious but non-life-threatening injuries.A 20-year-old suspect named Nathaniel Veltman is in police custody, charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.In a statement issued late on Monday, relatives of the victims disputed an initial police appraisal that the accused man was not a member of any hate group and had no accomplices.\"The young man who committed this act of terror was influenced by a group that he associated with, and the rest of the community must take a strong stand against this,\" the relatives said in a statement, though they did not identify the group or explain how they know about the alleged ties.\"We need to stand against hate and Islamophobia and raise awareness in our communities and across all the political spectrum,\" they added.Police, citing witnesses, said Veltman jumped the curb in his vehicle and struck five members of the family. Veltman, with no previous criminal record, is due back in court on Thursday after being remanded to custody on Monday.The relatives of the victims said the children had both been top students and their parents excelled in their fields.\"Everyone who knew Salman and the rest of the ... family know the model family they were as Muslims, Canadians and Pakistanis. They were always there giving and participating in spreading goodness,\" the statement said.The family has declined to comment further.'COULD HAVE BEEN ME'Sana Yasir, a family friend for 12 years who lived near where they were killed, launched a GoFundMe page to raise funds for charitable donations to be made on behalf of the victims.Yasir said she and her relatives would see them frequently on their daily walks.The family members were active members of London's Muslim and Pakistani communities and the children attended the local Islamic school. They moved to Canada from Pakistan in 2007, according to local media reports.\"We've seen the kids grow up,\" Yasir said.Yasir noted that the women were wearing hijabs and traditional shalwar kameez - a pair of loose, pleated trousers worn with a long shirt by many women from South Asia.\"They were visible,\" Yasir said. \"It could have been me.\"The GoFundMe page described Afzaal, a physiotherapist, as a cricket enthusiast with a warm smile and Salman as a scholar working hard to obtain her PhD in civil engineering from the University of Western Ontario.As of Tuesday morning the page had raised just shy of C$270,000 ($223,454 in U.S. dollars).On Tuesday morning, Fayez Afzaal was alert in the hospital and in stable condition, Yasir said.The local school board said Yumna Afzaal, a ninth-grade student, would be \"deeply missed,\" adding that flags would be flown at half-staff for the week and a trauma-response team would be available at area schools.The attack was the worst against Canadian Muslims since a man gunned down six members of a Quebec City mosque in 2017.\"After Quebec it was: are we safe praying in our mosques? And now it's: are we safe going out for a walk after dinner?\" said Nawaz Tahrir, a spokesperson for the London Muslim Mosque, where Afzaal was a familiar figure.Tahrir added that Canadians have to \"ask more of our leaders\" and enact policies that address the causes of anti-Muslim hate.\"Until we do that, I fear that this isn't going to be the last incident,\" Tahrir said.($1 = 1.2083 Canadian dollars)(Reporting by Moira Warburton in Vancouver and Anna Mehler Paperny in Toronto;Editing by Denny Thomas, Will Dunham and Raissa Kasolowsky)\n",

She lodged the report on May 21.Sources said police were also investigating a claim by Among's part-time employee Dane Lenard Kovacs, an Australian, that his passport which was given to get his work pass done was illegally held back (by Among).The sources said that Among might also face charges in connection with allegedly withholding the passport.Meanwhile, when contacted on Tuesday (June 8), Among's lawyer Marcel Jude said he had not yet been informed if Among would be charged.Among was arrested on June 3 shortly after he gave a press conference denying the sexual assault claims. His seven-day remand will end on June 9.Among, who was Sabah STAR's Putatan parliament coordinator, has been suspended by the party.\n",

      "PARIS (Reuters) -A man slapped President Emmanuel Macron in the face on Tuesday during a walkabout in southern France.Macron later said he had not feared for his safety, and that nothing would stop him carrying on with his job.In a video circulating on social media, Macron reached out his hand to greet a man in a small crowd of onlookers standing behind a metal barrier as he visited a professional training college for the hospitality industry.The man, who was dressed in a khaki T-shirt, then shouted \"Down with Macronia\" (\"A Bas La Macronie\") and slapped Macron on the left side of his face.He could also be heard shouting \"Montjoie Saint Denis\", the battle cry of the French army when the country was still a monarchy.Two of Macron's security detail tackled the man in the T-shirt, and another ushered Macron away. Another video posted on Twitter showed that the president, a few seconds later, returned to the line of onlookers and resumed shaking hands.The local mayor, Xavier Angeli, told franceinfo radio that Macron urged his security to \"leave him, leave him\" as the offender was being held to the ground.Two people were arrested, a police source told Reuters. The identify of the man who slapped Macron, and his motives, were unclear.The slogan the man shouted has been co-opted in the past few years by royalists and people on the far-right in France, Fiametta Venner, a political scientist who studies French extremists, told broadcaster BFMTV.Macron was on a visit to the Drome region to meet restaurateurs and students and talk about returning to a normal life after the COVID-19 pandemic.It was one of a series of visits he is making, his aides say, to take the nation's pulse before a presidential election next year. He later continued his visit to the region.SECURITY DETAILMacron, a former investment banker, is accused by his opponents of being a part of a moneyed elite aloof from the concerns of ordinary citizens.In part to counter those allegations, he on occasion seeks out close contact with voters in impromptu situations, but this can throw up challenges for his security detail.Footage at the start of Tuesday's slapping incident showed Macron jogging over to the barrier where the onlookers were waiting, leaving his security detail struggling to keep up. When the slap happened, two of the security detail were at his side, but two others had only just caught up.In an interview with the Dauphine Libere newspaper after the attack, Macron said: \"You cannot have violence, or hate, either in speech or actions. Otherwise, it's democracy itself that is threatened.\"\"Let us not allow isolated events, ultraviolent individuals... to take over the public debate: they don't deserve it.\"Macron said he had not feared for his safety, and had continued shaking hands with members of the public after he was struck. \"I kept going, and I will keep going. Nothing will stop me,\" he said.In 2016, Macron, who was economy minister at the time, was pelted with eggs by hard-left trade unionists during a strike against labour reforms. Macron described that incident as \"par for the course\" and said it would not curb his determination.Two years later, anti-government \"yellow vest\" protesters heckled and booed Macron in an incident that government allies said left the president shaken.(Reporting by Dominique Vidalon, Michel Rose, Sudip Kar-Gupta; Writing by Christian Lowe and Richard Lough; Editing by)\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The country's goal to achieve Covid-19 herd immunity by December will be dampened if Malaysians become picky in choosing what vaccines they want, say health experts.Universiti Malaya Department of Social and Preventive Medicine Faculty of Medicine's Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming said the vaccination process response rate will be reduced if people start to choose what vaccine brands they want.This, she said, will slow down the country’s chance of achieving herd immunity.“There is a lot of information available in explaining the efficacy and effectiveness of various brands of vaccines,\" she said.She added that one particular brand of vaccine may not be as good as another in reducing transmission, but it is equally good - more than 90% - in preventing serious complications and hospitalisation, as well as death.“This information perhaps should be presented in ways that are easier to understand by the less informed groups, ” she said when contacted on Tuesday (June 7).Dr Moy said doctors from general practitioner (GP) clinics who are much more in contact with the public should play a bigger role in promoting vaccination and allaying public’s fear of certain vaccines.She suggested that NGOs should also do more outreach programmes on these issues.“The government also should be more transparent with the data on vaccinations for different brands, and the number and types of side effects experienced as well as breakthrough cases and its outcome. With these data, we may be able to gain the public’s trust on the various brands of vaccines, ” she said.Previously, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme Khairy Jamaluddin urged those who have vaccination appointments not to reject a particular vaccine in favour of another, after several senior citizens who turned up for their vaccination appointments at the KL Convention Centre vaccination centre had rejected one brand of vaccine and wanted another brand instead.Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Azmi Mohd Tamil pointed out that certain parts of the Malaysian population are rejecting not only one brand of vaccine, but all forms of Covid-19 vaccinations.“This movement has gained traction due to ignorance and misinformation in the social media and communities. Therefore, the ability of this country to achieve herd immunity in a short period is not in sight.\"It is unfortunate that such ignorance and wrongful fears are concentrated only in certain parts of the population.\"Efforts must be made to identify the cause of vaccine hesitancy and community leaders must be roped in to help their communities register and be vaccinated, ” he said.Dr Azmi believed that the desire to register for the vaccine is very low, especially in the Malay-belt states.“The vaccine hesitancy in such states among those already registered are very high. Kelantan and Kedah have more than 10, 000 defaulters each, ” he said.He added that those who are eager to be vaccinated must be facilitated to get inoculated, otherwise the frustration among these groups will also grow.International Islamic University of Malaysia public health specialist Asst Prof Dr Mohammad Farhan Rusli said receiving any brand or type of vaccine will reduce an individual's risk of developing severe Covid-19 and will help free ICUs, hospitals and wards.He assured the public that they do not have to be afraid of the vaccines, as all the vaccines have received the World Health Organisation (WHO) Emergency Use Approval.“The vaccines have also been extensively checked by the NPRA on its safety use, ” he said, adding that the best vaccine is the one that is available to them.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): The Defence Ministry (Mindef) has confirmed that 98 crewmen of the Royal Malaysian Navy ship, KD Mahawangsa, tested positive for Covid-19.Defence Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the crew had taken the RTK Antigen test before boarding the ship but were confirmed positive for Covid-19 after a few days onboard the ship.\"So far, they were not showing any symptoms, but we have isolated them and placed all of them under quarantine.\"InsyaAllah, after 10 days (of quarantine), they will take the PCR test, and if the results came back negative, then they will be allowed to disembark, ” he told a press conference after visiting the drive-through vaccination centre at the Sungai Besi military camp here Tuesday (June 8).Also present were Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba and Chief of Defence Force General Tan Sri Affendi Buang.Ismail Sabri said the ministry had yet to ascertain how the crew of the ship were infected with the coronavirus.\"As we know, Covid-19 is in the community. These crewmen must have been infected with Covid-19 before they boarded the ship, probably when they were at home or while buying groceries at a supermarket, ” he said.Meanwhile, the Senior Minister said he was in the midst of discussing with the Covid-19 Vaccine Supply Access Guarantee Special Committee the possibility to allow Mindef to get the vaccine supply directly from Pharmaniaga Berhad, which is responsible for bottling the Sinovac vaccine.He said by doing so, the herd immunity for military personnel and civil servants under Mindef, as well as their families, could be achieved faster.\"Overall, we have 500, 000 personnel including their families and we target 200, 000 to be vaccinated per month to enable us to achieve herd immunity within three months, ” he added. - Bernama\n",

      "KUCHING: Rural folk in Sarawak's Kapit division have been given the Covid-19 vaccine when they came to the vaccination centre without registering first, says Tan Sri James Masing.The Deputy Chief Minister said the staff of the Kapit Resident's Office, on their own initiative, brought rural residents with their identity cards to be vaccinated on Monday (June 7) even though their names were not on the list of registered recipients.\"The Health Ministry staff were most understanding and gave them the vaccination.\"It seemed they read the Chief Minister's mind,\" he said in a statement on Tuesday (June 8).Masing was responding to Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg's announcement on Monday (June 7) that rural folk in Sarawak would be given the Covid-19 jab if they turn up at vaccination centres without having registered first.The Chief Minister said this was part of the state government's approach to speed up and widen the vaccination programme, which is targeted for completion by August.He said their details would be registered after the jab to be entered into the database of those who have been vaccinated.Masing said the \"inject first, register later\" approach was the correct one in order for eligible Sarawakians to be vaccinated within the scheduled time frame.He said the rural population would never be inoculated in time if the vaccine was only given to those registered via the MySejahtera app.\"Our Internet is almost non-existent in longhouses and villages.\"Besides, not all people in rural areas have handphones,\" he said, adding that the MySejahtera approach favoured the urban community and discriminated against the rural population.Masing also said the relevant authorities should have used the approach suggested by Abang Johari right from the beginning when vaccines were available.\"Red tape and SOP had created unnecessary obstacles to fight Covid-19 and resulted in unnecessary loss of lives,\" he added.\n",

The government has made a policy of giving vaccinations to the sectors allowed to operate, ” he said after jointly chairing the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) meeting with Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad here on Tuesday (June 8).Khairy, who is Science, Technology and Innovation Minister, also said the government would be opening more industry PPV for other sectors in stages.“Besides Pengerang, another PPV would be opened in Johor Baru at Mount Austin by the end of this month before we open for other sectors such as plantation, construction and retail, ” he added.He also said that the government expected to complete vaccinating more than three million people living in Johor by the end of October.Khairy said the target could be achieved if the country does not face any hiccups in obtaining vaccine supplies.He added that the ministry was working closely with the Johor government in coming up with various strategies to make sure the state was able to reach the target.“To achieve the three million target, we need to increase the daily vaccine recipients from 14,000 a day to 50,000 a day.“We will do it in stages where, by September, we aim to vaccinate 30,000 individuals per day, ” he said.Khairy added that among the strategies discussed was the inclusion of more private healthcare players in the national immunisation programme.“The state government suggested opening up more mega PPV at each district in Johor and we will be looking into the suggestion.“We will also be getting private hospitals and clinics as we need more PPV and a bigger workforce, ” he said, adding that the Pfizer-BioNTech manufacturer has given an assurance it will supply 25 million doses to the country by the third quarter of this year.\n",

      "HANOI (AFP): Vietnam, once a model for its successful handling of the pandemic, has started asking for public donations to buy vaccines as it struggles to contain a new coronavirus wave.The Southeast Asian country has vaccinated only about one per cent of its population of nearly 100 million, and authorities have become increasingly alarmed by a recent spike in cases.Since last week, mobile phone users have received up to three text messages urging them to contribute to a Covid-19 vaccine fund, while civil servants have been encouraged to part with a day's pay.Some residents, fearful of the virus' impact on Vietnam's economy -- one of the few in the world to expand last year -- told AFP they support the fundraising drive.Nguyen Tuan Anh, a civil servant, told AFP he had sent around US$50 via bank transfer and SMS payment, as vaccines would mean \"Vietnam's economy will be stable and develop again\".Vietnam's industrial northern provinces -- home to key factories such as Samsung and Foxconn -- have been particularly badly hit by the latest outbreak.Across the country, tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs, according to state media, with bars and restaurants forced to close in major hubs such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City and public gatherings cancelled.Cases have more than tripled since April to reach almost 9,000. Although the number is low in comparison to most of its Southeast Asian neighbours, Vietnam's vaccination rate per capita is the lowest in the region, and among the lowest in Asia, according to an AFP tally.The communist government has said it aims to secure 150 million vaccine doses this year to cover 70 per cent of its population -- at a cost of $1.1 billion.But only $630 million has been allocated to vaccine procurement in the budget.A financial \"contribution from the community and society\" is needed to make a mass roll-out possible, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh told the nation on Saturday during a live broadcast to launch the campaign.By Tuesday (June 8), more than 231,000 individuals and organisations had donated $181 million to the campaign.Another $140 million has been promised by businesses, the Ministry of Finance said.However, the campaign has been shunned by some who are concerned with how the money will be spent.\"I am not sure if the donated money will be used for the sole purpose of buying vaccines to inoculate every citizen...I don't think I have enough trust to give them my money,\" said office worker Pham Mai Chi.\n",

      "SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): A new tool has been invented by researchers in Singapore which could lead to faster diagnosis of heart disease.Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), it uses electrocardiograms (ECGs) and had an accuracy rate of 98.5 percent. ECGs measure the electrical activity of heartbeats to detect heart abnormalities.Almost one of three deaths in Singapore in 2019 was due to heart disease or stroke, figures from the Singapore Heart Foundation show. The number of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease in Singapore has also increased from 2017 to 2019.Early detection can also prevent complications such as kidney disease.Invented by a team from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) and the National Heart Centre Singapore (NHCS), the new diagnostic tool uses an AI machine learning algorithm that enables computers to learn from past experiences like a human.The algorithm trains the tool to recognise patterns in patients' ECGs by inputting examples of ECG signals that reflect cardiovascular diseases.In a pilot study, the researchers used the tool to analyse ECG signals from 92 healthy individuals as well as seven patients with coronary artery disease, 148 who had suffered a heart attack and 15 with congestive heart failure.The data were taken from four public databases.The team found that the AI tool could identify ECG signals associated with healthy people and patients with the three different cardiovascular diseases with an accuracy of more than 98.5 per cent.The study was published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Computers in Biology and Medicine in May.\"Although confirming the specific disease still requires additional testing, our diagnostic tool will allow physicians to triage patients more efficiently and to streamline the number and type of downstream confirmatory tests,\" said Clinical Associate Professor Tan Ru San, senior consultant at the Department of Cardiology in NHCS, who co-authored the study.Associate Professor Eddie Ng Yin Kwee from NTU's School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who co-led the study, added that the diagnostic tool could lead to advancements in merging AI with medical solutions.The tool is still in the preliminary stages of research and will need to be validated with more data.The team plans to start conducting further trials with a larger database from local hospitals within 18 to 24 months to validate its clinical use.Assoc Prof Tan said: \"This is very exciting but we must also tamper our enthusiasm with reality...this is only the beginning.\"He added: \"We can always refine the technique and there may be nice tricks that the team can actually do, but we think this is really a promising start.\"Dr Daniel Yeo, a cardiologist at Apex Heart Clinic in Gleneagles Hospital, welcomed the development, saying the new AI tool would help doctors, nurses and other allied healthcare professionals identify abnormal ECGs and make more confident assessments.\"The number of cardiologists is small, and they cannot read every single ECG done. This AI tool will therefore be useful in the general practice setting, such as a large and busy polyclinic,\" said Dr Yeo, who hopes the cost of using the tool would not be too high.Dr Paul Ong, a cardiologist at Heart Specialist International in Mount Elizabeth Novena Specialist Centre, added that the AI tool could help those who lack specialist knowledge quickly identify patients with cardiac emergencies in ambulances or emergency departments, though it is also important to not over rely on AI to make the diagnosis and miss out on the patient's history and examination findings.The research team hopes the tool could complement current techniques of diagnosing heart diseases, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).They said the tool could also be extended to detect other heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular rhythm in a person's heart.They added it could also be used with wearable devices such as smart watches for the monitoring of heart conditions in patients in future. - The Straits Times/Asia News Network\n",

      "BEIJING (Reuters): China's southern Guangdong province, spooked by a rise in novel coronavirus infections since May, stepped up mass testing this week in a handful of cities, including those that have yet to report a single case.While the numbers of confirmed infections and asymptomatic cases remain small compared to massive outbreaks seen in other countries such as India and Brazil, China is taking no chances.Guangdong, China's manufacturing hub and biggest province by economic output, has reported more than 110 confirmed cases since May 21. Its provincial capital Guangzhou has accounted for almost 90% of the confirmed cases, spurring the city of over 18 million people to ramp up mass testing.Since starting the mass testing on May 26, Guangzhou has taken nearly 28 million nucleic acid samples, with 40 people showing positive for the coronavirus, a spokesperson of the city's health authority told reporters on Tuesday.Many people have been tested multiple times.A worker at Yantian port in Shenzhen, a city of more than 17 million people, tested positive after 11 previous tests from May 21 to June 1 came back negative. His village has since undergone five rounds of nucleic acid tests.Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Foshan at different times have launched mass testing after reporting infections. Zhongshan and Jiangmen - two cities in Guangdong that have yet to report any cases - also initiated mass testing earlier this week as a precautionary step.Singapore, since the weekend, has barred short-term visitors who have been to Guangdong within the last 21 days.For June 7, China reported 33 new coronavirus cases on the mainland, up from 19 cases a day earlier, the health authority said on Tuesday.Of the new cases, 19 were local transmissions from Guangdong, the National Health Commission said.China also reported 16 new asymptomatic infections, compared with 21 a day earlier. China does not classify symptomless infections as confirmed cases.By Monday, China had a total of 91, 300 confirmed infections. Its death toll stood unchanged at 4, 636.\n",

      "Global Times, June 8 - Fine words will accompany the G7 summit this week. Much will be promised. And little will be delivered. It has long been like this. The G7 is no longer fit for purpose.Comprising the US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan, in the 1970s the G7 was the overlord of the global economy. Today, the G7 is but a pale shadow of what it once was, reduced to the role of a declining faction within the global economy. It still talks in grandiose terms about its intentions, but the world has learnt to discount them. It is entirely appropriate that this week's summit will be chaired by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a grandmaster of verbal exaggeration and empty gestures.The role and importance of the G7 has been greatly diminished by the rise of the developing world. The latter now accounts for almost two-thirds of the global economy compared with one-third by the West: in the 1970s, it was exactly the opposite, the West enjoying a two-third share and the developing world just one-third. The most dramatic illustration of the G7's waning authority came in 2008 when, at the height of the financial crisis, it was effectively displaced by the more representative G20.Ever since, the G7 has increasingly become an institution in search of a role. Under Biden, as if to confirm its eclipse as a global institution, there is an ongoing attempt to reframe G7 as the representative and champion of the democratic world in the struggle against autocracy, to this end, South Korea, India, Australia and South Africa have been invited to attend the G7 summit this week. There is even talk of the G7 becoming the D10 (D being a reference to democracy). This, however, would only serve to emphasize the declining authority of the G7: from global leader to ideological sect.The truth, however, is that this proposal is unlikely to gain assent either among existing G7 members or potential new members, excepting perhaps Australia. Here we get to the heart of the crisis of the G7. It is the rise of China, above all else, that has transformed the global economy, sidelined the G7 and, at the same time, reconfigured the various G7 economies. Good relations with China are fundamental to the economic prospects of Germany, France and Italy. That is why they are opposed to the G7 becoming an anti-China crusade. So is Japan; and likewise would-be recruits such as South Korea and South Africa. Here laid bare, then, are the fault lines of the G7 and any potential extended membership. The West is divided and fragmenting. The authority of the US is in decline, no longer able to get its way as it once was.The best illustration of the growing impotence of the G7 concerns its relationship with the developing world. For eight years, the West has been trying to find a way of responding to the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The subject is due to be raised again at this week's G7 summit. All the ideas that have been offered as a basis of a Western alternative to BRI have come to nought. This failure is extraordinarily significant and most revealing about the West on the one hand and China on the other.BRI is an eloquent articulation of China's relationship with the developing world, rooted in its own semi-colonial past and its position as a developing country. The West, in contrast, has failed because its history has been precisely the opposite, one of colonization and the exploitation and subjugation of these countries. It has neither the experience, empathy nor motivation that is required. The existential gap between the rich Western world and the developing world is a multidimensional chasm.A dramatic example of the West's indifference to the needs of the developing world will be on full display at the G7 summit. Although the US and UK, and increasingly Western Europe, have vaccinated a majority of their populations against COVID-19, the UK, to take one example, has not exported a single dose of vaccine to the developing world. It has kept all its vaccines for itself, even though its existing stock far exceeds its own future needs. As each new variant spreads around the world, however, it has become patently clear to everyone that no country will be protected until every country is protected.In a pandemic, no country is an island. The US, which has so far failed to export a single dose of vaccine, is promising to export 80 million doses of vaccines later this year. Compare this with China's record. In addition to the 777 million vaccinations already carried out in China, it has exported more than 300 million doses of vaccines to the developing world. Over half the vaccinations in Latin America, for example, have been sourced by China. It seems all too likely that the West will fail in its moral responsibility to vaccinate the developing world until it is too late and many millions have died unnecessarily.The author was until recently a Senior Fellow at the Department of Politics and International Studies at Cambridge University.

      "KUALA LUMPUR: Hollywood producer Riza Aziz Abdul Aziz has been sued by 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) and its three subsidiaries over allegations of misappropriating US$250mil, said to have been used for real estate purchases and financing movie productions.According to a court document, Riza, who is also the stepson of former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, was named as the first defendant while a film company he co-founded, Red Granite Pictures Inc., was the second defendant.Red Granite Capital Ltd, a related company, was named the third defendant and US-based law firm Shearman & Sterling was the fourth.The other three 1MDB subsidiaries that are the plaintiffs are 1MDB Energy Holdings Ltd, 1MDB Energy Ltd and 1MDB Energy (Langat) Ltd.The matter was brought up for case management before the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Tuesday (June 8).According to the writ of summons, 1MDB claimed that Riza had received approximately US$250mil in funds that were misappropriated from the sovereign wealth fund by its officers and their associates in 2011 and 2012.It said that Riza, who controlled Red Granite Pictures and Red Granite Capital,\"knew or ought to have known that those funds had been misappropriated\".It claimed that Riza and the two companies used the funds for their personal benefit and for the benefit of their associates, including to finance movie productions and purchase real estate.It also claimed that the fourth defendant, Shearman & Sterling, had permitted Riza and his associate, fugitive financier Low Taek Jho (better known as Jho Low), to use the law firm's interest on lawyer accounts to launder a substantial portion of the misappropriated funds.1MDB further claimed that Shearman & Sterling had actual knowledge, or knowledge inferred from wilful blindness or reckless indifference, or alternatively was put on enquiry and failed to make necessary enquiries, that the funds in question were the proceeds of crime.1MDB wants a court declaration that Riza and the two companies are liable for the misappropriated funds and alternatively, a declaration that the plaintiffs are entitled to repayment of the said funds allegedly received by the three defendants on the basis of unjust enrichment as a consequence of the misappropriation.It is also claiming damages or compensation from Shearman & Sterling for alleged breaches of statutory duties by the law firm for dishonest assistance or abetment of the first three defendants, as well as interest, costs and other reliefs deemed fit by the court.The lawsuit is among 22 filed by 1MDB and its subsidiary SRC International Sdn Bhd against individuals including 1MDB's former board of directors who allegedly defrauded the companies.It was reported that the Finance Ministry confirmed that 1MDB and SRC filed a total of 22 civil suits to recover assets worth over RM96.6bil, including about RM300mil against various local parties.The ministry said there were six writs by 1MDB and 16 by SRC filed on May 7.The writs filed by 1MDB are against nine entities, including two foreign financial institutions and 25 individuals, while those filed by SRC are against eight entities and 15 individuals for various alleged wrongdoings.These include breach of contractual, statutory, common law and fiduciary duties; breach of trust; fraud; conspiracy to defraud; fraudulent misrepresentation; fraudulent breach of duties and trust; abuse of power; breach of fiduciary duties in public office; and dishonest assistance in misappropriation of funds.\"1MDB and SRC contend that these entities and/or individuals have been unjustly enriched by wrongfully receiving monies from 1MDB or SRC,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n",

Cubes of ice are manufactured by machines and there is no human contact after they are sealed in bags.“Dessert or beverage stalls that usually use crushed ice can switch to using packaged ice in smaller tubes or cubes, ” he added.“Restaurants that use crushed ice to keep their meat and ingredients fresh can cover the ice with plastic first, so the food does not touch the ice directly.” - The Nation/Asia News Network\n",

      "JAKARTA (The Straits Times/ANN): When Parliamentary Speaker Puan Maharani, the daughter of former president Megawati Sukarnoputri, arrived at the headquarters of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) in Semarang, Central Java, on May 22, it was to meet 100 party leaders including district heads in person and online.Included on the agenda: awarding a 10 million rupiah (US$700) prize, as well as Puan's autograph, to the winner of a photo competition, and discussing a plan to grow vegetables at the party's headquarters.The invite list included members of the legislative assembly and representative party elders but explicitly stated that Central Java Governor, Ganjar Pranowo, was not invited.The incident underscores the increasingly strained relationship between Ganjar, 52, and his party despite a slew of opinion polls in recent months that suggest he might be the top contender to replace President Joko Widodo at elections in 2024.For his part, Ganjar says the \"viral story\" doesn't faze him.\"It doesn't affect my work. All PDI-P party officials already know that we have to do our own portion of work. Be it as a governor, mayor or in parliament. You do the best at your job and no need to think of anything else,\" Ganjar told The Straits Times in an interview on June 3.\"The decision in regards to candidates for higher office falls to our party leader,\" Ganjar told ST during the interview over Zoom from Semarang, referring to Megawati.Ganjar declined to comment on whether he is eyeing the presidency.Even so, three years into his second and final term as governor of the country's third-largest province by population, the escalating row with his party leadership, and the family of Indonesia's independence leader Sukarno, threatens to overshadow years of work touting his province's relatively low wages, infrastructure and improving governance.Since he entered office, Central Java's gross domestic product has soared by a third when measured by 2010 prices. Foreign direct investment jumped nearly fourfold during the four years to 2019 before halving in 2020 owing to the pandemic.In 2016 he helped shepherd into being the 2, 200 hectare Kendal Industrial Zones - a joint venture between Singapore's Sembcorp Development and Indonesia's Jababeka, both industrial estate developers. It has so far netted nearly half a billion US dollars in investment.New transport infrastructure such as the Trans Java expressway completed in December 2018, abundant power thanks to a new 2000MW coal fired power plant which went into operation last year, and monthly wages that can be little more than half of what is paid at industrial parks elsewhere on the island, have been a big draw for investors.\"When it comes to labour wages, we're competitive,\" Ganjar said.\"This is what's pushing investment here.\"Ganjar swept to power in 2013, on the Javanese slogan \"Boten korupsi dan boten ngapusi\" - No corruption, no deception. He rose to prominence helped by his carefully honed image as a reformer.Senior bureaucrats were required to report their wealth to the graft watchdog, the Corruption Eradication Commission.Leveraging off his 3.4 million followers on Instagram and 1.9 million on Twitter he invited members of the public to report suspected graft, including instances of civil servants demanding bribes from underlings in return for a promotion.A 2014 video of him confronting an unscrupulous toll bridge operator who was pocketing fares has been viewed at least 7 million times on YouTube.But his use of social media has put him in the cross hairs of some members of the party, who accuse him of grandstanding. At a gathering last week, Ms Megawati chastised party members who \"do too little to help the party\" without naming Mr Ganjar.Even so, should Ganjar run, opinion surveys suggest he would be competitive.Last month, in its first publicly available poll since the 2019 election, the Institute for Social and Economic Research, Education and Information (LP3ES) said Mr Ganjar ranked third with the support of 10 per cent of 1, 200 respondents, out of a field of 19 potential candidates.Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan took 16 per cent, followed by Defence Minister and two time presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto with 13 per cent. Puan ranked 15th with 0.5 per cent.Other polls last month from Kompas Research and Indicator Politik indicate similar rankings for the men.LP3ES director Fajar Nursahid said Ganjar may have the most potential. Prabowo has twice failed to win the presidency, while Anies' backing by religious conservatives at the 2017 Jakarta election has earned him the ire of a large chunk of voters.\"Pak Anies attracts a lot of negative sentiment,\" Fajar told ST.\"If Ganjar can increase his name recognition outside Central Java, his level of support can increase and increase dramatically.\"For now his party has other ideas.Puan as the party's nominee for president with Governor Baswedan as her running mate.Agus Riwanto, a political analyst and lecturer at the Sebelas Maret University in Surakarta reckons Ganjar will struggle to retain his standing with the media once he leaves office a full year before the 2024 election.\"He won't be able to blow up the media like he's been able to until now,\" Agus told ST.\"The advantage will slip to party elites like Puan.\" - The Straits Times/Asia News Network\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) will continue to assist and support its customers affected by the Movement Control Order (MCO) and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.In a statement on Tuesday, Maybank said this was in the form of repayment assistance (RA) packages made available since last year, including loan repayment deferment (moratorium) or reduction in monthly instalment payment.Maybank group president & CEO Datuk Abdul Farid Alias said the bank understands that customers impacted by the pandemic and current movement restriction will face challenges in meeting their repayment obligations.He gave an assurance the affected customers will continue to have access to the assistance they require, to ease their burdens and get them through this difficult period.Farid said as at March 2021, about 4.7% of the workforce are unemployed. There are also many individuals whose incomes have been reduced because their compensation or working hours have been cut.“Additionally, many businesses especially the SMEs are struggling with some unable to operate because of the MCO, ” he said.“While the MCO is necessary, we do sympathize with all those affected and have thus made available various RA options to help all of them overcome their difficulties.”Maybank’s repayment assistance packages are as follows:1. Loan deferment (moratorium) for a period of three months or a 50% reduction in the monthly instalment payment for six months. This is available to:• All Individual B40 customers who are registered under the Bantuan Sara Hidup (BSH)/ Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat (BPR) programme (whether they have lost their jobs or not)• Customers from any income segment who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic or MCO• Microenterprises with loan facilities of not more than RM150, 000, and• SMEs which are not permitted to operate during the MCO with total lockdown (i.e. those that are not on the list of permitted sectors as issued by Majlis Keselamatan Negara)Borrowers who fulfil the above criteria and wish to avail of this repayment assistance scheme will only need to contact the Bank to indicate which option they want to choose. This process is hassle-free and no documents are required, only a self-declaration by the borrower.2. Reduction in monthly instalment repaymentAny individual customer regardless of income classification (B40, M40 or T20),or other Microenterprises/SMEs who/which have experienced a reduction in income (including household income for individuals) are eligible for a commensurate reduction in monthly instalments repayment.3. Other forms of Repayment AssistanceOther borrowers who do not fall under the above categories but who may be experiencing financial challenges during this MCO may also discuss with the Bank for alternative repayment assistance packages to help them overcome their difficulties during this period.Maybank said it was encouraging eligible customers who wish to select their option for Repayment Assistance to do so via the following channels:• Visit our Maybank2u Covid-19 Repayment Assistance page at www.maybank2u.com.my/covid19 and click on the “Send email” button (for individual and SME customers respectively) to submit your option.

      "BEIJING (Global Times): China has begun to allow those aged between three and 17 years old to get shots of Covid-19 vaccines, making it the first country to approve these vaccines for such a young age group.Chinese observers said the country will follow the plan step-by-step out of safety concerns and based on production capacity.An official from the vaccine research and development group led by the State Council, the cabinet, confirmed with China Central Television (CCTV) on Sunday (June 6) that China has approved the emergency use of Covid-19 vaccines for those aged between three and 17 years. CCTV did not reveal the official's name.The official said that experts have confirmed the safety and efficacy of giving Covid-19 vaccines to that age group. After relevant approval, the vaccination will start for the age group as the country shifts from vaccinating older people to younger ones.On the same day, Zeng Yixin, deputy director of the National Health Commission (NHC), confirmed in an interview with the Xinhua News Agency that China aims to give Covid-19 shots to at least 70 per cent of its population by year-end.Chinese vaccine experts reached by the Global Times on Monday said vaccinating children above three years old is key for the country to reach herd immunity.But to address safety concerns, the country will cautiously use the vaccines among this age group, by distinguishing them into different groups by age or by initially vaccinating minors living in regions more susceptible to the virus, such as Guangzhou.Apart from some concerns about giving vaccines to minors, restrictions for the large-scale vaccination of children mainly come from the tight supply of Covid-19 vaccines in China, which are being pressured by increasing domestic and foreign demand, as well as the possible mass adoption of booster shots, experts said.The approval fits the world trend of lowering the vaccination age to teenagers, and it makes China the first country in the world to give Covid-19 shots to children as young as three years old, an immunologist based in Beijing told the Global Times on condition of anonymity on Monday.China authorised the emergency use of CoronaVac, the Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by Chinese firm Sinovac, for children aged between three and 17, Sinovac Chairman Yin Weidong told the media on Friday.Feng Duojia, president of the China Vaccine Industry Association, told the Global Times on Monday that approval for Sinopharm's vaccine is also on the way.Following China, Thailand is considering whether to lower the age for Sinovac vaccines to three years old. The Southeast Asian country launched a mass vaccination plan on Monday.Canada was the first country to approve vaccines for children aged 12 and above on May 5. Since then, countries including the US, the UK and Singapore approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for use in children aged 12 to 15, after a review of safety and effectiveness, reports said.Besides Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna is also actively studying the use of the vaccine in younger children. Young children, even toddlers, could also be eligible by the end of the year, Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the US, was quoted as saying by US media.\"Children aged three to 17 are part of the target group of the national vaccination plan, and a key group for the country to reach herd immunity.\"I believe children should receive doses the same as adults, as no solid evidence demonstrates the risk for children is any higher than for adults,\" Tao Lina, a vaccine expert based in Shanghai, told the Global Times on Monday.The use of Covid-19 vaccines on children remains controversial since there has yet to be any open and solid data in clinical trials on children.Some questions also linger, such as whether it is necessary to make children take the risk, as some argue this age group is not susceptible to Covid-19 to the same degree as adults.An immunologist based in Beijing told the Global Times that the possible risks to children cannot be denied, but they are still a key group for the country to reach herd immunity.Thus, to ease public concerns, China is expected to roll out the programme among children step-by-step, either distinguishing them by ages or by grades, or by giving relatively smaller doses of vaccines designated for children.\"As China starts vaccination among children, vaccines and the vaccination plan can always be optimised and adjusted, to fix emerging problems, including security concerns,\" he said.The immunologist said China is more likely to start giving shots for the young when Sinopharm also gets the go-ahead for child recipients by authorities, because the priority for the current phase is to further expand inoculations among adults, due to tight vaccine production capacity.Feng said that China will gradually prompt vaccinations of children, but not all at once, because there is huge demand from both overseas and domestic, as well as preparations for a booster shot.\"China's total vaccine production basically meets the daily administered doses across the nation, about 20 million doses. In some places, vaccines are immediately out of stock on the same day of distribution,\" Feng said.China had administered 777 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines as of Sunday, according to the NHC. - Global Times\n",

      "YANGON (Reuters): The Myanmar junta's foreign minister had defended its plan for restoring democracy, state media reported on Tuesday (June 8), after a meeting at which Southeast Asian counterparts pressed the army to implement a regional agreement meant to end turmoil.The junta has paid little heed to demands from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to respect a \"consensus\" agreed in late April to end violence and hold political talks with its opponents.Southeast foreign ministers expressed disappointment at the meeting in China on Monday at the \"very slow\" progress made by Myanmar on its proposal for ending the turmoil since the army overthrew elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb 1.State media cited junta-appointed foreign minister Wunna Maung Lwin as telling the Asean-China foreign ministers' meeting that the military had made progress on its own five-step roadmap for the country unveiled after its coup.\"The minister apprised the meeting that the only way to ensure the democratic system that is disciplined and genuine was through the five-point future programme that was declared in February,\" the Global New Light of Myanmar reported.The minister had said that most of these points had been met including preventative Covid-19 measures and setting up a new election commission to look into alleged fraud during a November election swept by Suu Kyi's party, the paper said.The military defended its seizure of power after a decade of tentative steps towards democracy saying the old election commission had ignored its complaints of fraud.The junta has failed to impose control since ousting Suu Kyi, who is among more than 4,500 people detained since the coup.The security forces have killed at least 849 protesters, a rights group says, though the army disputes that figure, and insurgencies in several regions have flared.Alarmed by the turmoil, several members of Asean have called for the release of political detainees, an end to the violence and for Myanmar's rivals to hold talks on ending the crisis - calls reflected in the Asean \"consensus\".But in the only reference to the Asean proposal, the Myanmar minister was cited as saying \"discussions were made cordially\" on it during a visit last week by two Asean envoys - who had also called for the release of political prisoners.Opponents of the junta have shown increasing frustration at Asean's inability to press the junta and its failure to include other political stakeholders, particularly the ousted government. The junta has branded its opponents \"terrorists\".China's state-run Global Times newspaper has quoted junta Min Aung Hlaing leader as telling the Chinese ambassador that Myanmar was willing to coordinate implementation of the consensus.After Monday's meeting, Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said Chinese help would be \"highly appreciated as this will contribute to achieving a peaceful solution\".A shadow government formed by anti-coup opponents criticised China's embassy in Myanmar for calling the junta chief the \"leader\" of Myanmar on a posting on its website.\n",

      "MUMBAI (Bloomberg): The coronavirus variant driving India’s devastating Covid-19 second wave is the most infectious to emerge so far. Doctors now want to know if it’s also more severe.Hearing impairment, severe gastric upsets and blood clots leading to gangrene, symptoms not typically seen in Covid patients, have been linked by doctors in India to the so-called delta variant. In England and Scotland, early evidence suggests the strain -- which is also now dominant there -- carries a higher risk of hospitalisation.Delta, also known as B.1.617.2, has spread to more than 60 countries over the past six months and triggered travel curbs from Australia to the US.A spike in infections, fuelled by the delta variant, has forced UK to reconsider its plans for reopening later this month, with a local report saying it may be pushed back by two weeks.Higher rates of transmission and a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines have made understanding the strain’s effects especially critical.\"We need more scientific research to analyse if these newer clinical presentations are linked to B.1.617 or not, ” said Abdul Ghafur, an infectious disease physician at the Apollo Hospital in Chennai, southern India’s largest city. Ghafur said he is seeing more Covid patients with diarrhea now than in the initial wave of the pandemic.\"Last year, we thought we had learned about our new enemy, but it changed, ” Ghafur said.\"This virus has become so, so unpredictable.”Stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hearing loss and joint pain are among the ailments Covid patients are experiencing, according to six doctors treating patients across India.The beta and gamma variants -- first detected in South Africa and Brazil respectively -- have shown little or no evidence of triggering unusual clinical signs, according to a study by researchers from the University of New South Wales last month.Some patients develop micro thrombi, or small blood clots, so severe that they led affected tissue to die and develop gangrene, said Ganesh Manudhane, a Mumbai cardiologist, who has treated eight patients for thrombotic complications at the Seven Hills Hospital during the past two months. Two required amputations of fingers or a foot.\"I saw three-to-four cases the whole of last year, and now it’s one patient a week, ” Manudhane said.India has reported 18.6 million Covid cases thus far in 2021, compared with 10.3 million last year. The delta variant was the \"primary cause” behind the country’s deadlier second wave and is 50% more contagious than the alpha strain that was first spotted in the UK, according to a recent study by an Indian government panel.The surge in cases may have driven an increase in the frequency with which rare Covid complications are being observed. Even still, Manudhane said he is baffled by the blood clots he’s seeing in patients across age groups with no past history of coagulation-related problems.\"We suspect it could be because of the new virus variant, ” he said. Manudhane is collecting data to study why some people develop the clots and others don’t.Doctors are also finding instances of clots forming in blood vessels that supply the intestines, causing patients to experience stomach pain -- their only symptom, local media have reported.Some Covid patients are also seeking medical care for hearing loss, swelling around the neck and severe tonsillitis, said Hetal Marfatia, an ear nose and throat surgeon at Mumbai’s King Edward Memorial Hospital.\"Every person is showing different symptoms” in the second wave, she said.The unusual presentations for delta and a closely related variant known as kappa, whose spread led to a fourth lockdown in the Australian city of Melbourne, are still being confirmed, said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. \"In the meanwhile, it is important to take note of this and be aware of possible atypical presentations, ” she said.The most alarming aspect of the current outbreak in India is the rapidity with which the virus is spreading, including to children, said Chetan Mundada, a paediatrician with the Yashoda group of hospitals in Hyderabad.Apollo’s Ghafur said he was also seeing entire families with Covid symptoms, unlike last year when individuals dominated, reflecting an increase in household transmission caused by the delta variant.Cases of Mucormycosis -- a rare opportunistic fungal infection -- have also been surging in India. It had infected more than 8,800 Covid patients and survivors as of May 22, forcing local health care authorities to call it an epidemic.Even as India’s outbreak begins to ease -- daily infections have slipped to less than a quarter of the May 7 peak -- the delta variant is sparking outbreaks elsewhere, including hitherto virus havens such as Taiwan, Singapore and Vietnam, bolstering calls for mass immunisation.German politician and scientist Karl Lauterbach said Tuesday the variant will probably become more prevalent in Germany too in the coming months.\"To avoid it completely seems unrealistic to me, ” he said on Twitter in German.\"The decisive factor is a very high vaccination rate, which reduces mortality.”But with emerging evidence delta and at least one other variant may be adept at evading vaccine-induced antibodies, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to tweak existing shots or develop new ones.\"New vaccines have to prepared with new variants in mind, ” said Ghafur.\"We can’t get ahead of the virus, but at least we can least keep up with it.”\n",

Papasok po ‘yan sa murder sapagkat intentional, ” Panelo said.(If the person knows he has coronavirus yet he still went out and managed to infect another individual which led to their death, that’s intentional killing. It is within the ambit of murder because it’s intentional.)Duterte, in response, said reckless imprudence would still be the best complaint against these persons though he agreed that a murder case is “possible.”“Iyong sabi mo murder, although medyo malayo masyado sa isip ng tao ‘yan, but it is possible. If he knows that he is sick with COVID-19 and he goes about nonchalant, papasyal-pasyal ka lang diyan, you are maybe, if it is intentional, malayo ‘yan pero it could be murder, sabi nga ni Sal, ” Duterte said.(What you said about murder, this is far from what the people think, but it is possible. If he knows that he is sick with COVID-19 and he goes about nonchalant, going around here and there, if it is intentional, that’s far but it could be murder as what Sal said.)“At kung hindi, iyang reckless imprudence would really mas swak doon sa sitwasyon na ‘yon, ” he added.(But if now, reckless imprudence would be the most fit for the situation.)\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) has posted its highest quarterly gross investment income of RM19.29bil for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021 amid the uncertainties from the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.It was a 58.63% jump year-on-year (y-o-y) from RM12.16bil last year and a 17.84% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) increase as compared to RM16.37bil for the three-month period ended Dec 31, 2020.The latest quarterly gross investment income alone surpassed the full year performance of 2009 and its preceding years.The stellar performance came mainly from equities, which accounted for RM14.28bil or 74% of the gross investment income while fixed income instruments contributed a stable income of RM3.92bil.Income from real estate and infrastructure, as well as money market instruments, came in at RM710mil and RM380mil respectively.After the cost write-down on listed equities, which is a prudent measure practiced by the EPF to ensure that its long-term investment portfolio remains healthy, the fund recorded a net investment income of RM19.24bil.EPF chief executive officer Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan (file pic above) said the fund’s solid performance for the first quarter was a spillover from the global economic recovery that began in the second-half of last year.“We believe that the vaccination rollouts as well as supportive fiscal and monetary policies worldwide will play a key role in facilitating economic activities and growth.“The inflationary concerns did not derail the positive trend in the equity markets and we took advantage of the opportunity to reposition our holdings in stocks that are fundamentally strong but undervalued, ” he said in a statement.Amir added that while the EPF remains cautious for the coming quarter given the downside risks of the new highly transmissible Covid-19 variants, he assured members that the EPF continuously take the necessary measures to protect members’ savings, supported by its strong governance framework as it strives to meet the mandate and strategic targets of providing members with a sustainable retirement.“Our disciplined investment approach and robust liquidity management guided by the Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) has been successful in minimising the impact of the substantial disbursements on the EPF’s portfolio, allowing it to sustain a steady performance in these trying times.“This reflects the fund’s commitment to safeguarding our members’ retirement savings by preserving and enhancing the value of those savings, while ensuring that their short-term needs are met without compromising their long-term interests, ” he said.EPF’s investment assets stood at RM981.71bil as at end March 2021, of which 36% was invested overseas.The diversification in different asset classes, markets, and currencies continued to provide income stability and added value to the fund’s overall returns.During the first quarter, the EPF’s overseas investments generated an income of RM11.15bil, or 58% of the total gross investment income recorded, mainly driven by foreign equities.By asset class, fixed income instruments made up 46% of investments while equities comprised 44%.Money market instruments and real estate and infrastructure made up 4% and 6% respectively of investments.EPF said the portfolio reflected its diversification strategy to optimise returns within tolerable risk limits as guided by the SAA, which has proven to be resilient in the face of any challenging market environment, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.To date, a total of RM57.97bil of i-Sinar withdrawals have been approved for 6.49 million applicants, out of which RM50.93bil have been disbursed, while RM20.80bil has been paid out to 5.27 million members under the i-Lestari facility.EPF’s i-Sinar and iLestari facilities were introduced last year to allow affected members to make withdrawals that would help provide some measure of financial relief.Riding on the expectations of a global recovery this year, Socio-Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie told StarBiz that 2021 would be a better year from a macro perspective in terms of sustainable global recovery and global equity markets’ performance.“Countries like the United States are showing steady signs of recovery from the pandemic and that will help to support the global equity markets.“It is indeed a very good start in 2021 for the EPF with the jump in gross investment income that largely came from equities, about half from overseas investments.“Hopefully, this set of numbers registered in the first quarter can be sustained throughout the year, underpinned by the income from EPF’s foreign equity portion, ” he said, adding that this would also have a positive spillover of the domestic equity market.Despite the periodic volatilities on the back of concerns of the rising Covid-19 cases in recent weeks that led to a lockdown, Lee said the benchmark index FBM KLCI is still holding on.While these may tamper the macro outlook and some recovery play stocks, he noted that there would not be any significant impact on the overall domestic equity market.“It is still very much dependent on the overseas performance, particularly the Dow Jones, ” he said.\n",

      "HONG KONG: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s cloud division has pledged US$1bil (RM4.1bil) to support startups in Asia, marking one of its largest outlays since the tech giant pledged to boost spending and move past a bruising antitrust investigation at home.The US$1bil (RM4.1bil) will be the initial funding for Project AsiaForward, which aims to nurture 100, 000 developers and tech startups over the next three years, Alibaba said in a statement yesterday.The company aims to build a million-strong talent pool by providing training for developers, as well as connecting entrepreneurs with venture capital and other opportunities.Jack Ma’s e-commerce titan said last month it will invest all incremental profits into areas like technology and e-commerce, after Chinese antitrust regulators imposed a record US$2.8bil (RM11.49bil) fine that drove the firm to its first quarterly loss in nine years.Chinese tech giants from Alibaba to Tencent Holdings Ltd and Meituan have all pledged to dramatically boost spending, as Beijing’s crackdown on the industry forces companies to find new growth drivers.“We are seeing a strong demand for cloud-native technologies in emerging verticals across the region, from e-commerce and logistics platforms to fintech and online entertainment, ” Jeff Zhang, president of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence, said in the statement.“Our focus on innovation and data center investments, as well as talent development is in anticipation of a digital-first future.”Alibaba’s cloud business, modeled on Amazon Web Services, grew from the needs of its massive online shopping operation to become one of the e-commerce giant’s biggest growth engines.But its expansion is slowing in the wake of competition from Tencent and Huawei Technologies Co.Its cloud revenue rose just 37% in the March quarter, the slowest pace since 2014, after a major customer pulled out.ByteDance Ltd’s viral video service TikTok decided to drop Alibaba as a cloud provider during the period and instead relied more on its own inhouse servers and American rivals such as AWS, a person familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified talking about a private decision.Alibaba Cloud is opening its first data centre in the Philippines by the end of this year and will build an innovation centre in Malaysia. Currently operating in 75 so-called availability zones in 24 regions, the firm has also launched a third data centre in Indonesia. — BloombergIt was the No. 3 Infrastructure-as-a-Service, or IaaS cloud provider globally in 2020, behind Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, according to industry researcher Gartner.“Our strategic roadmap for Apac includes targeted investments to facilitate the digital transformation of local businesses, ” Selina Yuan, general manager of Alibaba Cloud Intelligence’s international business unit, said in the statement. “We see these investments as all the more timely given the impact of the pandemic and the sharp rise in demand for digital business tools.”Fierce rival Tencent said last week it’s launching four data centres in Bangkok, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Tokyo, giving its cloud business a presence in 27 regions worldwide. -- Bloomberg\n",

      "Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc invested US$500 million in Brazil's Nubank, giving the fast-growing fintech a big vote of confidence as it seeks to widen its footprint across Latin America.Nubank, best known as a credit card issuer, also said it raised an additional $250 million from a series of other investors.The new investments give Nubank a $30 billion valuation, up from $25 billion at the time of its previous fundraising round, according to a source familiar with the situation. That would make the upstart bank worth just slightly less than Banco Santander Brasil SA, Brazil's No. 3 bank, which has more than 2, 000 branches.The transaction also vaults Nubank into the upper echelons of fintechs worldwide, on a par with brokerage startup Robinhood Markets Inc and China's Lufax but still far behind Ant Group.Nubank, which has 40 million clients, said in a statement it plans to use the proceeds to fund its international expansion to Mexico and Colombia, launch new products and services and hire more employees.The arrival of such high-profile investors, who usually invest in publicly traded companies, gives a hint on how close Nubank is to a listing.Earlier in April, Reuters reported that Nubank had initiated preparations for a U.S. stock market listing which could come as early as this year, according to sources familiar with the matter.BERKSHIRE BETS IN BRAZILNubank is Warren Buffett's second bet on a Brazilian financial startup. His Berkshire Hathaway also acquired a stake in payments company StoneCo Ltd almost three years ago, when it went public.A highly concentrated financial market, in which the five top lenders hold almost 78% of the country's total assets, Brazil has been a hotbed for fintech growth. Online banking has reduced costs for newcomers and the central bank has created new rules to encourage competition, aiming at lower fees and interest rates for consumers.Nubank's $750 million new funding round is part of its series G fundraising round, which totaled $1.15 billion. An initial part of the series G round was announced in January.Other participants in the round included Sands Capital, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, MSA Capital, Advent's Sunley House Capital and Brazilian asset managers Verde Asset Management and Absoluto Partners.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Plantation company Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK) is expected to launch a takeover bid of IJM Plantations Bhd (IJMP) after the shares of both companies were suspended from trading in the afternoon session of trading yesterday.IJM Corp Bhd, which has a 56.2% stake in subsidiary IJMP, was also suspended from trading as it prepares to announce a corporate proposal involving IJMP.A potential acquisition of IJMP by KLK could see the latter’s total combined plantation land bank rising to almost 336, 000ha, according to information obtained from the respective companies’ website.IJMP has 60, 966ha in total planted area in Sabah, east Kalimantan and Sumatra. The planter has a relatively young palm age profile in its operations in Indonesia.KLK, which is one of Malaysia’s largest plantation companies, has close to 275, 000ha across the peninsula, Sabah, Belitung island, Sumatra, central and east Kalimantan in Indonesia and LiberiaWhen contacted by StarBiz, analysts declined to comment until more details of the transaction are announced by today.Both companies’ shares rose prior to their trading suspension at 2.30pm yesterday.IJMP gained 11.82% to RM2.46 with 5.69 million shares changing hands while KLK also posted a gain at a smaller quantum of 0.74% or 16 sen with 117, 300 shares changing hands at midday trade.“Crude palm oil (CPO) prices have been in the spotlight this year, given the rally alongside other global commodities.“With the rise in CPO prices to historic highs, plantation companies have seen their fortunes rising, ” said an observer.As the US dollar weakness continues on the global front, commodity prices, including CPO, have been trending on the upside.KLK reported that its second quarter net profit ended March 31, had risen some 17 times to RM490.44mil from RM27.89mil in the same quarter a year ago.The strong results by KLK were mainly driven by higher profits from its plantation, manufacturing and property development segments.With such strong returns, industry observers noted that it came as no surprise that KLK, with deep pockets, would resume its acquisition trail. KLK has been on an active acquisition mode over the past few years.Last year, KLK’s indirect unit Taiko Plantations Pte Ltd (TPPL) acquired TSH Resources Bhd’s 90% stakes in its subsidiaries in Indonesia for US$109.23mil (RM450mil).The transaction saw TSH Resources realising cash proceeds of RM517.62mil that went toward paring down its debt.KLK had, in 2018, also acquired a 95% stake in an Indonesian oil palm company, PT Putra Bongan Jaya which has plantations in East Kalimantan for about RM300mil.Yesterday, the third benchmark CPO futures contract for August closed RM88 lower to RM4, 049 per tonne.Early last month, the CPO price have risen to a historical high of almost RM4, 700 per tonne as the markets priced-in and were looking forward to an economic recovery post-Covid 19.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The digitalisation of government services would serve to curb leakages, fraud and corruption within the public sector, according to Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz.He said that by moving the traditional government services online, it will reduce direct contact points between citizens and public officials, and hence minimise chances for corruption to occur.In addition, the digitalisation efforts would also modernise public service delivery, enhance efficiency and expedite direct government assistance to ensure inclusiveness, accessibility, transparency and accountability.“So far, direct aids have been done mostly on a cashless basis, where applications and payments for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat and Geran Khas Prihatin are made electronically and online.“In the near future, under MyDigital, the Finance Ministry will ensure payments for all government services by 2022 are made on a cashless basis.“This will lead to higher transactional security, better coordination, enhanced communication on anti-corruption initiatives and greater ease of sharing information, ” Tengku Zafrul said.He was speaking at the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) International Accountants Conference 2021 held virtually yesterday. In his remarks, Tengku Zafrul expressed his appreciation to MIA, among others, for its advocacy on sustainability and the environment, social and governance (ESG) principles.Meanwhile, in a separate panel session that featured economists Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid(pic below) and Prof Jomo Kwame Sundaram, the topic of taxation in the post-pandemic world was discussed.Jomo said the government should begin discussing greater tax reforms and the introduction of new taxes.“Unfortunately, in countries like Malaysia, there has been very little public discussion about how to improve taxation.“There are two major challenges, one is to have much greater tax collection.“We have a huge problem there because we have many leakages and other problems with the system.“There needs to be a unified tax system in Malaysia. Why do you have a customs authority that is completely unintegrated with the Inland Revenue authority?“The other challenge is the progressiveness of the taxation system. We need a far more comprehensive, equitable and progressive view in reforming the system, ” he said.Jomo (pic below) pointed out that there is a possibility for the government to generate additional revenue by imposing windfall and other capital gains taxes, although he said the tax proceeds “won’t be very much”.Meanwhile, Mohd Afzanizam said the Covid-19 pandemic had accentuated the level of inequality in society, making it more difficult for the government to prescribe a new taxation system.“Nevertheless, this crisis has opened up opportunities for the policy makers to rethink what are the best means to not just raise revenues, but also to redistribute wealth between the rich and the poor.“Obviously, taxation is one of the mechanisms but the philanthropy economy such as donations or in the case of Islamic economy, waqf (endowment), is something that we need to look at more seriously at the moment, ” said Mohd Afzanizam.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The recent acquisition from Repsol Exploración, S.A. would give Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd a boost in earnings and see a notable impact on its production.Last week, the oil and gas exploration and production company said it has acquired Spanish energy major Repsol’s upstream assets in Malaysia and Vietnam for a cash consideration of US$212.5mil (RM875.71mil).It comprises five production-sharing contracts (PSC) with Vietnam being a new market for Hibiscus.Public Investment Bank Research (PublicInvest Research) said these assets are expected to increase the group’s production rate including gas to 26, 800 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/day) with oil production rate to increase from 9, 000 barrels per day bbls/day to 18, 500 barrels per day.“With this acquisition, the group is almost set towards achieving its target to produce 20, 000 barrels per day of oil by 2021.“We understand that there are two more bids that are still on-going, though management indicates there is no rush for the other new assets for now, ” it said in a report after an investor briefing over the weekend, where Hibiscus’ management provided more details pertaining to the acquisition from Repsol.Overall, it said the deal is timely in light of the favourable oil price environment with significant impact to the group’s production and earnings immediately upon its completion.“Earnings momentum will also be supported by the current favourable oil price at above US$60 (RM247.29) barrels of crude oil. “We adjust our earnings forecasts for financial years ending June 30, 2022 (FY22) and FY23 accordingly, seeing the group’s bottom line enhanced by around 149.3%/ 250.5%, with an incremental value to our discounted cash flow-based valuation of 52 sen based on a 10% discount rate.“Our target price revised to RM1.05 (from 76 sen previously) on a fully diluted basis, incorporating RM200mil new issuance of convertible redeemable preference shares with conversion price of 60 sen, ” PublicInvest Research said.Meanwhile, BIMB Securities Research said the purchase price, which implies an acquisition cost of about US$6.2 (RM25.55) boe is fair given the rising oil price.On top of previous remaining redeemable convertible preference shares’ proceeds of about RM197mil, it said the company expects it will require to raise additional RM200mil from private placement of RCPS and borrowings - if required - to settle the purchase.Subsequently, there is RM1.6bil RCPS remaining to be issued for future acquisitions, the research firm noted.Following the completion of the sales and purchase agreement (SPA), Hibiscus is required to undertake at least three drilling projects including one exploration and two developments at Kinabalu PSC and PM3 CAA areas.The total expected capital expenditure for these projects amount to US$110mil (RM453.42mil), which will be funded through cash flows from the asset.As for earnings, BIMB Securities said it raised its FY22/FY23 earnings forecast by 35%/191% to account for these assets, assuming the SPA completion by the second quarter of FY22 and oil price assumption of US$60 (RM247.29).\n",

      "WASHINGTON: U.S. job openings surged by nearly one million to a new record high in April, while more people voluntarily left their employment, strengthening the view that a recent moderation in job growth was due to supply constraints.The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report, on Tuesday also showed layoffs hit a record low in April. Millions of unemployed Americans remain at home because of trouble securing child care, generous unemployment benefits and lingering fears over COVID-19 even as vaccines are widely accessible and the pandemic is subsiding.\"The evidence continues to grow that the lackluster job creation of recent months is a result of constraints on labor supply and that the labor market is tight,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital in New York.Job openings, a measure of labor demand, increased by 998, 000 to 9.3 million on the last day of April, the highest level since the series began in December 2000. Vacancies rose in all four regions and were spread across nearly all industries as well as the government sector.Unfilled jobs in the accommodation and food services increased by 349, 000. There were an additional 115, 000 job openings in other services, while vacancies at manufacturers of long-lasting goods increased 78, 000. But job openings decreased in educational services and mining and logging industry.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast job openings would rise to 8.3 million in April. The job openings rate shot up to an all-time high of 6.0% from 5.4% in March.Hiring inched up to 6.1 million in April from 6.0 million in the prior month. The government reported last Friday that job growth picked up in May, with employers raising wages, but the pace of hiring was below economists' expectations for a second straight month.Companies are struggling to find workers even as about 9.3 million people are officially unemployed. Economists expect the labor market disconnect will be resolved in the fall. Government-funded unemployment benefits will end in early September. Republican governors in 25 states, accounting for more than 40% of the workforce, are ending federal government unemployment benefits, including a $300 weekly subsidy, starting on Saturday.Schools are set to fully reopen in the fall and more people are expected to be vaccinated against COVID-19. At least half of the adult American population is fully inoculated.The JOLTS report also showed 384, 000 people voluntarily quit their jobs in April, lifting the total to a record 4.0 million. About 106, 000 retail workers left their jobs, while professional and business services saw 94, 000 resignations.In the transportation, warehousing and utilities industry, 49, 000 workers quit. The number of quits rose in the South, Midwest and West regions. The quits rate increased to an all-time high of 2.7% from 2.5% in March.The quits rate is normally viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. But nearly 1.8 million women have left the labor force since February 2020 mostly because of problems related to child care.With willing workers scarce, layoffs and discharges dropped by 81, 000 to a record low 1.4 million. There was a 0.95 open job per unemployed person in April. Rising job openings and voluntary quits could pressure employers to raise wages.Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were higher.TRADE GAP NARROWSA separate report from the Commerce Department on Tuesday showed the reopening economy was leading to a shift in domestic demand back to services from goods, with the trade deficit retreating from a record high in April as imports fell.The trade deficit dropped 8.2% to $68.9 billion in April. The gap widened to a record $75.0 billion in March. Economists had forecast a $69.0 billion trade deficit.Goods imports dropped 1.9% to $232.0 billion. The decline was led by a $2.6 billion drop in imports of consumer goods, which reflected decreases in textile apparel, toys, games and sporting goods as well as household appliances. Imports of motor vehicles, parts and engines also fell.But imports of cell phones and other household goods increased. Imports of foods, feeds and beverages were the highest on record as were of those of capital goods. Imports of services increased $0.7 billion to $41.9 billion in April. They were lifted by travel and transport services.\"With the pandemic coming under control, consumers are redirecting their spending towards domestically produced services and away from imports,\" said Bill Adams, a senior economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Exports of goods gained 1.1% to a record $145.3 billion, boosted shipments of civilian aircraft. Exports of industrial supplies and materials were the highest on record, with crude oil shipments rising $1.0 billion. But exports of motor vehicles, parts and engines fell. Auto production has been hit by a global semiconductor shortage.Exports of foods, feeds and beverages were the highest on record. Exports of services increased $0.7 billion amid small gains in travel, transport and charges for the use of intellectual property.At $17.8 billion in April, the services surplus was the smallest since August 2012. Exports are likely to continue rising as global economic growth gains momentum.When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $7.2 billion to $98.6 billion in April.Trade was a drag on gross domestic product growth in the first quarter. Most economists expect double-digit GDP growth this quarter, after the economy grew at a 6.4% annualized rate in the third quarter.- Reuters\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: FGV Holdings Bhd’s unit FGV Integrated Farming Holdings Sdn Bhd (FGVIF) had on Tuesday signed an agreement to buy the entire 100 per cent equity interest in MSM Perlis Sdn Bhd, which owns about 4,500 hectares in Chuping, Perlis, for RM175 million.MSM Perlis is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MSM Malaysia Holdings Bhd (MSM), which in turn is 51 per cent owned by the FGV group.The share sales agreement is in continuation to the binding term sheet previously signed between MSM and FGVIF on April 30, 2021.\"The disposal is following the discontinuation of non-strategic operations in MSM Perlis as part of MSM’s rationalisation strategies to streamline profitability and develop operational capability.\"MSM will be conducting an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to obtain approval from its shareholders which is scheduled by the third quarter of 2021. The transaction is targeted to complete before the end of the year,” FGV and MSM said in a joint statement today.MSM group chief executive officer Syed Feizal Syed Mohammad said an extraordinary income would be realised as part of the proposed disposal with an estimated gain of RM91.6 million.\"It is also to enhance our operational front particularly on utilisation factor and yield improvement in MSM Sugar Refinery (Johor) Sdn Bhd (MSM Johor).\"Aside from the disposal, the accelerated planned rectification works at MSM Johor will also support MSM’s target to reach a minimum UF rate of 50 percent by the third quarter of the year,” Syed Feizal said.Meanwhile, FGV has earmarked the 11 parcels of agricultural and industrial land owned by MSM Perlis for the development of the FGV Chuping Agro Valley (FCAV) by FGVIF, a new sector under the group.The development would consist of high-value integrated cash crop plantation activities such as MD2 pineapples and harumanis mangoes, as well as dairy farming, it said.FGV Group’s officer-in-charge and group divisional director of logistics and support businesses sector, Azman Ahmad, said the group was looking forward to the development and expansion of the FCAV project in order to realise FGVIF’s strategic initiatives.\"This is in line with the government’s proposition to bolster the domestic economic sector and provide employment opportunities in efforts to reduce the impact of the pandemic,” he said.To date, the group has hired more than 50 employees and field workers for the project, and in addition, a total area of 60 hectares have been allocated for the agropreneurs programme under the contract farming scheme for the MD2 pineapple project.\"The first batch of agropreneurs recruitment is expected to be in July 2021.\"FGVIF has already commenced the ground work of 1,200 hectares of MD2 pineapple plantation where we target to complete the development by the year 2025,” added Azman.Since the cessation of sugar cane plantation, MSM Perlis continued to manage the agricultural land with rubber, oil palm and mango plantations, but due to unsustainable performance associated with high operating costs of maintaining plantation activities, it ceased the plantation sector on June 30, 2019.Meanwhile, MSM Perlis’ sugar refinery operations were discontinued a year later following MSM’s capacity rationalisation to consolidate the production in the new refinery, MSM Johor.The unfavourable location of MSM Perlis (distance from ports), its small capacity and high-cost facility had caused the operations to be uneconomical, the statement said. - Bernama\n",

We could see much lower prices before they go up again,\" said analyst Daniel Briesemann at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.If a downturn was steep, prices could go as low as $8, 000 a tonne, he added.Copper has retreated since touching a record peak of $10, 747.50 last month, but is still up 29% year to date, fuelled by speculation that a green revolution would spur new demand.\"Copper will be in high demand for future technology, but this will be a driver in a few years, not in the next few months,\" Briesemann said.Shanghai copper prices closed 0.4% lower at 71, 420 yuan, as fears of U.S. monetary policy tightening and softer demand in top consumer China pressured prices.The Yangshan copper premium was last at $28 a tonne, hovering around its lowest since February 2016 and down 75% from May 2020, indicating weakening demand for imported metal in China.* Indonesia aims for three nickel smelters to be completed and operational this year, a government official said.* LME cash aluminium moved to a 50 cent a tonne premium to the three-month contract, the first premium in a month, indicating nearby LME supplies are tightening.* LME aluminium rose 1% to $2, 449.50 a tonne, nickel added 0.3% to $17, 945, zinc climbed 0.5% to $3, 013.50, lead advanced 1.4% to $2, 184 and tin gained 2.1% at $31, 160, after touching a decade-high of $31, 470.- Reuters\n",

      "NEW YORK/LONDON: A global equity benchmark and two key European stock indexes touched new highs on Tuesday, while the dollar rose in anticipation of faster inflation as volatility eased to lows last seen before the coronavirus pandemic.Yields on U.S. Treasury debt fell to their lowest in more than a month, while euro zone bond yields nudged down with markets in a wait-and-see mood ahead of a European Central Bank policy meeting and U.S. inflation data, both due on Thursday.The 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 3.4 basis points to 1.5364%, suggesting bond investors do not see a spike in inflation despite nagging jitters over the Federal Reserve's insistence a likely jump in consumer prices will be transient.Markets have been quiet before the release of second-quarter earnings in July when very strong results will be reported as a year ago they were so dismal, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.\"Knowing there's a strong earnings season coming takes away some worry,\" Tuz said, keeping share prices from falling. \"The markets are about as flat and quiet as they can be today.\"MSCI's all-country world index, a U.S.-centric benchmark for global equity markets, closed down 0.01% at 716.96 after earlier scaling a fresh intraday high of 718.19.In Europe, the pan FTSEurofirst 300 index added 0.08% to close at a new record high, while the STOXX 600 index rose 0.15% to also set a new closing high.Telecoms, travel and real estate shares in Europe led equity markets higher, but weak German industrial output data and doubts that Britain will lift remaining pandemic restrictions later this month capped gains.The travel and leisure index rose 1.8%, supported largely by gains in low-cost carrier easyJet after Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to \"buy.\"The three major Wall Street indexes rose, with the big tech FAANG stocks leading shares higher as the outlook for lower inflation makes their long-term earnings more valuable.\"We've seen the FAANGs creep their way back in reaction to people buying into the inflation-is-transitory story,\" said Simon Maughan, head of trading alpha at Liquident, an alternative trading venue.Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc rose while Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc fell.Advancing shares outnumbered declining shares on both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, while growth-oriented shares slightly outpaced the gains of underpriced value stocks.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.09%, the S&P 500 gained 0.02% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.31%.Shares in electric carmaker Tesla retreated 0.3% after rising earlier on data from Beijing that showed its Chinese sales - which comprise a third of the firm's total sales - had seen a 29% leap last month.The data had also showed China's overall new electric vehicle sales had surged 177% compared with a year ago.In a sign of investor complacency, the equity market's so-called \"fear gauge,\" the VIX, fell to as low as 15.15, a level not seen since February 2020.Sterling was under pressure as the British government considered whether to delay removing most of its remaining coronavirus restrictions and oil was in the doldrums, but both looked like being temporary phenomena at worst.Recent comments suggested the European Central Bank has no plans to reel in its mass stimulus program any time soon.\"I would expect the ECB to maintain a dovish stance as they would not be want to be seen as moving towards tapering at the moment,\" said Lombard Odier, head of FX strategy at Vasileios Gkionakis.The dollar index rose 0.148%, with the euro down 0.13% to $1.2173. The Japanese yen weakened 0.22% versus the greenback at 109.49 per dollar.U.S. gold futures settled down 0.2% at $1, 894.40 an ounce.Brent crude futures settled up 73 cents at $72.22 a barrel. U.S. crude futures rose 82 cents to settle at $70.05 a barrel.Overnight in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 had inched down 0.2% as losses in market heavyweights offset gains for drugmakers after Eisai Co's Alzheimer's drug received U.S. regulatory approval.In the U.S.Wall Street stocks struggled to eke out closing gains on Tuesday as a lack of clear market catalysts kept institutional investors on the sidelines, while retail traders fueled the ongoing meme stocks rally.All three major U.S. stock indexes ended the range-bound session near flat or higher, with the S&P 500 and the Dow closing within about 0.5% of record highs.The tech-laded Nasdaq Composite fared best, with Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc providing the biggest boost.\"We're waiting for inflation numbers, waiting for more from the (Federal Reserve), waiting for earnings season,\" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. \"There's not a lot motivating the market today.\"\"We're in this twilight zone until probably right after the Fourth of July, when we see earnings season kick in,\" Nolte added.The CBOE volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, touched its lowest level in over a year.Smallcaps, once again buoyed by the ongoing meme stock retail frenzy, were outperforming their larger counterparts.Clover Health Investments seized top billing among meme stocks, surging 85.8%, the biggest percentage winner in the Nasdaq.Other stocks whose recent explosive trading volumes have been attributed to social media buzz, including GameStop Corp , Bed Bath & Beyond Inc, Workhorse Group and others, ended the session between 7% and 12% higher.\"(Meme stocks) are where the action is, but you flip it over and look crypto and that's a mess,\" Nolte said. \"Now the meme stocks are taking over from crypto as the place to be and it's all a consequence of very easy monetary policy.\"Reports from the U.S. Labor Department and National Federation of Independent Business appeared to confirm a labor shortage even as demand roars back to life, which could put upward pressure on wages, a precursor to wider inflation.Market participants look to Thursday's consumer price index data for further clues regarding inflation, and how it could influence the Federal Reserve's timetable for tightening its monetary policy.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 30.42 points, or 0.09%, to 34,599.82; the S&P 500 gained 0.74 points, or 0.02%, at 4,227.26; and the Nasdaq Composite added 43.19 points, or 0.31%, at 13,924.91.Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, consumer discretionary enjoyed the biggest percentage gain, and utilities suffered the largest loss.Sales of Tesla Inc's China-made electric cars jumped in May by 29%, marking a 177% year-on-year increase, according to the China Passenger Car Association. The stock erased initial gains on the news to close down 0.3%.Boeing Co shares were boosted by Southwest Airlines' announcement that it had ordered 34 new 737 MAX aircraft, but the planemaker's shares pared gains to end the session flat.GameStop, the company most closely associated with the Reddit-driven short squeeze phenomenon, is expected to report quarterly results after markets close on Wednesday.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.66-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 54 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 172 new highs and 16 new lows.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.82 billion shares, compared with the 10.75 billion average over the last 20 trading days.- Reuters\n",

      "NEW YORK: Oil prices rose on Tuesday, settling at the highest in more than two years after the top U.S. diplomat said that even if the United States were to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, hundreds of U.S. sanctions on Tehran would remain in place.That could mean additional Iranian oil supply would not be re-introduced into the market soon.\"I would anticipate that even in the event of a return to compliance with the JCPOA (2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), hundreds of sanctions will remain in place, including sanctions imposed by the Trump administration,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.Brent crude rose 73 cents, or 1%, to close at US$72.22 a barrel, the highest it has settled since May 2019. U.S. West Texas Intermediate oil rose 82 cents, or 1.2%, to settle at $70.05 a barrel, highest since October 2018.\"Blinken is looking at the reality of the situation and saying even if we do get a deal, there’s a long way to go,\" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. \"All those people expecting a flood of oil are going to be disappointed.\"The United States told Iran on Tuesday that it must let the U.N. atomic agency continue to monitor its activities, as laid out in an agreement that has been extended until June 24, or put wider talks on reviving the Iran nuclear deal at risk.Barriers to the revival of Iran's nuclear deal remain ahead of talks due to resume this week between Tehran and world powers, four diplomats, two Iranian officials and two analysts told Reuters.Futures were pressured by data showing China's crude imports were down 14.6% in May from a year earlier.Crude prices have risen in recent weeks, with Brent up by nearly 40% this year and WTI even more on expectations of demand returning as some countries vaccinate populations against COVID-19.Restraint on supply by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies has also buttressed prices.U.S. crude oil production is expected to fall by 230, 000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 to 11.08 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said, a smaller decline than it forecast last month.U.S. crude inventories fell by 2.1 million barrels last week, two market sources said after settlement, citing American Petroleum Institute figures. Gasoline inventories rose by 2 million barrels and distillate stocks climbed by 3.8 million barrels.\"The fundamental environment on the oil market remains favourable: fuel demand is recovering strongly not only in the United States, but also in Europe following the (partial) lifting of restrictions,\" Commerzbank said.Some still question the demand recovery's trajectory. For instance, some doubt Britain, one of the most vaccinated countries in the world, will lift all restrictions as previously planned on June 21.- Reuters\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: The rating on Genting Bhd Genting; BBB/Negative/--) will come under further pressure if the lockdown in Malaysia and capacity restrictions in Singapore are extended, says S&P Global Ratings, as Genting cannot offset the impact through other financial means.“Genting's delayed recovery in operations and elevated capital expenditures continue to offer thin rating headroom over the next 12-18 months.“The recovery of the company's debt-to-earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) ratio to below three times and ratio of funds from operations to debt to over 30% could be pushed beyond 2022, if lockdown and capacity restrictions persist, ” it said in a statement on Tuesday.S&P said the recently imposed lockdown in Malaysia and capacity curb in Genting's two key operating countries, will likely weaken earnings and operating cash flow for the rest of first-half 2021, adding further pressure on its credit quality.While confirmed cases in Malaysia trending down from over 7, 000 daily in early June, Genting's operations for 2021 may not recover to S&P's level of expectations unless vaccination rate speeds up significantly in Malaysia.Malaysia's interstate travelling ban has already lowered the company's first-quarter 2021 revenue and Ebitda by 26% and 54%, respectively, compared with fourth-quarter 2020.“Nevertheless, we believe the grand opening of Resorts World Las Vegas LLC (RWLV; BBB-/Negative/--) later this month will support Genting's diverse business mix and soften current operational headwinds in Southeast Asia.“Visitations to Las Vegas Strip had recovered to about 70% of pre-pandemic levels in April 2021. Furthermore, the high proportion of fully vaccinated individuals in the U.S. at 42% has reduced the anxieties around Covid-19 and is supportive of RWLV's business ramp-up for the rest of 2021, ” it said.S&P said similarly, revenue from Genting's New York operations in the first quarter of 2021 returned to 70% of pre-pandemic levels and the US operations could now recover faster than we had expected given operating hours normalized from April.Genting's UK operations also restarted in mid-May after a long closure since the middle of last year.“We believe Genting is striving to control its negative discretionary cash flow by adding flexibility in its investment plans and contemplating plans to dispose non-core assets.“Following the completion of its Malaysian theme park and RWLV, its main pending project is the Resorts World Sentosa 2.0 expansion.“While this would continue to elevate the company's investment plans, we expect the timing and level of investments to be partly dependent on current operational conditions. The group's large cash balance will support its ongoing expansionary spending and periods of negative discretionary cash flows, ” it said.Genting's asset disposal plans include Genting Malaysia Bhd.'s (BBB/Negative/--) planned disposal of a U.K. hotel, which we expect to be completed in the first half of this year.The rating agency said the report does not constitute a rating action.\n",

IJM rose 11 sen to RM1.90 and IJM Plantations jumped 26 sen to RM2.46.In the nine months ended March 31,2021, the plantations business was a huge contributor to IJM Corporation, which is involved in infrastructure, plantations and property.CGS-CIMB Equities Research said in its recent research note IJM Corp’s reported net profit of RM432mil in the nine months included RM85.2mil gain on disposal of investment properties and RM82.4mil forex gains for the plantation division.“Stripping these and other one-off items out, estimated core net profit of RM335mil exceeded our and consensus full-year forecasts by 28-40%.“The key deviation was strong plantation earnings due to higher crude palm oil (CPO) prices, higher core EBITDA margin of 22% vs. our forecast of 8.9% and lower tax rates.

      "KUALA LUMPUR: The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) recorded a gross investment income of RM19.29bil in the first quarter ended March 31, despite uncertainties from Covid-19.In a statement Tuesday, the retirement fund said equities registered RM14.28bil in income during the quarter, accounting for 74% of total gross investment income, while fixed income instruments continued to contribute a stable income of RM3.92bil.Income from real estate and infrastructure, as well as money market instruments, contributed RM710mil and RM380mil, respectively.It said after the cost write-down on listed equities, which was a prudent measure practiced by the EPF to ensure that its long-term investment portfolio remains healthy, the fund recorded a net investment income of RM19.24bil.“EPF’s solid performance for the first quarter was a spillover from the global economic recovery that began in the second-half of last year.“We believe that the vaccination rollouts, as well as supportive fiscal and monetary policies worldwide, will play a key role in facilitating economic activities and growth,” CEO Datuk Seri Amir Hamzah Azizan said.He said inflationary concerns did not derail the positive trend in the equity markets, and the EPF took advantage of the opportunity to reposition holdings in stocks that were fundamentally strong but undervalued.The EPF’s investment assets stood at RM981.71bil as at end-March 2021, of which 36% was invested overseas. The diversification in different asset classes, markets, as well as currencies, continues to provide income stability and added value to the fund’s overall returns.During the first quarter, its overseas investments generated an income of RM11.15bil, or 58% of the total gross investment income recorded, mainly driven by foreign equities.By asset class, fixed income instruments made up 46% of investments, while equities comprised 44%.Money market instruments and real estate and infrastructure made up 4%and 6%, respectively, of investments.The portfolio reflects the EPF’s diversification strategy to optimise returns within tolerable risk limits as guided by the Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA).To date, a total of RM57.97bil of i-Sinar withdrawals have been approved for 6.49 million applicants, out of which RM50.93bil have been disbursed, while RM20.80bil has been paid out to 5.27 million members under the i-Lestari facility.Amir said EPF’s disciplined investment approach and robust liquidity management guided by the SAA has been successful in minimising the impact of the substantial disbursements on the EPF’s portfolio, allowing it to sustain a steady performance in trying times.\"This reflects the fund’s commitment to safeguarding our members’ retirement savings by preserving and enhancing the value of those savings while ensuring that their short-term needs are met without compromising their long-term interests,” he said.“While the EPF remains cautious for the coming quarter, given the downside risks of the new highly transmissible Covid-19 variants, we assure members that we continuously take the necessary measures to protect members' savings, supported by our strong governance framework, as we strive to meet our mandate and strategic targets of providing members with a sustainable retirement.”\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: The Ministry of Finance (MoF), under the recently launched MyDigital, will ensure that payments for all government services will be made on cashless basis by 2022, its Minister, Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said.He said this will lead to higher transactional security, better coordination, enhanced communication on anti-corruption initiatives, and greater ease of sharing information.MyDigital is the nation’s digital economy blueprint -- envisioning how the country will move towards a more digitally connected economy on the Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR4.0) path.\"As at the end of last year, 60 per cent of the government's total collection was through e-payment,” he said in his speech when officiating the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) Conference 2021 today.ADVERTISINGTengku Zafrul said the government has worked continuously to ensure good governance, more efficient and effective public service delivery, as well as curbing leakages, fraud and corruption.So far, the government has pushed for digitalisation on various ends, including modernising the public service delivery and curb corruption, as this will reduce direct contact points between citizens and public officials.Tengku Zafrul said the government has shifted to electronic identification cards and biometric proof of identity for identification of citizens, expediting direct government assistance to ensure inclusiveness, accessibility, transparency and accountability.So far direct aids have been done mostly on a cashless basis, where application and payments for Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat and Geran Khas Prihatin are made electronically and online.He added that as an important influencer and advocacy towards informed decisions, accountants also play a key role in driving digitalisation and MIA has continuously putting its efforts in encouraging digital leadership and transformation through its MIA Digital Technology blueprint.\"We also appreciate MIA’s advocacy on tax governance that focuses on addressing non-compliance and systemic inefficiencies.\"By broadening the tax base -- including taxation of the shadow economy, improve tax compliance and administration matters -- this will enhance tax collection which is critical to enable the government to deliver more assistance during times of crisis, as well as for the nation’s developmental expenditures and longer-term reform agendas,” he said.He stated that the MIA has been advocating that sustainable development goal reporting should be included in corporate reporting, and this is very valuable as accountants bring unique skills and expertise within the global discourse and engagement on sustainability.Specifically, he said accountants are uniquely qualified to measure and assign climate impact costs such as carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, to provide independent assurance on sustainability processes and impacts, and to issue reports and communications on these impacts to support decision-makers and influence positive change.Themed \"Navigating a Sustainable Future with Agility and Resilience”, the three-day conference is aimed at upskilling accountants with future-relevant competencies to support and drive the global sustainability agenda, by leveraging the profession’s core competencies and ethics to advocate for business continuity and sustainability, climate solutions and digital empowerment. - Bernama\n",

It has a portfolio of 29 completed contracts total RM981.60mil.It has 22 on-going contracts worth RM1.90bil, of which RM1.2bil remains unbilled, representing 4.13 times of its four-year average revenue of RM293.97mil (FY2017 – FY2020).Nestcon expects the unbilled portion to continue contributing to its financial performance until 2023.Nestcon group managing director Datuk Dr Lim Jee Gin said while its revenue in FY2020 was marginally affected by the MCO 1.0, its profit performance remained intact with profit after tax and non-controlling interests (PATNCI) margin improving from 3.5% in FY2019 to 4.2% in FY2020.“Our cash flow from operating activities was also positive as at Dec 31,2020. We believe the results speaks volume of the capabilities of our management team in manoeuvring through tough times, ” he said.“After a year of muted growth, it is encouraging to witness the upward trajectory of the domestic economic activities and recovery momentum in the construction sector. We are seeing project tenders increasing albeit at a slower pace.“Our tender sum has grown to about RM2.80bil, with a good balance of tenders from both building and infrastructure segments,\" he said.Lim said Nestcon will use part of the proceeds to set up an industrialised building system (IBS) plant and to upgrade its software systems to reduce its dependency on human labour and improve operational efficiency.“Correspondingly, we intend to acquire more equipment and machinery to strengthen our technical capabilities to take on larger projects, as well as further expand and penetrate into other segments such as renewable energy, ” he added.Of the RM45.10mil to be raise from the IPO, Nestscon will use RM6mil (13.3%) for setting up the IBS plant, RM6.6mil (14.7%) to purchase machinery and equipment; RM1mil (2.2%) to upgrade its software and systems.Another RM16.50mil (36.6%) is to repay bank borrowings; RM11mil (24.3%) for working capital; and the remaining RM4mil (8.9%) to defray the estimated listing expenses.Upon listing on the ACE Market, Nestcon will have a market capitalisation of RM180.27mil. This will be based on the issue price of 28 sen a share and its enlarged issued shares of 643.82 million units.M&A Securities Sdn Bhd is the adviser, sponsor, underwriter, and placement agent, while Eco Asia Capital Advisory Sdn Bhd is the financial adviser.\n",

The production will do a nationwide casting in Malaysia to find someone,” said Nicol.ACE Pictures will search for Nicol’s role via a nationwide casting in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak,Nicol’s coach, Liz Irving of Australia, will be played by a Hollywood actress but no name has been given as the production is keeping most of the details under wraps for now.The screenplay will be done by two high-profile female screenwriters - a Malaysian and a US-based writer.Asked what her favourite segment in the biopic would be, Nicol said: “My best part of this movie or the essence of it is the portrayal of a woman’s will and dedication that is so profound, it becomes life itself.”“And the complex struggles one has to face when confronted with the reality of having to let go of something so deeply a part of herself,” she said.Meanwhile, ACE Pictures president Peter Wong said the biopic would be produced in English.“Hearing Nicol speak about her life story gave us a completely different view into the sacrifices that had to be done in order to achieve her remarkable level of success,” said Peter in a press statement.“While we believe many are willing to go beyond the ordinary for their careers as a pro athlete, the love and dedication Nicol has for the sport exceed normal understanding. This is why her biopic will not only be about an underdog’s rise to success - she was and always has been an established icon.”On the production’s active steps in advocating gender equality by not only choosing a pro athlete but also two distinguished women screenplay writers, Peter said: “Both are masters of the craft, we believe that collaboration between the two writers will bring about a deeper dimension and more values into the screenplay.”The biopic will not only cater to local audiences but also key markets in the US and Europe as ACE Pictures has distribution networks and connections to sales agencies in these regions.\n",

      "RARE is the tournament where the quality of the football is of the highest order, and the drama surpasses all expectations.Euro 2000, co-hosted by Belgium and Holland, was one such spectacle.So good it was, that many pundits hailed it as the best Finals ever staged.For the romantics who couldn’t help waxing lyrical about it, it was the “Renaissance of football”.France landed the top prize, but there was a feeling from the first match that the tournament was going to prove special for many reasons.As attacking philosophies largely came to the fore in a flurry of goals and entertainment, the competition boasted 2.74 goals per match – the most per game in a tournament (since 1980).Although some ugly scenes of violence managed to cast a shadow on the competition – and England’s participation – at one stage, the game emerged as the true winner.LIVING UP TO THE HYPEFrance’s squad were stronger and more experienced all-round than their World Cup-winning side in 1998.Coach Roger Lemerre inherited a side from Aime Jacquet built around Laurent Blanc, Marcel Desailly, Didier Deschamps and the excellence of a peaking Zinedine Zidane.But while Jacquet succeeded without a world class striker, Lemerre had three – Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet and Nicolas Anelka – to choose from!While the French were applauded for their attacking intent, their flair was matched by co-hosts Holland.The dazzling Dutch, under Frank Rijkaard, and their fervent supporters lit up the event, and they were the only side to beat France in their last group match.Yugoslavia also provided a feast of attacking football, but paid dearly for their defensive frailty which was ruthlessly exposed by Holland in a blistering six-goal display in the quarter-finals.There were, of course, poor teams but very few poor games.Sadly, England and Germany were two of the worst on show.The Three Lions, led by Kevin Keegan, registered a rare win over the Germans in a dour encounter and both sides deservedly failed to make it beyond the group stage.An entertaining Portugal outclassed both the traditional giants, en route to a thrilling semi-final exit at the hands of the French.ITALIAN ANTI-FOOTBALLIf there were a team that everyone loved to hate at this party of attractive football, it had to be Dino Zoff’s methodical and pragmatic Italy.The defensive kings won few fans as they halted Holland’s relentless journey to the final.With a seemingly impregnable backline featuring masters Paolo Maldini and Fabio Cannavaro, the Azzurri successfully repelled the potent attack of the Dutch – boasting Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Kluivert – with 10 men till after extra time following the dismissal of Gianluca Zambrotta after just 34 minutes in the semi-final which ended 0-0.Rijkaard’s hapless men even missed two penalties in regulation time! After the Italians prevailed 3-1 in the shootout, Zoff’s uncompromising hard men found some defenders in the form of the commentators.One highlighted it would be wrong to vilify the Italians, whose ‘defensive organisation demonstrated a different kind of admirable beauty and heroism’.PRAGMATISM vs FLAIRThe purists were on the brink of heartbreak in the final.With 90 minutes played, Italy looked set for glory thanks to Marco Delvecchio’s 55th-minute strike.But in the breathless five minutes of stoppage time that followed, the French musketeers would not be denied – substitute Sylvain Wiltord struck in the 93rd minute to send the game into extra-time.In the conclusion that was pure drama, Trezeguet rifled in a golden goal to ensure France’s place in football history.An ecstatic Deschamps said: “It’s never going to get any better than this!”He could have been talking about the whole tournament.\n",

He felt he was getting stiff so he asked to be subbed,\" Deschamps told TF1.\"The medical staff are taking care of him.\"Griezmann had another chance but Naumov was on top form and the Bulgariam was at it again to deny Giroud from close range on the stroke of halftime.Deschamps made several changes during a quieter second half, with key midfielder Ngolo Kante being replaced by Thomas Lemar in the 65th minute.Griezmann was also spared as he was replaced by Ousmane Dembele one minute later.Giroud again made the most of his chance as he cut home Benjamin Pavard's cross at the near post in the 85th and tapped in Wissam Ben Yedder's cross in added time to narrow the gap with France's all-time top scorer Thierry Henry to five goals.(Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n",

We have one positive case, there could well be more positive cases, it's probable there will be. But these players here deserve respect, as does the badge on their shirt.\"In the wake of Busquets' positive test, Spain called up six senior players - Kepa Arrizabalaga, Raul Albiol, Carlos Soler, Brais Mendez, Pablo Fornals and Rodrigo Moreno - to form a parallel training bubble so they could be called upon for the upcoming European Championship if needs be.The RFEF also said that an as yet unspecified number of under-21 players who played against Lithuania would be asked to remain in Madrid to join the parallel bubble.Spain face Sweden, who on Tuesday recorded two positive COVID-19 cases, in their Euro 2020 Group E opener next Monday.(Reporting by Joseph Walker; Editing by Toby Davis)\n",

Also obviously in the media I was seen, before Medvedev and Tsitsipas arrived, as this guy that was going to all of a sudden take over the tennis world,\" the 24-year-old told a news conference.\"I was putting pressure on myself as well. I was not very patient with myself, which I feel like now maybe I learned how to deal with the situation a little bit better, I'm maybe a little bit calmer at the tournaments.\"Zverev came back from two sets down in his first-round match, but since then the German has been steamrollering his opponents and is hungry for more.\"Obviously it's very nice to be in the semi-finals but that doesn't satisfy me. I've been playing better and better and now we'll see what happens next,\" he said.Having been knocked out in the quarter-finals twice before, by Dominic Thiem and Novak Djokovic, Zverev stood a better chance against the lower-ranked Fokina.The Spaniard signalled his intentions by breaking in the first game, moving his opponent around and mixing it with drop shots.Zverev broke straight back but looked out of sorts when the chair umpire corrected a line call, denying him another break.However, Fokina struggled with his service games as Zverev's confidence grew.Zverev hit winner after winner, while his 21-year-old opponent failed to keep the ball on court, and raced to a routine win as he claimed his 15th consecutive set in Paris.(Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne and Ken Ferris)\n",

      "PARIS (Reuters) -Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova finally reached a Grand Slam semi-final at the 52nd time of asking as she beat Kazakhstan's Elena Rybakina 6-7(2) 6-2 9-7 at the French Open on Tuesday.Six times the 29-year-old had lost at the quarter-final stage of one of the four majors, but she used all her experience to overcome her doubles partner in a gruelling scrap.Rybakina, 21, looked in control of her first Grand Slam quarter-final when she opened up a 4-1 lead in the first set but Pavlyuchenkova hit back to force a tiebreak.The Russian took the momentum into the second set to level the match and kept her nose ahead in a tense finale.Rybakina, who beat Serena Williams in the fourth round, held serve three times to stay alive in the third set.But the 21st seed failed at the fourth time of asking, ending the contest in tame fashion with a double-fault.Pavlyuchenkova will face fellow semi-final debutant Tamara Zidansek for a place in Saturday's final after the Slovenian also came though a long battle, against Spain's Paula Badosa.Despite 12 WTA titles throughout her career Pavlyuchenkova has never made a big impact at a Grand Slam.When Rybakina began as she finished against Williams on Sunday, calmly picking her spots to build a big lead, it seemed Pavlyuchenkova was heading for another quarter-final exit, having lost three at the Australian Open and one each at the other three Slams.The Russian did well to claw her way back but the tiebreak got away from her as she went 5-0 down and a backhand return into the net gave up the set to her 21-year-old opponent.Pavlyuchenkova, seeded 31, got the first break in the second set in the sixth game despite slipping over while hoisting a lob that Rybakina smashed into the net.The third set came down to a battle of wills with Pavlyuchenkova edging it to reach a maiden Grand Slam semi-final in one fewer attempt than the record 53 needed by Czech Barbora Strycova when she did it at Wimbledon in 2019.(Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Ken Ferris)\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) owner Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim has lambasted critics for claiming that he is spoiling the Malaysian football league by signing top players from other clubs.In an Instagram live session titled “Nindia Bola” hosted by football commentator Hafizal Hamad on Sunday, he answered several questions on the national team, Malaysian football and his club.However, he was piqued by a participant who asked why he is spoiling the league with multiple buying of the players.Tunku Ismail retorted by asking about the clubs who have not paid their players’ salaries for months.“If you have four to five teams not paying salaries, who is spoiling the league? Me or the clubs? If they do not take care of the welfare or salaries of the players, how can I be the person ruining the league?” he questioned.“I spend according to my means. My rivals have to spend according to their budget. In financial management, you mismanage, that’s your failure, not mine.“I rescue the players who are not getting salaries.“You can ask the PFAM president about players who haven’t received their wages and what I do for them. Every Raya, who gives Raya pocket money?“I am the owner of JDT. What’s my responsibility? The success of my club. Whatever the strategy, commercial, recruitment or academy, that’s our responsibility.“Look at Bayern (Munich), they buy players from their rivals because they want to make their team successful.“If I have to buy players to improve the team, I will buy that player. If I’ve to develop, I will develop.“My responsibility is towards JDT. If I have to buy more players, I will buy them.”Under his leadership, the Southern Tigers have won 17 trophies, of which seven of them were Super League titles. This season, they are top of the league table with 30 points.He had further enhanced his squad for the Super League when he signed Nathaniel Hong Wan from the Wolverhampton youth team in the second transfer window, and Indonesian midfielder Syahrian Abhimanyu who will return to the club after his loan stint with A-League side Newcastle Jets.He also added former Perak duo centreback Shahrul Saad and striker Guilherme De Paula in the recently concluded second transfer window.On another question that his style of managing the club borders on arrogance, Tunku Ismail said to run a professional club, you need to be the best and not be humble all the time.“If we run a professional club, you need the best transportation, clothing and players. You need to look presentable and professional. In competition, there is no humbleness.“In competition, you need an ego booster.”\n",

I want to win the European Championship with Denmark, ” Kasper Schmeichel said. “I want to try something wild with Denmark, I want to go to the World Cup and play as long as I possibly can.”With their imposing stature and commanding presence, both goalkeepers have excelled with their national team. The 34-year-old Kasper has kept 32 clean sheets in 63 matches for his country, while his father had 38 in 103 appearances.ADVERTISINGTwelve of Kasper’s 32 have come in his last 16 appearances for Denmark and his form for the national team and Leicester earned him the Danish player of the year award in January for the second straight season (and third overall).“For me, it’s not about having a good year, it’s about the continuity and stability that my position requires, ” Kasper Schmeichel said. “A goalkeeper has to be stable and have a high base level.“I feel that I have had that for many, many years now, and I also think that the teams I play for appreciate that they know where they have me and what they can expect from me.”Denmark also boast a lot of other talent, with most of the players plying their trade at Europe’s top clubs.Apart from Schmeichel, there’s Chelsea’s Andreas Christensen in defence, Inter Milan’s Christian Eriksen in midfield and Barcelona’s Martin Braithwaite up front.Eriksen will be the one expected to create scoring chances. The 29-year-old attacking midfielder has made more than 100 international appearances and became a key part of the Inter team that won their first title in 11 years.Denmark also have something of a lucky charm. Defender Jens Stryger Larsen has never been involved in a defeat in 33 appearances for his country, racking up 20 wins and 13 draws.“It’s true that I have not lost yet, and it is a completely crazy statistic to have, ” the 30-year-old Udinese defender said. “I’m happy to have it, and I would like it to continue a little longer.” — AP\n",

Going into that World Cup, we maybe weren’t sure where we were as a team, but we performed really well and stepped up to the occasion.“I feel like now we’ve had a bit more experience, players in the biggest games for their club and obviously players who have played in that World Cup have had that experience as well.“We haven’t won a tournament as a country for a long time, so there needs to be a lot of good mentality along the whole way as it is a long, tough journey to get to the later stages of a major tournament.“Obviously there’s a bit more pressure on us this year than there was going into that World Cup, so we just have to take it in our stride and look forward to the challenge.”Southgate has brought a dynamic crop of youngsters into his Euro squad, with Phil Foden, Jack Grealish, Mason Mount, Jude Bellingham and Jadon Sancho all set to experience senior international tournament action for the first time.There are just three players over the age of 30 in the England squad.Tottenham striker Kane believes Southgate has the balance just right as his country chase their first major tournament triumph since the 1966 World Cup.“I’m only 27 years old, but I’m one of the older ones in the team, ” said Kane, who finished as the top scorer at the 2018 World Cup.“We have a great balance and we know we have a long way to go with a lot of hard work between now and, hopefully, the end of the tournament, so we’ll do all we can in this preparation stage.“Everyone gets on really well and the group is great. We’ve got a great balance between young and experienced players.“We’ve got players who have been playing in the best games, the biggest games, cup finals and we have a great team.” — AFP\n",

That would be an advantage, that you do not travel. The other countries we play against play home games. That is a shame for us but we have to accept the situation as it is.\"Belgium will leave for St Petersburg on the eve of their opening game and return back to their base at Tubize, some 25km south of Brussels, straight afterwards. After three days back home, they head to Copenhagen for their second group game and from there will travel straight onto St Petersburg.Should they win their group, as they are fancied to do, Belgium then play their last 16 match in Seville but might prefer to finish runners-up, as that means a much shorter trip to Amsterdam.(Writing by Mark Gleeson in Cape Town; Editing by Christian Radnedge)\n",

      "Romelu LukakuBelgium are the world’s top-ranked team and are leading contenders to win a first major tournament, three years after finishing third at the World Cup in Russia. Their hopes will depend to a large extent on the fitness and form of Kevin De Bruyne and Eden Hazard, but they will need Lukaku to put the ball in the net.Having made his senior debut aged 16 for Anderlecht, it feels like Lukaku has been around forever. Now 28, he is in the form of his life, fresh from scoring 30 goals in all competitions for Inter Milan, including 24 in their run to the Serie A title. He is Belgium’s record goal-scorer with 60 in 93 appearances for his country, including four at the 2018 World Cup and seven in just five appearances in Euro qualifying.Cristiano RonaldoRonaldo is 36 now, so this could be his penultimate appearance at a major international tournament. His role in Portugal’s Euro 2016 triumph was actually limited -- he scored just three goals, albeit including the opener in the semi-final against Wales, and he came off injured in the first half of the final against France.Ronaldo’s importance to Portugal may not be what it once was either given the wealth of talent spread throughout their team. However, he is still coming off a season in which he scored 36 goals for Juventus, and the Portugal skipper is now eyeing the all-time international scoring record of 109 held by Iran’s Ali Daei -- Ronaldo is currently just six shy of that figure.Harry KaneKane’s build-up to the Euro has been overshadowed by the uncertainty surrounding his future at club level after he indicated last month that it might be time for him to leave Tottenham Hotspur. However, the 27-year-old England captain will need to put that to the back of his mind to focus on Euro 2020 as he prepares to lead Gareth Southgate’s attack.The top scorer at the 2018 World Cup with six goals, Kane went on to score 12 times in Euro qualifying and was the top scorer in the Premier League in the season just finished with 23 goals, despite playing in an underperforming Spurs team.Given the quality of players around him creating the chances, it could be another prolific summer for Kane.Robert LewandowskiAt 32, Lewandowski is at the peak of his powers, fresh from breaking Gerd Mueller’s long-standing record for the most goals in a Bundesliga season as he netted 41 times in 29 appearances for Bayern Munich.Had the Ballon d’Or been awarded last year, Lewandowski would have been a worthy winner. His chances of winning it this year probably depend on how he performs at the Euro for Poland, and Lewandowski has not done well at recent major tournaments -- he netted just once at Euro 2016 and not at all as his country limped out of the last World Cup in the group stage.Gerard MorenoSpain do not boast the star-studded squad of years past but there is no shortage of talent at Luis Enrique’s disposal and the man to look out for in attack is Moreno, the 29-year-old fresh from scoring 23 goals in La Liga, a tally bettered only by Lionel Messi.The former Espanyol marksman also netted seven times in the Europa League and scored in the penalty shoot-out in the final as Villarreal beat Manchester United. A late bloomer, Moreno only made his debut for Spain in the qualifying campaign for the Euro under former coach Robert Moreno.Karim BenzemaThe return of Benzema to the France squad was sensational news, the Real Madrid striker ending five and a half years in the international wilderness. He had not played for his country since a blackmail scandal over a sextape involving his former teammate Mathieu Valbuena broke in 2015.His hopes of a recall seemed to recede in January, when French prosecutors said they had decided to send Benzema and four others for trial. However, coach Didier Deschamps could no longer ignore Benzema’s form after a season in which he scored 30 goals for his club. His addition further strengthens an already fearsome France side. — AFP\n",

      "LOCAL authorities in Klang Valley have been urged to review their decision to close public parks during the lockdown period.Social activist Tan Sri Lee Lam Thye said it was important to allow people, especially those living in low-cost flats, to have a suitable space for physical exercises.Lee, who is committee chairman of Taman Pudu Ulu, a public park under Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL), said prolonged isolation at home with family members was bound to create tension, which could lead to deterioration of mental health.“People need some space to release pent-up energy.“They will be bored if they are cooped up at home for too long.“What if the lockdown is extended? The relevant authorities must come up with a solution to this matter, ” he said.DBKL announced on May 31 that it would close all public parks under its jurisdiction from June 1 to 14 in light of the lockdown announced by the government.On the same day, National Landscape Department announced on its official Facebook page that it would close Taman Persekutuan Bukit Kiara in Taman Tun Dr Ismail without giving an exact reopening date.Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) followed suit the next day, announcing that all its public playgrounds, parks and hiking trails would be off-limits to the public.Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob had announced that sports and recreational activities would be limited to jogging and non-contact exercises during the lockdown.These activities can take place in a neighbourhood from 7am to 8pm, subject to the usual standard operating procedure.Lee said although people were allowed to exercise in their neighbourhood, this presented some health and safety concerns.“Safety risk increases because of traffic on roads and they are also exposed to exhaust fumes, which is unhealthy, ” he said.He noted that local authorities could consider opening parks if they ensured proper precautions were taken.“The types of activities that are permitted should be limited to jogging and brisk walking with no group activities.“Enforcement officers should be stationed to monitor compliance and ensure physical distancing, ” said Lee, adding that they should issue fines if SOP was not followed.\n",

      "SINCE the Covid-19 pandemic started, Malaysians have come forward and shown their generous side.Individuals and business entities are getting together to offer help to the less fortunate and those who have lost their jobs or whose income is badly hit when business dropped.Many cannot afford to put food on the table due to these unforeseen events.Kind-hearted individuals and organisations have come to their aid by offering them rice, flour, eggs and sugar among other essential foodstuff, through food banks set up in various places in Klang Valley.StarMetro spoke to three individuals on how their establishments have provided food for those in need.Contactless food bankkEATchen, a food and beverage business based in Ara Damansara, Petaling Jaya is a cloud kitchen that started just a few weeks ago.(Cloud kitchen is a business that prepares food for sale specifically for delivery).Most people new to the business would not think of starting an initiative that provided food for the needy, but this was not the case with kEATchen.Its chief operating officer Ivan Chan said the business became a charity overnight, although it was still very much an F&B business.“The food bank idea came to me on May 30 after a childhood friend asked for some money to buy milk powder for his baby.“He has been out of a job since the first movement control order and has not been able to find a job for over a year, ” he said.Chan said that it was then that he realised how badly some people were affected by the pandemic, even if they were not in the B40 category, and he decided to use part of his business premises as a temporary food bank.“I shared a post on social media to let people know what I wanted to do and before I knew it, people started sharing it in their chat groups.“Since then, we have been giving out more than two tonnes of foodstuff every day with each bag comprising at least 1.5kg of rice, 1.5kg potatoes, 1kg cooking oil, 1kg sugar and 15 eggs, which should last three to four days for a family of four.”Helping him distribute the items are volunteers, including employees and family members of kEATchen’s management.According to Chan, many of the recipients are the hardcore poor living in people’s housing projects and low-cost flats who have to travel almost 10km to reach the temporary food bank.“Seeing some people coming by in cars shows that even the middle-income group is financially stressed now, ” he said.He added that kEATchen also distributed food items to the Taxi Drivers Welfare Association and people living in Kepong and Puchong.“At times we have kind donors who send in extra items like biscuits, noodles and flour. We add them into each bag, ” said Chan.Another item sometimes included, he said, was baby formula.He said it came to a point where there were long queues and overcrowding, so a new plan had to be implemented to distribute the items.They follow the standard operating procedure strictly and regularly disinfect the collection area.His team also monitors those who collect the foodstuff, via photographs and their MySejahtera check-in history which they impose as a pre-condition.Chan said the food supplies were placed in pigeonholes made specially for food collection without having contact with anyone.To help disperse the crowd, he reached out to Petaling Jaya MP Maria Chin Abdullah to set up additional collection points.“We hand over 220 bags or about 1.5 tonnes of foodstuff each day to her office for distribution in Lembah Subang and Desa Mentari.“We ourselves take care of those from other areas, which come to about 500 complete sets a day.”So far, Chan has spent RM10, 000 of his own money.His family and friends have helped out and he plans to continue the effort as long as the MCO is in force.Community food boxShell Setia Alam retailer Suraya Saruwan started offering provisions in a food box at her petrol station a year ago.It was the first of its kind at any petrol station.The concept became a model for over 50 other stations and an inspiration for other businesses that replicated it to help those who were affected financially.In the early stages, after non-governmental organisation Volunteer’s Unite approached her station to start a food bank, Suraya engaged with residents in the community to help sustain the initiative.“Nowadays, I rarely need to replenish the items from my own supply.“In fact, when we have a surplus of food, we send them to the elderly and the disabled as well as to welfare homes nearby, ” she said.She highlighted that they also delivered to those who did not have transport to get to the petrol station.This, she said, was made possible by engaging with the management of apartments who identify suitable recipients.Suraya said other petrol stations were doing the same but focused on welfare homes.“At this station, we limit each person taking the food to three items but we give the elderly more basic necessities so they won’t need to come out so much during the pandemic.”She said many at the Akasia and Semarak apartments lived alone or without their children.Now, the food box collection at Shell petrol stations also accept and distribute non-perishable goods as well as personal care items such as soap, diapers and toiletries.“We also receive non-food items from donors, including baby diapers.“Someone even left a baby car seat by our food box that was in good condition. It quickly found a new owner who had recently given birth.”According to Suraya, more people are showing up to pick up things from the food box since the latest MCO which started on June 1.“It is not surprising because many people have had to take a pay cut, ” she noted.Volunteers Unite founder Alfred Samuel Mariyaras said the food boxes around Shah Alam, Klang, Subang Jaya and Petaling Jaya were actively being utilised and were normally able to meet the needs of the beneficiaries.Alfred, who helps top up community food boxes with products sourced from corporations or other non-governmental organisations such as Kembara Kitchen, said it was heartening to see support from them.“It is also good to see the number of food boxes growing, not just among the Shell petrol stations, ” he added.Aside from providing humanitarian aid to disaster-stricken areas when necessary, Volunteers Unite is currently focusing on providing food aid to the needy throughout the pandemic, including welfare homes.Food projectOn a normal day before the pandemic, The Lost Food Project (TLFP) enlisted the help of over 100 volunteers to save food from ending up in landfills.It diverted food to the hungry in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor and Johor.In May alone, TLFP distributed about 60 tonnes of food, shared between 67 charity organisations.Since June 1, only about 20 volunteers have been on the ground to sort through tonnes of food and ensure they are fit for human consumption before packing them for distribution.“Much of the food is actually still of high quality, but the vendors are not able to sell them on the particular day, ” said TLFP general manager Mohd Syazwan Mokhtar.Items of lower quality and unsuitable for people will be sent to its composting partner or the National Zoo to feed the animals.Mohd Syazwan said that despite the amount of food collected by TLFP, food was scarce for the long list of charities waiting to be included as beneficiaries.“Our operations are mainly supported through donations from the public and corporate sector, and we try to deliver food to the charities daily.“We see ourselves as supporters of an ecosystem that is already quite strong, by supplying charities and NGOs with food or preparing ready cooked meals, ” he said.He added that TLFP also distributed food to B40 households in Lembah Pantai, Batu and Setiawangsa, in Kuala Lumpur, as well as in Klang and Petaling Jaya in Selangor.”Mohd Syazwan said TLFP was a charity organisation and a logistics NGO, which was like a hub or middleman between the industry players and the beneficiaries, while dealing with surplus goods directly from retailers, suppliers or even manufacturers.“We also work with wholesale markets such as Pasar Borong Kuala Lumpur, which is our biggest contributor for fresh vegetables every month.“I don’t think there is ever going to be enough supply as demand is always high. Many people are struggling, even before the MCO, ” he said.“In February and March, we received between 80 and 100 tonnes of supplies a month from the wholesale market, but it dropped to 50 tonnes in April and 40 tonnes in May, also due to factors of supply from farms.”Mohd Syazwan said TLFP had received distress calls for aid in recent weeks and was helping to distribute non-food products as well.“We have seen our beneficiary base increase exponentially since last year and there are definitely more people out there in need.”He added that TLFP was fortunate to be able to make up for it when manufacturers provide more non-fresh food alternatives during the period.“One of the blessings to come out of this pandemic is seeing people willing to help in a crisis, ” he said.\n",

      "IPOH: A factory worker here became worried when he was told to return to work a day after taking a Covid-19 swab test.The 23-year-old, who asked to be identified only as CK, said a colleague had tested positive a few weeks earlier and he was upset that the factory management did not appear to consider the workers' wellbeing.“We told our supervisor that we should be undergoing self-quarantine after the swab test.\"However, we were told to start work the following day,\" he said when contacted on Tuesday (June 8).\"It was fortunate that the results came back negative but I still feel it's not right to (make us) return to work without being quarantined at home,\" he added.CK, who lives with his elderly parents, said he would ask them to remain in their room whenever he returned from work.\"Although both of them have been vaccinated, I don’t want to risk it, ” he said.CK said the factory was closed a few days ago for sanitisation after two people in another department contracted Covid-19.\"I hope the authorities will conduct more inspections at factories that are still operating during the current movement control order,\" he said.Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah had remarked that a third of the 30 new Covid-19 clusters announced on Sunday (June 6) were from factories.In Perak, there are at least three clusters related to factories, namely the Bukit Panchor Industrial cluster, Taman Industri Pelabuhan cluster and the Jalan Tembaga Kuning cluster.Perak Consumer Association president Abdul Rahman Said Alli said the government needs to play its role and protect the people’s health.“There are many clusters reportedly from factories and workplaces, yet some are still allowed to open. Will factories run out of business if they are closed for a few weeks?“We have played our part by sending e-mail to the related ministry but we have not received any replies,\" he said.“If we follow the rules from the first MCO, we will be able to break the chain. We came so close to it and even had days where there were no cases reported. So why are we not doing that again?” he added.Administrator Nur Aminah Othman, from Manjoi, said closing down factories for a few weeks would help break the chain of Covid-19 transmission.“I am not sure how there was such a spike in positive cases in our area but I was told that there are several cases believed to be from a nearby mosque and factories just a stone's throw from my house, ” said the 32-year-old.“I know it is hard to please everybody, but our health is more important,\" she said, adding that her area was now being under the enhanced MCO.Ipoh City Watch president Prof Dr Richard Ng said instead of closing down factories, the government should implement stricter standard operating procedures (SOP).“The industrial sector, especially the small to medium enterprises, have been facing great losses since MCO 1.0 as factories were told to close.\"As a result, many employees were retrenched, resulting in a high unemployment rate,\" he said.“The economic recovery stimulus package provided is not sufficient to sustain their operations, so it is not advisable to close these factories.\"The better option is to implement strict compliance to SOP, ” he said.He said factories that are fully automated should be allowed to operate.“Only factories that are not strictly complying with the SOP should be ordered to close.\"These factories must also sign a letter of undertaking to strictly comply with SOP,\" said Ng.“There are already heavy fines imposed by the government on companies or individuals that do not comply with the SOP.\"What we need is strict enforcement. I am sure these factories would rather cooperate than be told to close,\" he added.\n",

      "A TRADER at the Bukit Mertajam market, which is closed after Covid-19 cases were reported there, was slapped with compounds after he removed part of the fencing there to unload goods for his business.The market is to remain closed until tomorrow.The trader flouted the standard operating procedure (SOP) by entering the market premises on June 1 and taking down part of the fencing put up by the Seberang Prai City Council (MBSP) without the council’s permission.MBSP in a statement said they issued a compound for vandalism under the council’s Vandalism By-Law 1993, which carries a fine of not more than RM2,000 or jail term no longer than a year, or both, if found guilty and a compound under the MPSP Licence Fees By-Law 1980.“As this premises has been closed by the Ministry of Health, the trader will also be subjected to enforcement actions by the ministry, involving a compound of up to RM5,000 under Section 18(1)(d) of the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Act for the offence of carrying out activities (unloading business goods) in the area or premises that has been closed.“Traders and the public are reminded to always abide by the instructions issued by the authorities in order to stop the spread of Covid-19, ” the statement read.Earlier on May 31, MBSP mayor Datuk Rozali Mohamud said sanitisation work and contact tracing at the market would be carried out while the market was closed.Rozali warned traders to comply with all SOPs and those who have been asked to take a swab test, to comply.\n",

      "TWO octogenarians were among the first 200 senior citizens to receive their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at a private hospital in Johor Baru.Abdullah Dawam, 87, said he was happy that the government was accelerating the vaccination programme for senior citizens by roping in private hospitals to serve as vaccine dispensing centres (PPV) in the state.The retired army officer had assumed that he would have to wait long as he only registered for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme in April.“I have no health issues, only my hearing is not good,’’ he said, when met at KPJ Johor Specialist Hospital at Jalan Abdul Samad.Abdullah, who lives in Kampung Melayu Pandan, will have to return in 14 days to get his second dose of vaccine at the hospital.Another senior citizen, retired hospital attendant Salleh Appandy, said he felt lucky as his children had registered him via the MySejahtera app for the vaccination programme only on May 25.Like Abdullah, the 88-year-old Salleh from Kampung Bakar Batu, Permas Jaya also has no major health issues, except for hearing problems.“Avoid taking sugary and carbonated drinks as too much sugar is not good for your health,’’ advised Salleh, who had served for 30 years at the Sultanah Aminah Hospital Johor Baru.KPJ Johor Specialist Hospital is among the seven private hospitals in Johor which have been listed to administer vaccines under the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme starting June 1.The seven hospitals comprise four in Johor Baru and one each in Kluang, Batu Pahat and Muar.KPJ Johor Specialist Hospital chief executive officer Mohd Azhar Abdullah said it had been tasked with vaccinating 1,000 recipients, the majority being senior citizens, from May 31 until June 4.“We are willing to continue with the programme if the Health Ministry requests for it to speed up Covid-19 immunisation for Malaysians,’’ he said.\n",

      "HUNDREDS of taxi drivers are giving up their jobs to look for other sources of income as their daily earnings have dropped by at least 80% because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Taxi driver Mohd Zamri Mahazan, 48, said many among the more than 2, 000 taxi drivers operating at the Larkin Bus Terminal area had hung up their keys as they depended heavily on tourism activities for income.He said travel restrictions and border closures had resulted in a huge drop in the number of passengers.“We cannot rely on local customers as they usually have their own transportation or prefer e-hailing service, which was already a competitor before the pandemic.“Before Covid-19, we could earn about RM100 to RM150 a day.“Our daily income has now dropped so much that sometimes it is difficult to even get RM15 a day.“We hope the government will look into our welfare when formulating a new financial aid package because things will get worse under this third movement control order, ” he said.Mohd Zamri was among 20 taxi drivers, who received essential items and cash from Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia Armada national exco member Saiful Bahari.Another taxi driver, Rahizam Ahmad, 53, said some of his peers had switched to selling burgers and banana fritters to sustain their families as they could no longer afford to wait hours in their vehicle, not knowing if and when they would get a passenger.“I often have to wait for more than three hours before getting a customer, just to earn a few ringgit.“We charge by the meter and the fare is not enough to cover my petrol, taxi rental and other expenses.“Sometimes, I have no choice but to skip a few meals to save money as I still have to pay my bills, loans and family expenses.“It is not easy to make the switch either, because not many have the capital to start a business.“And we would also have to compete with existing and more established businesses, ” he said.Setia Tropika Home Ministry Complex Zone Taxi Drivers Welfare Association deputy chairman Ahmad@Rahmat Rahman hopes the Federal Government would consider reviewing or upgrading the taxi operating system.“As taxi drivers, we are trapped in the conventional way of operating, which makes it difficult for us to compete against e-hailing services, especially during times like these, ” he added.Meanwhile, Saiful, who handed the aid to taxi drivers at the Larkin Bus Terminal, said his team had distributed more than 15 tonnes of rice to the needy since January and would continue to do so to help more people.“Besides taxi drivers, we also distributed essential supplies to underprivileged groups and low-income families to help them through the pandemic, ” he said, adding that those in need can get in touch with him via his Facebook page.\n",

      "WITH the recent spike in Covid-19 cases locally, Johor MCA’s civil society coordination bureau has kicked off its “drop off and go” initiative to distribute aid.The aid is given to low-income families and those who have lost their jobs during the pandemic.Bureau head Chua Jian Boon said the initiative distributed essential items and vegetables to those in need by just dropping them off at the recipients’ front door to avoid physical contact.“We want to help the needy as many have lost their source of income as a result of the pandemic and are still finding it difficult to get a job.“The donated items include dry food, vegetables and eggs, and these will differ from time to time.“To kick off the project, we gave aid to 23 recipients in the Kelapa Sawit area in Kulai and this is where we will be focusing our efforts for now, ” he said when interviewed.Families and individuals in the B40 income group, who need aid, can contact him via his Facebook page.“For those staying in areas outside Kulai, I will refer their cases to local community leaders, ” said Chua, who is also national MCA public complaints and services bureau deputy chief.He said B40 recipients who had previously received government’s financial assistance had complained that they were no longer eligible for the aid the following year despite still being in the low-income group.He noted that at this point, other than rolling out the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme more effectively, the government must come up with a more comprehensive post-pandemic economic recovery plan.Meanwhile, Johor MCA Youth presented about RM15, 000 worth of provisions to Universiti Teknologi Malaysia after its Skudai campus was placed under enhanced movement control order from May 21 to June 3 in view of the high number of infections there.State MCA Youth chief Ling Tian Soon said the university’s students representative council sought help from MCA.“The items were handed over to the university management to distribute to students’ dormitories and ensure they had enough essential goods to tide them over during that period, ” he said. — By YEE XIANG YUN\n",

      "RESIDENTS living in a flood-prone part of Taman Seah Hong in Klang can rest easy as several mitigation measures have been planned for the neighbourhood.The measures, which include widening a 390m drain stretch along Jalan Pekan Baru 26 and building a detention pond on a small plot of land sandwiched between Jalan Pekan Baru 26 and 27, will be carried out following a proposal by Klang Municipal Council’s (MPK) Engineering Department.MPK councillor Low Kwee Sia said the department proposed building a detention pond, which would hold rainwater runoff to be released at a predetermined rate, and widening the drain to curb flash floods that had been plaguing families living here.Taman Seah Hong has about 150 terrace houses.The flood mitigation project is slated to start in October and be completed by February next year.The floods have caused a lot of anxiety, especially for senior citizens who have been living in the area since the late 1970s.Resident Chung King Chai, 75, said heavy rain would cause water in the drains to overflow and reach knee height, making the roads in the neighbourhood impassable.“The water inundates the terrace houses in the area, causing damage to our belongings.“It is tough as we are saddled with the clean-up each time floods occur, ” he told StarMetro.Soh Chwee Yan, 73, said floods had been a growing problem since mid-2010.“Surrounding areas have been concreted and cannot soak up rainwater, so during downpours, rainwater has nowhere to go except into drains consequently overwhelming them and causing flash floods, ” she said.Another resident, TA Yang, 71, said people in the neighbourhood were fearful whenever there was a thunderstorm and worried that water would come rushing into their homes, destroying furniture and electrical items.According to residents, it usually takes up to two hours for floodwaters to subside.Yang and other residents urged MPK to speed up the flood mitigation project.Low, who visited the area, said he would keep the residents updated on the project.“MPK’s Engineering Department has assured the people in Taman Seah Hong that the flash floods issue will be resolved with the proposed project.“I have accepted the department’s professional advice and I will keep tabs on the project once it starts, ” he said.On an unrelated matter, Low asked MPK to address complaints of stagnant water near tents that house the temporary wholesale section of Pasar Besar Meru.“Water from the section stagnates outside the tents and it smells bad.“We want the matter resolved quickly as it involves hygiene, ” he said during a site visit.Klang Market Traders Association president Ng Soo Keong told StarMetro that he had asked for three spotlights to be installed in front of Blocks A and B as it was pitch-dark in the wee hours of the morning.“In February, I requested MPK to put up spotlights for the safety of customers, traders and workers.“But until now, no action has been taken, ” he said.Ng added that MPK should also improve the water pressure in the toilets at the market as hygiene would be compromised otherwise.\n",

      "I WANT to go home!Under the movement control order (MCO), I am stuck in Penang while my family is back in my hometown, Ipoh.Pictures of their delicious home- cooked meals and interesting lockdown activities in our family chatgroup never fail to make me yearn for home.Thankfully, my brother managed to head home before the lockdown and be with our parents after completing his finals exam, or else he would have been stuck in Melaka.Seeing their yummy dishes has motivated me to try cooking on my own, so I asked for the recipes from my mum and brother.Let’s hope I’ll not burn down the kitchen!But the lazy person in me still depends on takeaways and deliveries.Being in a lockdown can really take a toll on people’s mental health due to the lack of human interaction and uncertain, worrying situations.Instead of focusing on the negative, I recently decided to make some ‘lockdown resolutions’ and mark things off the bucket list.Here are some of the things that I would like to achieve during the lockdown.For someone who prefers outdoor exercises such as hiking and cycling, not being able to be with nature is eating me up.I was hiking at least once a week prior to the lockdown and it was a great exercise to shed the extra pounds.For now, I can only jog around my neighbourhood or do home exercises by following fitness gurus on YouTube.Then there is my diet, which is always in a mess. But then, there is always a tomorrow when it comes to eating clean and losing weight.Inspired by one of my assistant news editors, I gave a short-term egg fast a try but failed terribly.It is funny how everything seems to be tastier when you are starting a diet. The junk food on my shelf seduces me when I walk past them every time.But still, I have decided that I should take small steps when making healthier food choices.Another inspiration from someone close to my heart has gotten me to practise meatless Fridays.Studies have shown that going meatless at least once a week is good for our health and that it lowers the risk of getting cancer.It is June now, half a year has passed; time to look back at the resolutions that I made at the beginning of the year.Small steps can really make a big difference in the long run andI believe that habits shape life. Remember the hare and tortoise story? Slow and steady wins the race.So, without pushing myself too hard, I will make conscious day-by-day efforts to cook my own food more often and eat clean.Next will be the effort to form deeper bonds and relationships.It is important to look out for each other and support friends and family. A kind gesture, a phone call or even a smile can always go a long way.I have been watching quite a few lifestyle videos on YouTube.Instead of scrolling through people’s social media and comparing myself with them, I am trying to focus more on improving myself and be thankful for the good things and kind souls in my life.As we have more time during the lockdown period, why not pick up some books to read?Reading can expand our horizon and make us wiser. It will stimulate our creativity and is a sweet escape from the drudgery of life.A few days ago, I visited a bakery in George Town and was amazed at how an undergraduate took up entrepreneurship during the first MCO.Her passion for baking was ignited and she started selling burnt cheesecakes through her social media.I was impressed by how she managed to find the light at the end of the tunnel and turn it into an opportunity to start a business during the pandemic.My social media feed has been flooded with pictures of delicious home-cooked food and desserts during the MCO and surprisingly, many of my friends are good chefs and bakers.People are staying safe at home and not travelling unnecessarily, and it turns out that cooking and baking are their escapism.I was told that cream cheese and sponge fingers were sold out during the first MCO due to the burnt cheesecake and tiramisu craze.I wonder what the trend will be this year? Come on people, show the world your creativity! I can’t wait to see what this lockdown will offer.\n",

      "KEPONG Baru market traders want Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) to reconsider the decision to close outdoor markets during the lockdown, especially since some hawkers are allowed to operate by the roadside during this period.The traders also fear the possibility of the lockdown being extended beyond June 14, which will impact their income further.Traders said it was unfair for DBKL to allow hawkers under the Federal Territories Ministry’s Bebas Berniaga initiative to operate but this leeway was not given to outdoor markets traders.“Outdoor market traders in Kuala Lumpur are not allowed to operate but those in Selangor can open shop,” said Kepong Baru Zone C Market Traders Associations chairman Loo Fook Lan.“To us, this is double-standards.“We can only obey the rules set by the local authority and stop operating for two weeks but what happens if the lockdown is extended?“Most of the traders here earn a meagre income and can only sustain themselves for a short period of time.”She said outdoor market traders were willing to comply with additional safety measures if required as long as DBKL reconsiders allowing them to trade.“We are open to negotiation on stricter SOP as long as DBKL permits outdoor markets to open.“The Kepong Baru market has undergone a facelift and is not as cramped as before.“Traders are practising physical distancing and the People’s Volunteer Corps (Rela) officers are there to ensure SOP compliance,” she said during a press conference at the Kepong Baru wet market.According to the National Security Council’s SOP guidelines dated June 2, daily and public markets are allowed to operate from 6am to 2pm subject to the local authority approval.However, in Kuala Lumpur indoor markets can operate but outdoor markets are to remain closed due to DBKL’s ruling.Kepong Hawkers and Petty Traders Association vice-chairman Deric Teh said the movement control order extension would spell disaster for market traders.“Market traders cannot sustain further and the association will appeal to DBKL for outdoor markets to reopen if the lockdown is extended.“We also hope the government can give out incentives to traders including night market traders who are also affected by the lockdown,” he said.Kepong Community Service Centre head Yee Poh Ping said the lockdown has affected 700 hawkers and traders.“I have appealed to Kuala Lumpur mayor Datuk Mahadi Che Ngah and Federal Territories Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa to reopen these markets.“The current ruling allowing roadside hawkers to do business but not affording market traders the same treatment is unfair.“Besides, market traders observed the safety SOP during the previous MCO and they can still do the same,” he said.Police and DBKL representatives were also present to check on the traders at the time of the press conference.\n",

      "IF all goes well, Penang could achieve Covid-19 herd immunity earlier than expected, with 70% or 1.38 million people, getting vaccinated by August.State health committee chairman Dr Norlela Ariffin said the present vaccination of 14,814 daily doses this month would be ramped up to 35,165 doses next month and 35,572 doses in August.She said 103,627 targeted recipients had obtained the first dose while 73,607 more recipients had obtained both doses in the state as of June 3.Dr Norlela said a comprehensive plan would be presented at the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) meeting today.“All our systems are in place to attain this. At the meeting, we will present our preparation to achieve our target.“These proposals were discussed at an earlier CITF meeting.“A lot of background work has been done and we already have a plan for the implementation,” she said.Dr Norlela said the decentralisation of vaccine administration would be key to achieving the goal.She said two more vaccine-dispensing centres (PPV) would be set up at Penang Pesta site today and Seberang Jaya expo site on June 14, while three more at Dewan Balai Rakyat Bayan Baru, Pusat Konvensyen Perda and Dewan Serbaguna Sungai Bakap were in the pipeline.She added that for now, Penang has one mega PPV at Setia SPICE Arena and five PPVs located at Caring Society Complex, Balik Pulau Sports Complex, Dewan Millenium, Dewan Serbaguna Jawi and Seberang Prai Arena Convention Centre.Norlela said PPVs had also been set up in three private hospitals yesterday.They are Lam Wah Ee Hospital, Pantai Hospital and KPJ Hospital, while another three in LohGuanLye Specialists Centre, Penang Adventist Hospital and Gleneagles Hospital are expected to begin operation on June 14.“Increasing the number of PPVs will accelerate the vaccination process.“Vaccine supply should not be an issue as the state will get two million vaccines in June and July.“The Health Ministry is supportive of our pro-active approach in the vaccination process.“They have promised to deploy trainee nurses and doctors, final-year medical students, retired nurses and hospital staff.“Administrating the vaccination dosage is not a very difficult task and most of them could be of great help in the process.“Some 500 general practitioners will be on board in the planned PPVs,” she said.Norlela said she would also propose for drive-through PPVs to be set up at Mydin Perda in Bukit Mertajam and the State Stadium in Batu Kawan.“The stadium can be used as an industrial PPV with company employees working in the zone going there for vaccination. They do not have to crowd at the existing PPVs.“The proposal also includes using parking lots of Ikea Batu Kawan, Lotus’s (formerly Tesco Extra) Seberang Jaya and several big malls as PPVs.“We have also proposed for the closed Equatorial Hotel Penang to be turned into a vaccination centre which can be used by company workers in the industrial zone.“Both the Malaysia Semiconductor Industry Association and Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) are on board for the plan.“FMM has 320 small-and-medium-scale industry members who employ fewer than 1,500 people.“And with more PPVs, more of these people can be vaccinated,” she said.For large manufacturers, Norlela said on-site vaccinations would be implemented, with preparation being handled by the companies themselves.She said Penang is a small state, and should be able to achieve the targeted vaccination figures as planned.Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow had earlier said that the state was looking at achieving herd immunity by October.He said the three challenges were the number of PPVs, vaccine supply and manpower.\n",

      "At a time when double masking is encouraged for maximum protection against Covid-19, it has come to light that some sanitation workers are not wearing necessary protective gear as they go about their work.Welfare and animal rights group Persatuan Penyayang and Kesaksamaan Kuala Lumpur (PPKKL) president Idris Moktar shared his observations of sanitation workers accompanying rubbish trucks on their rounds in Kampung Baru and the Chow Kit area.“Watching workers handle bags of rubbish with their bare hands leaves me to wonder if they have been properly briefed on the possible dangers of infectious materials like used sanitary pads, diapers or face masks, which are regularly found in domestic waste.“As some of the workers are foreigners, it is possible that they may not understand what is being said at daily briefings though they are seen wearing masks and gloves when they clock in for inspection.“Ideally, there should be instructional pamphlets printed out in the workers’ native tongue so that the message on donning personal protective equipment (PPE) can be effectively conveyed,” he told StarMetro.Former SS20 Rukun Tetangga (RT) chairman Eileen Thong, who echoed Idris’ sentiments, said masks, gloves, safety footwear and sanitisers should be part of these workers’ standard operating procedure while on their collection rounds.“Seeing the workers touching rubbish without gloves and wearing their masks below their noses or on chins is worrying as our waste now consists of thousands of used face masks,” she added.PPE is essentialEnvironment and waste management specialist Dr Theng Lee Chong agrees that donning PPE is compulsory for workers in this sector by international standards.In fact, it is essential for their safety.“In a housing estate, for example, there is no way of knowing who are the users of the discarded items.“So for their own safety, workers should not even open the rubbish bags to rummage for recyclables as they may come in contact with needles, bandages or even drinking bottles used by individuals who have infectious diseases.“At the very least, they should have aprons, gloves and rubber boots to safeguard against exposure to possibly harmful bacteria, which may be present in the rubbish as well as leachate coming from it,” he stressed.In a study led by Professor Kamruddin Ahmed, director of Borneo Medical and Health Research Centre at Universiti Malaysia Sabah, it was revealed that urban sanitation workers were among the occupations that have a high risk of contracting leptospirosis as it required contact with waste.During his research, blood samples from 303 sanitation workers in Kota Kinabalu were tested in 2017 and 133 tested positive for leptospira, a bacterium that causes leptospirosis.In an urban setting, leptospirosis can spread to humans through rat urine in rubbish areas.At its most severe, the disease can cause kidney failure and brain damage.With this in mind, retired broker and Taman Desa resident Kenny Tan said waste companies must take a top-down approach in this matter.“Management must prioritise its ground crew’s welfare and health, and not treat it as a micro issue to be left to their supervisors to handle.“It all boils down to having checks and balances.“Having such standards in place will also reflect well on the company,” he opined.Policies in placeKDEB Waste Management (KDEBWM) general manager of operation Mohd Idris Mohamed Yusof said the SOP for sanitation workers collecting domestic solid waste was to don safety shoes and reflective vests as stipulated in the agreement with their contractors.KDEBWM, a wholly owned subsidiary of Mentri Besar Selangor Incorporated, was established to manage domestic waste collection and public cleansing services in Selangor.“The compulsory inclusion of face masks was introduced at the start of the first movement control order in March last year,” said Mohd Idris.To minimise the risk of exposure to infectious diseases among ground crew, they were to make full use of the bin lifter on refuse compactor trucks instead of holding rubbish with their hands, he added.Constant reminders to wear PPE are also given on a daily basis during morning briefings before work starts.Mohd Idris said at these briefings, workers were told that they risked being exposed to Covid-19 or other infectious diseases if the SOP was not followed.Ground crew were also required to observe physical distancing of at least one metre when dealing with the public.“A gentle reminder will be given to contractors whose workers are seen not complying with the agreed SOP.“If they continue to flout the SOP, they will be fined up to a maximum of RM500 for each offence,” he added.On medical insurance for workers in case of hospitalisation, Mohd Idris noted that there was an existing workmen’s compensation insurance providing cover for its local crew.Foreign workers come under the Foreign Workers Medical Examination Monitoring Agency (Fomema) insurance scheme, which is with their annual work permit renewals.KDEBWM also has a corporate social responsibility programme, where donations are given to crew members if accidental injuries occur in the course of their duties.Since the start of the MCO last year, the company has donated 17,000 face masks and 1,000 bottles of hand sanitiser to their subcontractors.Taking a proactive roleAccording to KDEBWM Kajang operation head Abdul Razak Abu Talib, the public has a proactive role to play when it comes to the safety of rubbish collectors.“In addition to encountering setbacks like theft and acts of vandalism of metal leach bins placed at communal rubbish collection areas, the ground crew often has two major challenges.“This includes improperly tied up rubbish bags, which result in waste spillage, and piled up rubbish, making it too heavy to be hitched onto the bin lifter.“So, the ground crew has little choice but to haul some of the rubbish bags into the compactor truck to lighten the load of the leach bin,” he explained.“They also have to pick up the scattered rubbish and this needs to be done in the shortest time possible, as trucks have to stop on narrow public roads during collection service. If the process takes too long, it causes a traffic jam.“Rushed for time, workers often resort to doing the job by hand as it is a faster solution,” he said.Another problem faced at these communal rubbish collection areas is traders also dump their rubbish there, resulting in excessive waste.Abdul Razak said commercial entities have to deal with their own waste and not throw them in these areas, which are only meant for residents.To top it off, bulk waste such as mattresses and used furniture are also disposed of at these areas, where rubbish is collected thrice weekly.“It will be helpful to the ground crew if the public can take a mindful approach to rubbish disposal.“At the very least, they should secure their waste disposal bags to prevent spillage,” he said.To ensure the safety of its ground crew, KDEBWM would be conducting regular checks on PPE usage, its media and public relations head Mahfuzah Muhammad Tarmidi told StarMetro.Likewise, Alam Flora chief executive officer Datuk Mohd Zain Hassan has also addressed this issue on its website, assuring that field staff are constantly reminded to wash their hands and use sanitisers.The wearing of PPE is also compulsory for them.Mohd Zain said steps had been taken to prevent its field staff from being infected with Covid-19.This included mandatory body temperature checks for all employees at headquarters, state offices, depots and mustering points before they start work.Those with a temperature reading exceeding 38°C would be sent for medical check-ups immediately, he added.\n",

I was worried about the vaccine and its possible side effects.“I am thankful everything went smoothly today. The whole process was quick and painless. It felt like a mosquito bite. I can still drive home alone to get some rest.”Despite being a diabetic with high cholesterol and hypercoagulability condition, retired security guard Md Razak Yusoff, 69, came all the way from Gelugor to get his vaccine shot.“My niece was kind enough to drive me here from my home. I’m actually excited to get vaccinated and everything went well.“I hope that the public can register themselves and get vaccinated as soon as possible to achieve herd immunity, ” he said.Ow, Ong and Md Razak were among 99 people who joined the government’s vaccination programme held at a private hospital.Pantai Hospital Penang chief executive officer Pan Wen Lek said they assigned between 30 and 50 in-house staff members to help out.“We will offer vaccination to about 100 people from Monday to Friday for six months.“The recipients will also be given a goodie bag consisting of face masks, a face shield and breakfast bun from our bakery, ” he said.The first mega mass vaccination centre at Setia SPICE Arena was also fully operational to dispense the AstraZeneca vaccines.

      "WITH no end in sight to the Covid-19 pandemic, trishaw riders in Penang are pinning their hopes on a speedy vaccination process.Many believe that is the only path out of their crisis.Trishaw rider Khor Ah Hock, 58, hopes herd immunity can be achieved as soon as possible.“If things can return to normal by the end of the year, interstate travel will be allowed and our business can improve, ” he said when met at Armenian Street in George Town recently.“For now, we will hang in there and rely on public generosity to sustain us.”Khor said food donations were hard to come by now due to the spike in Covid-19 cases.The trishaw riders used to get meals from kind people during MCO 1.0.“Now, I have to skip dinner at times and only drink water to keep myself full.“When we get dry items like instant noodles and biscuits from Good Samaritans, we will eat them slowly as we do not know when we will get free food again.“Although we receive a RM100 monthly allowance from the state, half of it will be spent on trishaw rental.“With no tourists arriving in Penang, we have had no income at all for months, ” he said.Khor has made his trishaw his home since he has no family.He takes showers at public toilets or water pipes by the roads at times.“Since I have skin cancer, I have to make sure my wounds are clean to prevent viral infection.“Before the pandemic, there were times when I was too weak to ride during my recovery.“Some tourists were kind enough to give me some money to be their tour guide, ” he said.Another trishaw rider, who wished to be known only as Thua, 62, has had no income at all since the MCO was first implemented in March last year.“I have been riding a trishaw for over 30 years.“Since I am blind in one eye and have leg problems, I was unable to get a new job.“Sometimes, I have to share a meal with my friends here.“I have no choice but to sleep in my trishaw for the time being.“Although there is no business,I still have to pay monthly rent for my trishaw, ” he said.According to Penang Trishaw Riders Association president Abdul Latiff Mohd, 74, there are now only 60 active trishaw riders in Penang.“We used to have more riders but due to the bad times, some had to look for new jobs, ” he said.“We hope the public can help us with cash or dry food items.”In George Town, most riders operate at the Esplanade, Penang Road, Komtar and Armenian Street.\n",

      "CHARITY organisations running shelters for people with disabilities (OKU) are hoping that the government will be able to speed up the Covid-19 vaccination programme for those in this category.According to Johor Baru Handicapped and Mentally Disabled Children Association president S. Murugaiyah, 55 out of its 214 residents have so far been registered with the Welfare Department (JKM).“Registration was done last month and we are yet to get the vaccination date,” he said.Murugaiyah said of the 214residents at the home in Taman Saleng, Indah, Kulai, only 15 were not eligible for vaccination as they were below the age of 18, and the remaining residents would be registered with JKM soon.“At the same time, only 10 out of the 55 caregivers at our shelter have already got a date for their first dose,’’ he added.Murugaiyah hopes the department will quickly provide vaccination dates for the other 45 caregivers as they are dealing with high-risk residents and those with morbidity issues.Ten of the caregivers will be receiving their first dose tomorrow at the shelter, along with 63 residents of VR Melodies Old Folks Home, which is also under the association.Separately, Murugaiyah said donations to the association had declined by 70% since the movement control order was imposed on March 18 last year.“When the economy is bad, charities like ours are among the most affected,” he lamented.The Kulai shelter, he added, needed between RM1.2mil and RM1.9mil a year to take care of 214 residents – 120 males and 94 females aged between six and 50.Murugaiyah explained that the amount was also needed to pay its 55 full-time staff, as well as for utility bills, quit rent and waste collection.Apart from Kulai, the association also has shelters for handicapped children in Banting, Selangor; Bukit Baru, Melaka; Kuantan, Pahang; and Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu.Meanwhile, Johor Area Rehabi-litation Organisation (Jaro) general manager Joseph Roy Arputham said 37 of its employees, aged between 24 to 70, had so far registered with JKM for the vaccination.“We hope to get all our employees vaccinated within the next six months,” he said, adding that JKM had agreed to conduct the vaccination programme at the complex.Joseph also said that the MCO since last year had financially impacted charity organisations.“It is a difficult time not only for charities like us but also for businesses and companies,’’ he said.Prior to the pandemic and MCO, Jaro was able to make around RM500 daily from the sale of handicrafts created by its residents and displayed at the showroom in the complex.The organisation’s average monthly income, Joseph said, had been about RM20,000 from the individual sale of handicrafts, bulk orders from companies and cash donations, but that amount has declined significantly now.“We need funds to operate and despite closing during the first MCO in March last year and the lockdown now, we still have to pay our employees,’’ he added.Jaro was set up in 1952 for tuberculosis patients, but later became a centre for the disabled.\n",

      "The Perak government is expected to make a decision tomorrow over the lack of bus service in Taiping and Kamunting.State infrastructure, energy, water and public transportation committee chairman Datuk Mohd Zolkaply Harun, when contacted, said it would find a solution for commuters relying on public buses and the matter would be decided on Wednesday at the state executive council meeting.He said the state government had the Taiping and Kamunting people’s best interest in mind even though the number of locals using public buses was fewer compared to foreign workers.“There are bus service operators who are willing to ply the routes, and are waiting for the green light from the state government.“We are settling the requirements and will make an announcement soon, ” he said, adding that the buses used would be in good working condition.Residents in Taiping and Kamunting have been restless as there has been no news of a replacement bus service after Rapid Kamunting announced it was ceasing operations by the middle of the month.Many people, especially senior citizens, depend on public buses to go to work, town or the market.They are worried that come June 15, there will be no buses on the road.Commuter Christina Ho said many were panicking as they had not received news on a new bus service to replace the Rapid buses that used to ply routes within Taiping and Kamunting.“We feel that Rapid Kamunting should continue to operate until a new bus service takes over.“We do not want to travel on the old private ‘red bus’ as they are unreliable.“In fact, we don’t even see these buses on the roads now due to the lockdown, ” she said.Recently Rapid Bus Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Prasarana Malaysia Berhad (Prasarana), announcedthat its Rapid Kamunting bus service in Perak was ceasing operations from June 15.Rapid Bus, in a statement, said the decision was due to funding constraints and low demand since the service began in 2016.A commuter, who wished to be known as Madam Choo, said Rapid Kamunting’s buses were wheelchair-friendly.“I go to the market daily with my friends and before the lockdown, we visited the lake gardens often, ” she said adding that they took the bus to these destinations.Those living in Aulong said that the Rapid Kamunting service offered convenience as it was the only public bus to ply that route.Wong Sai Mooi, 70, said it was a pity that Rapid Kamunting was stopping operations as it provided services that accommodated senior citizens.“I am hoping that the state government will be able to provide an equally good bus service to replace Rapid Kamunting, ” she said.\n",

      "Recycling stations run by charity organisations and social enterprises in the Klang Valley have taken precautionary measures to safeguard workers against the Covid-19 pandemic as they sort through items donated by the public.The Salvation Army public relations department senior community manager Algene Tan said steps had been put in place at its receiving warehouses.The charity’s social enterprise arm accepts pre-loved items such as clothing, electrical items, furniture, books and household items that are still in good condition to sell at its Family Thrift Stores for income.Tan said they would ensure that those entering the warehouses have their body temperature taken.“In addition to regular hand washing, they must also always wear face masks.“Thankfully, our premises is large enough to avoid overcrowding and we ensure all employees are physically distanced as they work.“If any employee feels unwell, especially if they display signs of flu, fever or cough, they will not be allowed to enter the premises.“So far, everyone understands the repercussions of flouting the standard operating procedure as most do not want to burden their own families and community by contracting the virus,” she said.Tan added that a sanitising solution was sprayed on most items.However, some things like paper do not get sprayed.“As such, we highly recommend that people clean or wipe their items upon purchase.“Our collection centres in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya arecontactless so donors can safely drop off their items at our cabins,” she said.Social enterprise Bless Shop senior operations manager Tina Chong said it had stopped accepting volunteers to help with sorting at its warehouse.Its retail shop sells pre-loved shoes and clothes in Mid Valley Megamall in Kuala Lumpur.“This is to emphasise the point that everyone should stay home to stop the spread.“Employees are also covered under our group insurance plan, so if there is ever a need for them to undergo coronavirus tests or be hospitalised, they can claim for it,” she added.However, with the lockdown currently in place, Bless and Salvation Army’s warehouses and stores are closed.At Pertubuhan Amal Seri Sinar Kuala Lumpur dan Selangor, its founder and president Datuk Eadon Ching said gloves were mandatory, especially for workers assigned to collect items deposited at the 30 collection bins placed around Klang Valley.The charity has been collecting recyclables like plastic bottles and scrap metals since 2003 to raise funds for the underprivileged.“The workers come in contact with bin door handles, which have been touched by the public.“They are also required to have water in the truck so they can wash their hands.“At the end of a working day, our sorting area is fogged with disinfectant,” he explained.The organisation’s sorting centre is still open but with only 60% manpower for segregation work and collection from its recycling bins.Visitors and in-person donation of items are not allowed at the premises for now.One message that Tan, Chong and Chin are eager to pass on to the public is to refrain from treating the recycling centres, donation bins and pick up cabins as a dumping ground for non-recyclables.“Disposable diapers, sanitary towels, face masks, tissues, carbon paper, sandpaper, paint cans, toxic liquid cans, cups, plates and bulbs are examples of non-recyclables.“Plastic bags, aluminium cans or paper and glass packaging, especially if they have been soiled by dirt or grease, should not be disposed of at such centres either,” they said. — By GRACE CHEN\n",

      "Gamuda Bhd has announced its Green Plan that sets forth tangible targets driven by environmental, social and governance (ESG) dimensions for over the next five years and beyond.The plan, unveiled in conjunction with World Environmental Day this year, commits the entire group to circular construction with specific steps to reduce direct and indirect corporate greenhouse gas emission intensity by 30% in 2025, and by 45% in 2030.Gamuda is building on its foundation of engineering and technology innovation, workplace safety, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and workforce diversity.This is followed by pledges to “Build Right. For Life.” in pursuing nation-building development that balances economic and social growth with a strong environmental stewardship.Over the years, it has mapped various ESG strategies across its business units to create value for the triple bottom line – profit, people and planet.The commitment is also underscored by the group’s decision in 2020 to include sustainability as a key management risk.The Gamuda Green Plan is anchored on four key pillars:Sustainable Planning and Design, Circular Construction – to facilitate sustainable master planning featuring climate-responsive design, integrated transport and super-low-energy buildings with smart features.Our Community and Our Business – to develop talent capabilities and cultivate good governance in ESG.Environmental and Biodiversity Conservation – to drive impactful efforts in nature conservation and biodiversity stewardship in its townships and property developments.Enhancing Sustainability via Digitalisation – to leverage on technology and data management to enhance Group-wide efforts in sustainable development.The “living” document will evolve and realign with policies over time, taking account of latest technological developments and current stakeholder demands.Gamuda Group managing director Datuk Lin Yun Ling said the Green Plan was its commitment to value, mitigate and adapt to climate change.“We must own it and hold with very deep conviction to walk the talk.“By taking a whole-of-group approach, we are empowering our own people to pursue these goals with a structured plan.“By addressing climate change, we are making an effort to leave a positive legacy for our future generations. There’s no alternative, ” he added.As a key feature of the plan,bold targets have been listed for Gamuda’s landmark project, Penang South Islands (PSI).It aims to achieve an overall 50% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, which will play a significant role in transitioning to a low-carbon future.PSI’s Green Tech Park is designed to be 100% powered by renewable energy, posing as a promising hub for emerging low-carbon technologies and enabling decarbonisation at scale.Gamuda Green Plan also outlines various initiatives for its townships to reach 40% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030.These include 35% reduction in urban planning emissions with sustainable master planning, 10% reduction in transport emissions through green mobility plans and low carbon commuting networks, 40% reduction in non-renewable energy use, 65% reduction in freshwater demand and 50% reduction in landfill waste in closing the waste loop.Yayasan Gamuda will scale up the group’s community investment efforts through programmes such as Enabling Academy and Gamuda Scholarship.Gamuda Parks will intensify its biodiversity conservation by establishing a wetlands arboretum with a forest seed bank for native species, as well as developing internal capabilities in the areas of arboriculture and horticulture by partnerships with the indigenous community.Gamuda will also nurture and plant one million trees and saplings through its Advance Tree Planting scheme as part of this initiative.To accelerate progress towards the ambitious targets, the group will fully adopt Digital Industria-lised Building System (IBS) across all its developments, together with other industry players, aligning to the circular construction framework.Lin said Digital IBS was capable of delivering a wide range of construction products through cloud-based Building Information Modelling design models, integrated with precise robotic production.This, he said, would reduce Gamuda’s reliance on foreign workforce and generate less waste – these are key elements of ESG.“Hence, it’s imperative that we increase our productivity and upskill the local workforce and supply chain to enhance sustainability through digital construction, ” he added.\n",

      "THE death of a family member will often leave the rest of the household feeling lost, especially when big decisions have to be made.To help families cope with the ordeal of losing a loved one as well as prepare for mortality, leading bereavement care provider Nirvana Asia Group and tech startup Bereev Sdn Bhd launched their collaboration for Bereev, a web-based death preparation app.The comprehensive and user-friendly app manages the needs of people through a secure online platform in four steps –plan, vault, message and share.Pointing out that Bereev‘s functionality goes beyond convenience and privacy, Nirvana Memorial Park (Central Region) chief operations officer Datin Lee Jye Chyi said the app’s ability to record video, audio, images and text that were electronically stored in advance, was a form of emotional empowerment for the user and loved ones.“Users can compile all the information they want to convey in the form of family photos, videos, e-mail, social media and more in a secure digital vault (in the app).“After the user’s demise, selected loved ones can easily access the information which may include social media and email accounts and passwords.“Last messages, instructions and old photos can also be accessed, ” she said during the virtual launch of the collaboration.A strong advocate of pre-planning, Lee said Nirvana hoped to make it easier for its customers to plan ahead and manage digital assets easily online through Bereev in the spirit of “assuring legacies beyond”.“Nirvana and Bereev share the same concept and promote pre-planning with a careful and caring attitude.“Bereev’s professionalism and technology will contribute to our historic collaboration, ” said Lee.Noting that Bereev was designed to simplify the planning process and ease arrangements for the family post-death, Bereev founder and chief executive officer Izumi Inoue said the partnership with Nirvana aimed to change the way Asians dealt with death.“The biggest goal we want to achieve is to help people think about mortality, have conversations with loved ones about it and make important decisions beforehand.“Most of us would prefer not to think or talk about death but without a plan, our loved ones will end up bearing the consequences in a very difficult time of their life, ” she added.Inoue also said that Bereev was fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation and the Personal Data Protection Act, and that the app was afirst-of-its-kind example of a traditional company working with a tech startup.Moving forward, Nirvana and Bereev will launch a series of campaigns to further meet the needs of both new and existing customers.Meanwhile, existing Nirvana clients in Malaysia’s central region are given free access to Bereev.Access to the app will eventually be expanded to all Nirvana branches nationwide.For for information, visit https://nirvana.bereev.com\n",

      "THERE are about 10,000 residents from approximately 2,500 households who are affected by the enhanced movement control order (MCO) in Bayan Lepas, Penang, said its assemblyman Azrul Mahathir Aziz.He said the residents lived in the 13 localities in the constituency, which have been placed under the enhanced MCO since Friday.“So far, we are doing our best to help all those who are affected in these localities.“We have our own Village Community Management Council (MPKK) members who would be there to assist the Health Ministry and Civil Defence Force personnel, ” he said when met at his operation centre at Surau Kampung Bukit in Bayan Lepas on Saturday.Earlier, Azrul and his service centre members helped to coordinate the distribution of 500 packs of fresh chicken and other essential items to the residents.He said the fresh chickens were contributed by Balik Pulau MP Muhammad Bakhtiar Wan Chik as part of the effort to ease the burden of the residents who were affected.“The distribution of the items will be coordinated by the MPKK team members who stay in the affected localities.”Azrul urged the residents to be patient and to cooperate with the authorities during this period.“When receiving the food aid, please be patient.“If you feel that there are more deserving families who really need the aid, maybe you can let them have it first, ” he said.Azrul said he was confident that the food distribution would be handled smoothly but urged those who were left out to contact him directly or the district office.Resident Mohd Hafizan Abdul Wahid, 33, who lived at the Sri Bayu Apartment, said he and his family have been following the advice of the authorities by staying at home.“There is nothing much that we can do.“For the time being, we will stay at home and if we need supplies, I will go out.“So far, the food aid distribution was conducted in an orderly manner and almost all affected residents received the aid, ” he said.The enhanced MCO is being implemented in Sri Bayu, Bayu Tiara, Bayu Nyaman, Halaman Murni, Bayan Permai, Bayan Tiara, Taman Ara Indah, Kampung Bukit, Kampung Perlis, Kampung Masjid, Jalan Mahkamah, Kampung Pak Lah and Lebuh Kampung Bukit.The decision for the enhanced MCO in the localities was taken after health authorities recorded 83 new cases within two weeks with a total number of positive cases exceeding 250.The enhanced MCO remains in effect until June 17.Meanwhile, lorry driver Sasikumar Selvaraju, 45, said he had been jobless due to the movement restriction under enhanced CMO.“I work in a company which does renovation and now I am unable to travel.“I don’t know whether I can sustain the month of June as I am now out of job, ” said Sasikumar, who is the sole breadwinner in the house, earning RM1,500 a month.He lives in the Bayu Nyaman Apartment, Bayan Lepas, with his wife, who is a housewife and a diabetic.“I am worried my employer will cut my salary when I am back to work.“We could not get aid from the state Welfare Department as we were told that we were not eligible as we don’t have children, ” he said.His wife S. Thilagavathy, 44, said the residents were living in fear as some living in the Sri Bayu apartments, who were wearing pink wrist bands, especially children, could be seen outside the apartment.“Both of us stay home as it is definitely a risk being outside.Nurse Wan Khairulnisah Wan Hassan, 30, said the residents of Sri Bayu Apartments were quarantined as the apartment has the highest number of cases.“We dare not venture out, and keep ourselves locked inside all the time, ” she said.Technician Sukri Kamis, 42, who stays at the Bayu Tiara Apartment, is worried over food supplies.“I have stocked up, but the mini market here has run out of supplies and I am fearful if there will be enough food for the coming week.“It is not safe to go out. Although I am feeling restless, I am staying put just to be on the safe side.Architect Aananthen Ramanaidu, 55, is feeling the pressure of missing the deadline for his project submission in Kuala Lumpur.“My office is at Bukit Dumbar in Jelutong and while I am used to working from home, certain planning with clients on designs could only be done from the office, ” said Aananthen, who lives in Taman Kenyalang running parallel to Jalan Mahkamah, which is barricaded by barbed wires.“I am trying to get a Health Ministry letter to travel and it is going to be an arduous task with the present situation, ” he said.Meanwhile, Balik Pulau OCPD Supt A. Anbalagan said since the enhanced MCO was imposed in 13 localities in the area, no standard operating procedure (SOP) has been violated so far.“So far, the situation is under control. There is no breach or violation whatsoever, ” he said.Supt Anbalagan, however, advised residents to heed the regulations imposed by authorities and to follow all SOP that has been imposed on them.“Police will continue to monitor and enforce the SOP in the localities. We hope that the residents will continue to abide by the regulations.“A total of 60 police officers and personnel are on duty at all 13 localities during this period and they will be assisted by personnel from the army, Civil Defence Force and state Health Department.“Residents can contact the district police or district operation centre for disaster should they have any problems during this period.”\n",

The field will have other facilities like carparks, futsal court, and a multipurpose court, ’’ he said.Mahadi added that the appointment (of a contractor) to build the proposed field and other facilities was expected to start in January next year.Last year, he approved plans to build a football field on the former sports club land for the community.The old football field, he had said, would be restored and equipped with basic facilities, such as toilets with changing rooms and a carpark, during the interim period.The field will have cow grass like the one in Dataran Merdeka and it will be equipped with floodlights to allow for games at night.The mayor had also expressed concern over public safety when he heard that Cruyff Court nearby was being used to play football.In 2016, DBKL announced the temporary closure of Cruyff Court to upgrade existing sports facilities.The DBKL sports club and its football field were demolished on April 18,2017 to make way for a new building costing RM50mil.In June 2018, the project was cancelled by then Kuala Lumpur mayor Tan Sri Mohd Amin Nordin to cut DBKL’s expenditure.Brickfields has lost at least six football fields and green areas in the past 20 years to development.\n",

      "‘WHEN there is a will, there is a way’ is the best proverb to describe the strong will of Suriati Mat Zin, 44, who decided to make a living by selling doughnuts, despite having to depend on a wheelchair to move around.The mother to a 13-year-old girl also bears the responsibility as the sole breadwinner of the family after her husband Zainal Abidin Ayub, 49, was paralysed from waist down after an accident in 2017.Suriati, who lives in Pasir Mas, Kelantan, said the family used to depend solely on her husband’s income as a rubber tapper to make ends meet.“The idea to sell doughnuts came after my husband lost his source of income as he was unable to work due to his condition.“Besides, I do not want to continue depending on other people’s assistance, ” she told reporters at her house in Kampung Batu Karang in Pasir Mas recently.According to Suriati, she was involved in a road accident in 2012 where she broke her right knee that made her incapable of walking but she fully recovered two years later.“Unfortunately, I got into another accident last year when I skidded while riding a motorcycle that led to severe injuries on my legs.“After the second accident, both of my legs became weak and I now use a wheelchair to move about, ” said Suriati, who receives a RM500 monthly aid from the Social Welfare Department.Despite being a person with disabilities, Suriati said she was able to produce about 100 pieces of doughnuts daily with help from her daughter, Aina Zulaikha.Priced at 30sen per piece, the doughnuts are placed at three shops nearby her house and Suriati is glad that they often get sold out.“I start kneading the dough as early as 3am. I am unable to prepare the dough in large quantity because I knead it manually by hand.“Since the accident, I often get tired easily and both of my hands are not strong enough to knead the flour for a long time, ” she said.In the meantime, Suriati said she was hoping for a three-wheeled motorcycle contribution from any kind donor to ease her movement in transporting the doughnuts to the respective shops.Prior to the interview, the family received a visit from Tuan Zaimah Raja Omar, a representative from the Rantau Panjang Third Force, a non-governmental organisation, who handed over cash assistance of RM200 and an automatic kneading machine worth RM1,800. — Bernama\n",

      "SEVERAL non-governmental organisations in Perak are calling for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme to be expedited as the progress is currently too slow.Ipoh City Watch president Prof Dr Richard Ng said health authorities should go down to targeted locations like rural areas or villages, and use community halls to register people for the vaccine and also administer it.“They must understand that many senior citizens are not IT savvy and some are not staying with their children.“There are also those residing at nursing homes. The same goes for people with disabilities.“Thus, more inoculation centres should be set up in all districts for the convenience of the people.“Get volunteers, especially Chinese and Tamil-speaking ones, to help facilitate and call up registered recipients for their injections, ” he said when contacted.Ng feels the current vaccination process needs improvement.“The issues encountered so far include an insufficient number of people to administer the vaccine, and the lack of vaccination centres.“There’s also not enough monitoring in terms of implementation, resulting in many who have registered not being called for vaccination.“Some who were due to be vaccinated did not turn up as they were unaware of their appointment or did not have the MySejahtera app so they could not check the status, especially senior citizens.“The system needs to be improved through a reminder to all recipients, ” he said, adding that those who failed to turn up should be given a stern warning and a fine.Perak health executive council member Mohd Akmal Kamaruddin had reportedly said on May 29 that some 238,000 people under the second phase of the national immunisation programme in the state had received their first dose.Perak has a population of about 2.6 million people.It was also reported that several private hospitals and clinics have been roped in to expedite the vaccination exercise.Family Wellness Club president P. Mangaleswary said it was important that the government look into the reasons why people did not turn up for their jabs.“We are racing against time to get as many people as possible vaccinated.“The government could recruit qualified personnel, including retired nurses or healthcare workers from the private sector, to help out with the vaccination exercise, ” she added.Bank officer Michael Chang, 40, said it was good that people would not be allowed to choose their vaccine as this could hamper the process.“Let’s just focus on achieving the 80% vaccination rate for herd immunity, ” he stressed.Chang also said private hospitals should be allowed to buy and dispense vaccines at their premises.“If this is allowed, people can choose the vaccine they want and pay for it. This will improve the overall vaccination rate in the country, ” he added.\n",

      "Bikers of Libya’s Mediterranean city of Benghazi, the cradle of its 2011 revolution and a one-time Islamist bastion, rev up their motors to show another side to their war-scarred country.In a cocktail of gleaming chrome and rumbling engines, dozens of heavy-duty motorbike enthusiasts in their leathers tear up the asphalt in regular parades through the streets of the wind-strewn city.The convoy of Harley Davidsons, Hondas and Kawasa-kis emerges from the headquarters of the Benghazi Motorcycles Club.For the club’s members, biking is not only a passion, it’s also a way of portraying the city in a different light – a semblance of normality despite Libya’s pervasive divisions and violence.“There are those who fight, and there are those who have a passion, ” the club’s proud president Ahmed al-Fitouri says from behind a thick beard and long hair.“We’ve had French and British crews film us, and we’ve shown them that not all Libyans make war, they’re not all criminals, ” he says.Two by two, the bikers parade through Benghazi’s alleys and main roads, arms perched on the handlebars.Onlookers watch or film and honking car drivers contribute to the cacophony as they ride past war-battered buildings.The motorcycle club, which has a Harley Davidson-inspired eagle as its emblem, boasts 120 members and they are “all enthusiasts”, says Fitouri.It was established in 2014 on the initiative of a group of amateurs, right in the thick of a second battle for control of their city, three years after the fall of Libya’s longtime leader Moamer Kadhafi.Even at that time of rampant insecurity before Islamist militias were expelled, club members staged public shows.Before the revolt that put an end to more than four decades of dictatorship, bikers were “marginalised” members of Benghazi society, says Fakhri Mustapha al-Hassi, the club’s vice president.“But that image has changed, ” says Hassi, a lively character sporting a leather waistcoat and a black bandana.“Now families and children come to have their picture taken with us.”Club members also raise funds for charities, stage “parades for peace” and take part in official functions, such as a recent tribute to Omar al-Mokhtar, a hero of Libya’s resistance to Italian occupation in the early 20th century.During Ramadan, the bikers distributed snacks and drinks to motorists running late for iftar. All this “gives a good image” of the country, club president Fitouri says. – AFP Relaxnews\n",

But more support, he said, is always welcomed.“The programme has received the cooperation of a number of Malaysian celebrities, who have agreed to spread this goodwill message through their social media, which collectively have 15 million followers.Among them are Datuk Eizlan Yusof, Datuk Nancie Foo, Lisa Surihani, Amber Chia, Chai Zi, Revathy and Balan Kash.“Volunteers support Yayasan KRU by uploading and sharing materials on the ‘Kita Jaga Kita’ programme through their respective social media platforms,” elaborated Norman, adding that these media personalities will help increase awareness to various parties to help those in need.“I hope more people will come forward to work together with Yayasan KRU to achieve its initiatives.

      "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) can cause considerable suffering in children and adolescents.In addition, access to effective treatment is limited for many with the disorder, which was previously known as social phobia.Researchers at the Centre for Psychiatry Research at Karolinska Institutet and the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services at Region Stockholm in Sweden, have now shown that internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an efficacious and cost-effective treatment option.SAD has a typical onset during childhood and is characterised by an intense and persistent fear of being scrutinised and negatively evaluated in social or performance situations.The fear typically leads to avoidance of such anxiety-triggering situations or are endured under great distress, resulting in an impaired ability to function in everyday life.The disability can lead to underperformance in school, social isolation from peers and an inability to partake in leisure activities.As one of the most common anxiety disorders among youth, the disorder affects 5% to 10% of the youth population.Without effective treatment, it has been linked to long-term psychosocial adversity and persistence into adulthood.Despite known evidence-based treatments for SAD, such as CBT, the access to effective treatment is very limited.As a means to increase access, the researchers developed and evaluated a 10-week internet-delivered CBT (ICBT) programme for young people with SAD.The study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was conducted between 2017 and 2020, and included 103 youths aged 10 to 17, along with their parents.Participants were randomly assigned to either ICBT or an active control group, which provided internet-delivered supportive therapy.Both interventions included 10 online treatment modules with weekly therapist support and three video sessions with the therapist.Parents received five online modules in parallel with therapist support.The results showed that ICBT was significantly more effective than supportive therapy in reducing social anxiety and concurrent psychiatric symptoms, as well as in increasing the level of overall functioning.The superiority of ICBT was shown in evaluations of participants’ symptoms made by assessors who were unaware of which treatment group the participants were in, as well as in ratings by participants themselves and their parents.According to the researchers, the digital format can also increase access to evidence-based treatment for children and adolescents with SAD.“Offering treatment digitally means that children and parents don’t have to take time off school and work to travel to a healthcare facility,” says psychologist and study first author Martina Nordh.“We also believe it may lower the threshold to seeking treatment, as young people with SAD can find it too challenging to meet with unfamiliar people and to be in a new setting.”The total time spent by the therapists on ICBT was about a quarter of the time normally required by face-to-face CBT for SAD.“Shorter therapist time enables each therapist to treat more patients and may lead to reduction of waiting times,” says child and adolescent psychiatrist and study principal investigator Dr Eva Serlachius.“This also makes digital CBT less costly for healthcare services and resources can be redistributed to those with greater need of more intensive treatment.”The researchers are now working on a joint project with Region Stockholm’s Internet treatment unit within the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services to plan for the implementation and dissemination of the programme via a Swedish national platform.The study was supported by grants from the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, and Region Stockholm.\n",

      "The doors might be bolted yet again for performing arts and live venues due to Covid-19 restrictions.But independent arts space Live Fact and experimental rock band Deepset aren’t sitting idle. They have launched a crowdfunding campaign to help the Petaling Jaya venue survive the difficult months ahead.Live Fact has released a “rockumentary” video titled The Sonic Stories Of Deepset, which captures the band’s virtual performance from the venue last July. Additional band interviews and backstage footage have been stitched together for this 45min short film, which was produced by a video team closely associated with Live Fact.The video accompanies the crowdfunding campaign where Live Fact and Deepset have issued an exclusive live CD and merchandise bundle. The CD features four unreleased Deepset songs, including Ballad Of The Dancing Lunatic and Madness, As You Know.“We might be closed as a venue. But I’m glad that The Sonic Stories Of Deepset video captures the spirit of collaboration. Through the years, I have seen them play countless times, but for this performance - in an empty hall, no audience - they served up a magical set. They offered to help us in our darkest time and that glow of hope, as cheesy as it might sound, really lifted us,\" says Mak.\"This also isn't a story of one band and one venue. Independent venues are entry points into the arts and music scene, not only for bands but also for sound engineers, photographers, filmmakers, lighting crews, designers and others. We want to show that people can make a difference.“At Live Fact, we have been very lucky. The bands, artists and fans who have been with us from day one have not abandoned us, and that sort of support has kept us going during this pandemic, ” he adds.Deepset’s online show at Live Fact last year managed to raise RM20, 000, a sum which was divided between venue and band. For The Sonic Stories Of Deepset video project, Mak says everybody involved was also paid.“It’s a long road ahead. Pandemic recovery timeframes are meaningless when you can’t get back to work. A venue cannot open, a band cannot play. It's a demoralising time, but we have to stick together, help each other out, ” says Mohammad Asshad, Deepset bassist.\"We have built a strong relationship with the Live Fact people. In many ways, it's more than just a venue. It's 'home' for many people in the fringe music scene. If we manage to keep Live Fact alive, we also keep an entire network of bands and creative people going... it will take a lot of hard work, but when community comes together, things can happen,\" he adds.\n",

      "Disturbing odours, annoying pollen and now virus-laden aerosols: drivers value clean air inside their car more than ever, especially since the beginning of the pandemic.The car industry has long since picked up on this trend and is coming up with more and more elaborate air-conditioning systems.Mercedes’ new electric model EQS, for example, has an innovative air-conditioner in the front, in a space occupied by the engine in conventional cars.Here, the manufacturer has installed a so-called Hepa filter which provides clinical air quality like in an operating room, according to Mercedes.The EQS boot has a volume of 610 to 1,770 litres, more than any other Mercedes S-Class model and more than enough to make up for the lost storage space in the front. However, the placement also shows the importance now attributed to air conditioning.Filter capacity: 150 football fields“While this was initially a very big issue in Asia in particular, it has also become a top priority in the rest of the world since the coronavirus at the latest, ” says Mercedes’ Christoph Starzynski, justifying the installation of a filter that is larger than a crate of beer and separates 99.65% of particles of all sizes on a surface the size of 150 football fields.But Mercedes isn’t the only manufacturer that has ramped up the fight against dirty air. For years, developers were concerned with the perfect distribution of air flows in the car and the most individualised comfort zones possible for each occupant.But now it’s increasingly about purity: modern air-conditioning systems detect air quality and automatically activate recirculation mode, they ionize the air flow to eliminate odours, and they are now filtering out ever smaller particles as well.Regulating clean air via your smartphoneBritish manufacturer Rolls-Royce, for example, claims it has installed the first automatic climate control system with a nanoparticle filter in its new Ghost model last year, a system that since this spring has also been available for some luxury models at BMW.“This technology makes it possible to keep certain microbial particles and allergens out of the vehicle interior in addition to ultra-fine dust, ” says press spokesperson Bernhard Ederer.In recirculation mode, the interior is thus cleaned of almost all particles beyond the usual level. And the driver doesn’t even have to be in the car to switch it on. Thanks to remote access via an app, the air-conditioning system can be programmed accordingly even before you start driving.But clean air is also increasingly available in lower-price ranges. Japanese manufacturer Honda, for example, has launched an interior filter which can be purchased additionally and installed by an authorized dealer.The device “effectively filters, captures and suppresses toxic environmental gases as well as inorganic and biological particles and aerosols, ” according to Honda.Maintenance and additional consumption – but it’s worth itWhile manufacturers have been doing the most to increase air quality inside the car, drivers still have to do their part, says Hans-Georg Marmit from the KUeS car expert association.“Because an air conditioning system is only as good as its maintenance, ” warns the expert, referring emphatically to the manufacturers’ service intervals, during which coolant is checked and filters are replaced.A little extra cost during operation must also be factored in since the air conditioner increases consumption by up to 2 litres, depending on load and performance.But this is money well spent and not only because air conditioners protect against viruses, pollen and bad odours and prevent fungal growth in the car’s windpipes, says Marmit: “Especially in summer, activating the air conditioning is absolutely necessary to ensure the driver’s ability to concentrate.” – dpa/Thomas Geiger\n",

      "Divers and turtles have one thing in common: decompression sickness. When caught in the nets of fishermen, turtles are at risk of dying due to an overly quick ascent to the surface. So the Fondation Oceanográfic in Valencia, Spain has developed a system for taking these turtles in and treating them after these fishing accidents.On the occasion of World Oceans Day on June 8, AFP takes a closer look at this process in this feature \"Protecting the planet one step at a time\" in partnership with the NGO Energy Observer Solutions.Welcome to Valencia and the largest aquarium in Europe, which is home to the Fondation Oceanográfic. Four researchers have set up a clinic there to rescue turtles caught up in fishing nets.Global warming causes upset among the turtle populationFor some years, Spain has seen an influx of loggerhead turtles along its shores. With rising temperatures in the Mediterranean, the nesting area for these creatures has gradually shifted across from Greece and Turkey to Spain.With the resulting increase in turtles in Spanish waters, the fishermen are finding an increasing number of these creatures in their nets.Indeed, the turtles surface too quickly and end up suffering from decompression sickness, and the human population does not always know how to react to them when they are disoriented.The Fondation Oceanográfic in Valencia was the first to highlight this issue, which results in the demise of a great many of these creatures.A special clinicTo deal with this situation, the clinic's scientists have invested in a hyperbaric chamber. The chamber enables the team to artificially lower them back down to a depth of water their bodies can cope with. Using this device, the turtles can be completely cured after a period of 12 to 18 hours.Since 2016, the Foundation has rescued around a hundred turtles a year. By raising awareness about their plight and issuing an emergency number for people to call, their rescue process is becoming increasingly effective.Before being released back into the wild, turtles are tagged so as to track their movements in real time and predict where the next egg-laying event will occur.Energy Observer is the name of the first hydrogen-powered, zero-emission vessel to be self-sufficient in energy, advocating and serving as a laboratory for ecological transition.

      "There are about 500,000 births annually in Malaysia.As some pregnancies end up in miscarriages, it would be reasonable to assume that there are about 600,000 pregnancies annually.The jury is still out on some pundits’ prediction that there will be an increase in pregnancies this year (2021) due to the movement control order, although the Chief Statistician did report that there was actually a decrease in the number of babies born in the first quarter of the year.The information in this article is from international reviews.The current evidence suggests that the likelihood of pregnant women getting Covid-19 is similar to that of other healthy adults.About two-thirds of the infected pregnant have no symptoms (i.e. are asymptomatic).Most of the infected have mild symptoms like that of the common cold or flu.However, a small number can get moderate to severe disease.Pregnant women with Covid-19 may be at increased risk of severe disease compared to the non-pregnant, especially during their last trimester (three months) of pregnancy.As a precaution, the pregnant have been included in the list of those at moderate risk of Covid-19 in most countries.No reported ill effectsPregnant women in Malaysia are eligible to be registered for Covid-19 vaccination.As vaccination is currently voluntary, it is their choice to either go ahead and be vaccinated, or await more information about the vaccines.In my last column, I discussed how Covid-19 could potentially affect pregnant women and newborns.Those factors are among those that should be considered when pregnant women make their decision as to whether or not to get vaccinated.Pregnant women were not included in any of the clinical trials that tested the safety and effectiveness of the various Covid-19 vaccines.This means that information about the effects of such vaccination in pregnancy is limited.As such, no one can be 100% sure whether or not the vaccines will cause adverse events in pregnancy.This uncertainty has to be considered against the risk of developing Covid-19 while pregnant.A small number of women who received the vaccines in the trials did however subsequently became pregnant.No safety problems were reported in those cases.Data from the United States, where about 90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated (mainly with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines), have not raised any safety concerns.Covid-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients known to be harmful to either pregnant women or the fetus.Animal studies have also shown no evidence that the vaccine causes harm to the pregnancy.Furthermore, pregnant women have been receiving vaccines like tetanus toxoid, influenza and pertussis, without any reported harm to their foetuses.The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine triggers an immune response with SARS-CoV-2 viral spike proteins produced within the body from mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) strands that are part of the vaccine.The AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine works the same way, except that it uses DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) strands instead of mRNA.The Sinovac vaccine is an inactivated vaccine, i.e. it consists of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles that have been killed.These vaccines all do not contain the live virus, hence they cannot infect the pregnant woman or her foetus.According to the Government, pregnant women in Malaysia will be offered the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, but not the AstraZeneca/Oxford or Sinovac ones.Rare side effectsVaccination is effective in preventing disease.Even if one gets infected with Covid-19 despite being vaccinated, the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death is minimised.Vaccination itself will not cause Covid-19.Side effects from vaccination are common in the general population.They include pain at the injection site, muscle ache, headache, fatigue and joint ache.Allergic reactions, which are very rare, occur in those with a history of allergy.These side effects have not been reported to have affected pregnancy.Media focus on blood clots (thrombosis) with Covid-19 vaccines have caused unnecessary anxiety and fear.The European Medicines Agency estimates that the risk of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) after receiving the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine is 5.0 (on average from a range of 4.3 to 5.8) per million people.University of Oxford Academic Clinical Fellow Dr Maxime Taquet and colleagues recently reviewed US data from more than a million people.Of those diagnosed with Covid-19, the incidence of CVT was 39 per million people.In those who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna), the incidence was 4.1 per million.The risk of CVT therefore, was 10 times higher in Covid-19 patients, compared with those who were vaccinated.The normal risk of thrombosis in the pregnant in Malaysia ranges from 500 to 2,000 per million.Vaccine timingVaccination early in pregnancy offers early protection.As pregnancy lasts nine months, the question is whether there is still protection at the end of the pregnancy as there is still uncertainty about the duration of protection after completion of the two-dose vaccines.Vaccination after the first trimester (three months) offers better protection against Covid-19, which has been associated with more complications in the third trimester.The first trimester is a time when foetal development occurs and the risk of miscarriage is highest.Although there is a lack of evidence that the Covid-19 vaccines affect foetal development, it is recommended that vaccination begins after the first trimester.This prudent approach avoids suspicion of links, even if coincidental, between vaccination, pregnancy and foetal harm.It is possible to continue the second vaccine dose in women who conceive soon after receiving their first dose.However, the second dose can also be delayed until after the end of the first trimester.The second dose of the current mRNA vaccines have been delayed up to 12 weeks after the first dose in several countries because of availability issues, without significant impact on protection of the recipients.However, whether this effect in the general population is also applicable to the pregnant is an unanswered question.There is currently no data on delaying the second dose with the Sinovac and Sputnik V vaccines.This problem may be resolved by the single-dose vaccines, e.g. Johnson & Johnson and CanSino, which are yet to be registered in Malaysia.Take home messageA discussion with your attending doctor will be helpful in addressing any questions about Covid-19 vaccination in pregnancy.It is important to avoid anyone who has symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 even after vaccination.It would also be prudent to adhere to the non-pharmacological interventions of:Physical distancing, particularly in the third trimesterFace mask-wearingFrequent handwashing with water and soap, or hand sanitising with minimum 60% alcohol-based hand sanitiserAvoidance of crowds, confined spaces and close contactsProper coughing and sneezing etiquetteStaying home as much as possible, andSeeking medical attention promptly

      "Just the thrill of hearing Michael Giacchino's stirring fanfare for the Marvel Studios intro before the start of The Falcon And The Winter Soldier (TFATWS) would have been enough for this unabashed Marvel Zombie to slap a glowing review on this six-episode miniseries.Once, perhaps. Pre-Blip, maybe.And by \"Blip\", I mean the forced changes in lifestyle, mobility and perspective brought on by this awful pandemic which, if anything, have left many of us more cynical, more critical, and less trusting of people, institutions and authority... well, just about everything.TFATWS has all the hallmarks of a Marvel Cinematic Universe blockbuster and sometimes seems way too large to be confined to the dimensions of a tablet (on which I binged this, since I don't have a \"smart\" enough TV to run Disney+ Hotstar).It's a buddy show, has a whole lot of individual arcs, is loaded with action and humour, follows its numerous comic-book sources rather faithfully, and has plenty of visual and musical callbacks to pivotal moments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Not forgetting a multitude of Easter eggs, pop culture references (a Beverly Hills Cop II reference within the first half hour?), grandstanding speeches and \"aww, gee\" bonding moments.Familiar characters return (Emily VanCamp's Agent 13, for one, and Miss \"Move, or you will be moved\" from Civil War), new characters show up (including one who could only be played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus), new locations are introduced (like Madripoor, a wretched hive of scum and villainy known in the comics as a hangout for Wolverine!).There's a lot in there to please fans, courtesy of series creator Malcolm Spellman (Empire) and his writing team (which includes John Wick creator Derek Kolstad, who pens the show's most shocking episode).And with just one director (TV veteran Kari Skogland) helming the whole show, there is the polish to be expected of her experience, and a consistency in tone.Yet with so much in here, TFATWS also stumbles from uneven pacing, strangely placed interludes, and some pretty obvious arbitrary writing that calls its main character's judgment into question.Set a few months after the events of Avengers: Endgame, TFATWS begins with Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), a.k.a. the Falcon, returning the shield bestowed on him by Steve Rogers to the US government.Working as a free agent to handle cross-border \"issues\", Sam also has his hands full as a civilian trying to help his sister and her two young sons save the struggling family business.This raises some interesting questions about whether or not superheroes get paid, and the financial straits of the Wilson family do not really ring true.Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the Winter Soldier, is also on his own, attending mandatory therapy sessions as a condition of his pardon (from all the bad stuff he did under Hydra's control).He has a list of names of people who suffered as a result of his wetwork, and is trying to make amends – not too successfully – one name at a time.It's a very different world out there in the MCU, with millions displaced by the Blip (first from the Thanos snap and then the Bruce Banner one).An international entity known as the Global Repatriation Council has arisen to repatriate those millions, and as is often the case, resorts to \"impartial\" enactments and military force to do so.Those affected will not go quietly into resettlement camps, however, and a rebel anti-patriotic organisation known as the Flag Smashers (comic-book root: the Flag-Smasher, a Captain America foe) is carrying out acts of terror to get its message out to the world.The message: One World, One People, not the worst slogan after someone like Thanos came a-calling.Not too out of sync with the wobbly orbit of our own broken world either, but the parallels are not drawn clearly enough to matter.As mentioned earlier, there are a number of arcs here. Aside from Sam and Bucky's, we also have that of Karli Morgenthau (Erin Kellyman), the leader of the Flag Smashers, supposedly struggling with her conscience and having a semblance of... something remaining that makes Sam think she is worth saving.We'll get to that later.The other main arc involves John Walker (Wyatt Russell), the new Captain America who is chosen by the US government to take up the shield and role.Like Sam, he has no Super-Soldier serum and relies only on his natural ability and training to get by – and inevitably feels incredible pressure from both his role and the super-powered villains he has to fight.These four characters' paths intersect, they clash, and for the most part, you can figure what makes them tick and even be somewhat sympathetic towards their respective struggles.Daniel Bruhl returns as Zemo from Civil War, though his role here is not so much a character arc as it is the juicy chance to play twisted Jiminy Cricket to the major dramatis personae.Where TFATWS stumbles, though, is in the enormous burden it places on Sam Wilson's shoulders. In addition to his personal struggles, Sam also has to cope with the show's attempt to deal with race politics and his own journey towards becoming worthy of claiming the shield.\"They will never let a Black man be Captain America,\" one embittered soul tells him at one point, while two white police officers seeing an out-of-costume Sam arguing with Bucky in the street immediately presume the black man is the aggressor.This is a lot, even in an \"extended feature\" like TFATWS, and as part of the creative team's perception of Sam's nobility, Karli's redemption sort of becomes his pet side project.Does every Cap have to save a soul from the brink? It was very different with Steve Rogers and Bucky, though, given their history. Karli is just... some random butcher, to be honest.She is frequently portrayed as a callous murderer (\"His life doesn't matter to me,\" she coldly tells someone whose best friend she just killed), with Sam often witnessing her acts, and thus his determination to \"save\" her only makes the viewer question his judgment.Yes, he is stubborn in doing what he thinks is right, but the way the writers manipulate the whole Karli-GRC-Cap-Falcon conflict just makes him look stupidly obstinate.Still, the joys of TFATWS eventually outweigh its miscalculations and missteps.The buddy-adventure aspect is fun, thanks to the by-now-familiar chemistry of Mackie and Stan; Russell adds an intriguing, layered and aggressive dynamic to the mix; and some interesting groundwork is laid for wherever Marvel Studios intends to take these characters next.Just... take those blinkers off Sam, next time.All six episodes of The Falcon And The Winter Soldier are available on Disney+ Hotstar.\n",

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "AGENCY\n",
      "Farmers in western France are doubling down on an unusual crop: breeding millions of tiny predatory bugs and wasps to protect tomato plants without resorting to the insecticides that consumers are shunning.\"Here, we're in one of the greenhouses for a bug that's called the macrolophus,\" says Pierre-Yves Jestin, as clouds of the pale green insects swarm around his hands.Jestin is president of Saveol, the Brittany cooperative that is France's largest tomato producer, cranking out 74,000 tonnes a year.For several years the cooperative has promoted \"pesticide-free\" harvests in response to growing concerns about the impact of harsh chemicals on humans and the environment.It does so thanks to its own bug farm, launched in 1983, that now stretches across 4,500sq m (just over one acre) outside Brest, where the tip of Brittany juts out into the Atlantic.Plans are in the works to add 1,200sq m more this year, producing macrolophus as well as tiny wasps that feed on common tomato pests such as whiteflies and aphids.Every week the insects are packed up in plastic boxes and shipped to the cooperative's 126 growers.\"This new extension will allow us to increase our breeding of macrolophus, which are increasingly in demand for the pesticide-free range,\" said Roselyne Souriau, head of the insect programme at Saveol, whose name means 'sunrise' in the local Breton language.\"At the same time, it will let us develop a new range – at least we hope – better suited to strawberries, with parasitic micro-wasps that feed on aphids,\" she said.A third wayBecause the vast majority of Brittany's tomatoes are grown in greenhouses, they do not qualify for an organic label, which requires plants to be grown under natural conditions in the ground.That prompted Saveol to team up with two other Brittany cooperatives, Sica and Solarenn, two years ago to promote their pesticide-free offerings.\"In 2020, we didn't use any chemical treatments at all,\" said Francois Pouliquen, whose eight hectares at the Saveur d'Iroise farm are part of the Saveol network.\"Consumers are now looking to eat healthily,\" he said. \"Organic produce exists of course, but it isn't always within reach for people on a budget. Pesticide-free is an alternative, a third way, for mass production that is still healthy,\" he said.Overall, use of predatory insects by French farmers has soared, with regulators approving 330 species as plant pest treatments in the first quarter of this year, up from 257 in 2015, according to the agriculture ministry.At Saveol's insect farm, the predatory bugs feast on moth eggs spread over hundreds of tobacco plants, which are in the same family as tomatoes and eggplants.The broad leaves make it easy when workers cut the tops off the plants and shake the insects into a giant metal funnel for packing.Some 10 million macrolophus and 130 million micro-wasps are produced each year, and Saveol claims it is the only growers' cooperative in Europe with its own insect-raising facility. – AFP Relaxnews\n",

      "For decades, the iconic roadster driven by Elvis Presley was doing nothing but gathering rust in storage. But now the rock 'n' roll legend's former BMW has finally been restored and has gone on display in a Munich museum dedicated to famous German cars.The King's original BMW 507 roadster has joined the classic car exhibits in Bavaria's Motorworld museum and events space, located in an impressive former railway repair factory in Munich, the same city where BMW has its headquarters.Visitors can do their own renditions of Elvis songs next to his old convertible, however according to a spokeswoman, the karaoke plans are on hold for the time being due to pandemic restrictions.After many years in the US, the car's arrival in Munich has brought it closer to home, as it was not only made in Germany, but purchased there too.According to BMW, Presley bought the 150-horsepower car in Frankfurt shortly after he began his military service in 1958 and sold it again in the US about two years later.Elvis reportedly changed the colour of his roadster to red after female fans kept writing him messages on the car's white paint job.Elvis later sold on the car for US$3,500 (RM14,400), after which it changed hands several times and ended up in storage in California for decades.It was restored to its original design by BMW Group Classic between 2014 and 2016. - dpa\n",

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "AGENCY\n",
      "On a hot May afternoon, Kanta Prasad and his wife Badaami Devi make for a picture of despair as they wait for customers at Baba ka Dhaba, a nondescript roadside eatery in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar. The sight is a far cry from just a few months ago when a social media campaign, which saw help pouring in from across the country, seemed poised to end their troubles.Prasad and his dhaba had become famous overnight last year after a city YouTuber shared a video showing the octogenarian Prasad in tears, telling him how he struggled to make ends meet as business dried up.The viral video led to thousands of people making a beeline to the couple's eatery for food, selfies and donating money.Soon, he opened a new restaurant, added a new floor to his house, settled his old debts and bought smartphones for himself and his children. However, life has since come a full circle, as the new restaurant closed in February and Prasad and his wife are now back at their old dabha where the sales, which saw a 10-fold jump after the initial YouTube video in October, have slumped drastically over the past few months.Prasad said the fourth Covid-19 wave in Delhi, which forced the closure of their old dhaba for 17 days and further affected the sales, have led them to penury – again.\"The daily footfalls at our dhaba have declined because of the ongoing Covid lockdown, and our daily sales have come down from Rs3,500 (RM198) before the lockdown to Rs1,000 (RM56.60) now. The income is not sufficient for our family of eight,\" said a dejected Prasad, as he waited for customers.There are some signs from his glory days. The old dhaba, that looked like a portacabin, now has three CCTV cameras and the live footage can be accessed on Prasad's smartphone. And a fancy board atop displays the dhaba's name, the year it was established, photographs of the elderly couple, two mobile numbers, and proclaims Indian and Chinese menu for lunch and dinner. However, the dhaba currently serves only Indian food such as rice, pulses, and two types of vegetables – the same menu that the couple had at their dhaba before the viral video earned them fame – for lunch and it closes before dinner.Prasad had opened his new restaurant with much fanfare on a cold December morning and for the first few days, it was a roaring success. Unlike at the dhaba where Prasad rolled out rotis for his customers, he and his wife and their two sons sat behind a new gleaming counter, collecting payments as his employees – two cooks and waiters – flitted about serving customers. For a while, it seemed the octogenarian's pains were a thing of the past.After the initial frenzy, customers, however, started disappearing slowly and soon, the expenses were more than the income.Prasad said he invested Rs5 lakh (RM28,300) in the restaurant and hired three workers. The monthly expenditure was around Rs1 lakh (RM5,661) – Rs35,000 (RM1,981) towards rent; Rs36,000 (RM2,037) to pay salaries of three employees; and Rs15,000 (RM849) for electricity and water bills, and to procure food ingredients.\"But the average monthly sales never crossed Rs40,000 (RM2,264). I had to bear all the losses. In hindsight, I feel we were wrongly advised to open a new restaurant,\" he said.The new enterprise collapsed in three months.\"Of the total investment of Rs5 lakh, we managed to recover only Rs36,000 from the sale of chairs, utensils, and cooking machines, after the restaurant shut down,\" said Prasad, blaming Tushant Adlakha, a social worker who, he said, had encouraged and helped him to open the new restaurant at a rented place.\"Essentially it was he (Adlakha) and his team who managed and supervised everything, including the investment and sales. He said he would make it a success, but he never gave enough time for the restaurant,\" said Prasad.But Adlakha denied the allegations and blames Prasad and his two sons for the new restaurant's failure.\"From setting up the restaurant to bringing customers and orders for home delivery of food, we did everything. What else could we do? Prasad's two sons took charge of the restaurant, but they hardly ever stayed at the counter. There were enough orders for home delivery, but the two failed to deliver them,\" he said.In November, Prasad had filed a cheating case against YouTuber Gaurav Wasan, who had shot the viral video of the octogenarian's plight. Prasad alleged that Wasan had collected large sums of money from good Samaritans, but handed him only a small part of it.Wasan denied the allegations and claimed that he gave to Prasad all the donations he had received. Prasad's allegations against the YouTuber polarised opinion on social media, with many saying that he was unfairly targeting his benefactor.Wasan said he held no grudge but was hurt by Prasad's allegation questioning his selfless motive.\"I was heartbroken and was mentally stressed for a couple of months, as the allegations had affected my reputation. Baba has since called me a few times on my mobile phone but I never responded. I have moved on,\" said Wasan.Prasad and his wife, on the other hand, claimed that they still do not know how much money was collected from the people by Wasan. A senior police officer, who did not want to be named, said,\"The investigation into the case is still on.\"Prasad's wife Badaami Devi said they are back to square one. \"All our money is gone. Our children are unemployed and we are old and cannot run the dabha anymore. We hope the government will help us in some way,\" she said, as Prasad nodded in agreement.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) senior leader Somnath Bharti, who is also the MLA from Malviya Nagar, attributed Prasad's failure to multiple reasons, including his inexperience in handling fame and success, and managing the financial assistance and resources he got through various channels.\"I personally believe that there should be a proper system in place when it comes to helping people like Prasad. Expecting an old man like him to start a new business is always risky as there will be people who would try to get benefits out of their situation and circumstances. That's why I feel that help should come through a proper channel and the objective is to help such people grow. I had also offered to help Prasad and I am still available – both in my personal capacity and through the Delhi government,\" said Bharti. – Hindustan Times, New Delhi/Tribune News Service\n",

      "K-pop mega boy band BTS' leader RM has released a self-written song, Bicycle, based on his love of riding his bike around Seoul.The breezy track, released on Monday (June 7), features RM rapping and singing in Korean and English. It is his first solo track since 2018's chart-topping Mono.In a post on the band's blog, the 26-year-old said he had always wanted to write a song about bicycles, adding that he \"literally wrote the lyrics while riding (his) bicycle\".\"My heart always flutters when I ride a bicycle, but whenever I place my two feet on the pedals, I also always feel a bit sad. Maybe it's because there are many things I miss... I, too, don't quite know the reason.\"He also said that he felt free when riding a bike, adding: \"Perhaps it's because I don't have a driver's licence yet, so I've never driven a car before.\"I wanted to transfer that hazy scenery, which always remained out of reach as I rode my bicycle ever since my trainee days, to a song. Those sad but exciting, slightly cold but also warm feelings.\"RM has had a hand in writing BTS' hits, including the latest smash Butter.

      "For more than a year, The Associated Press has been bringing us “One Good Thing” – stories highlighting good deeds done by individuals to brighten others’ days during trying times.Usually, their stories don’t end there. They keep volunteering their time, energy and resources to help people in need, even if their own lives were also turned upside down by a pandemic that has killed and sickened millions around the world. Sometimes they’ve received recognition for their service, or seen support and donations roll in as a result of the publicity.Recently, we checked in with several of those heroes and updated their stories.In February, we brought you the story of Bonifaz Díaz. He biked in and around the Guatemalan highlands city of Quetzaltenango with his saddlebags filled with donated books to barter for an oatmeal-like cereal mix, Incaparina, that an NGO was using to feed nearly 400 children in need.Díaz is still covering around 150km per week in the city at a lung-busting 2,330m above sea level. Mostly, he makes his trips in the morning because it’s the rainy season and storms typically roll in in the afternoon. He figures he collects about 36kg of Incaparina a week, enough to keep the malnutrition programme going.Díaz had worried that the barter donations could dry up as pandemic lockdowns eased in the country, but the opposite turned out to be the case: Donor interest has surged, three other cyclists have joined him since February, and a local cycle shop is now doing maintenance on their bikes for free.“My fear was that once they started being less afraid (of the coronavirus), people wouldn’t feel as committed, ” Díaz said. “But the project has been getting stronger because people participate.”Even as he hopes to return to work in the coming weeks at the theatre company he co-founded – shut down for more than a year due to the pandemic – he intends to keep the barter project up and running.“I feel that there’s reason for it to exist even without the pandemic, ” Díaz said. “The problem of child malnutrition is always latent.”Flourishing food pantryDespite her own coronavirus-related struggles, including a lost job and overdue rent on her martial arts studio, Sofia Moncayo spearheaded a New York City food distribution programme as it ballooned to serve hundreds of people suddenly struggling to stave off hunger.After the AP’s story was published three months ago, more people came forward wanting to support the project, organised through the Mosaic West Queens church and community centre, Moncayo said recently by email.Touring musicians David Shenton and Erin Shields, the subjects of another story, assembled a cast of Broadway stars and celebrities for a benefit concert that raised about US$6,000 (RM24,735) for the pantry in a single evening, Moncayo said.The Kelly Clarkson Show donated US$5,000 (RM20,612) for the pantry and also paid for Moncayo, Shields and another volunteer to go on an upcoming vacation to the Bahamas in appreciation for their efforts. And LaGuardia Community College invited Moncayo to speak at 2021 commencement ceremonies.Moncayo said that with a federal farm-to-families food programme ending this month, the pantry is looking to boost its US$20,000 (RM82,450) monthly budget to US$30,000 (RM123,675) to keep up with demand.“The work at the food pantry continues, ” she wrote, “and our fundraising efforts are more important than ever.”Flying for a causeTJ Kim, a high school junior and aviator living in McLean, Virginia, was recognised as one of 10 noted youth volunteers in the country. His accomplishment: after-school missions flying more than 90,000 items of gloves, masks, gowns and other personal protective equipment to 20 rural hospitals in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia.The distinction – awarded during a virtual celebration last month – came with a US$7,500 (RM30,919) scholarship and a US$5,000 (RM20,612) grant to a nonprofit of Kim’s choice. With India in crisis as the world’s pandemic epicentre, he plans to give the grant to an organisation doing Covid-19 relief work in the South Asian nation.Kim devised Operation Supplies Over the Skies, or Operation SOS, as a way to help the community and keep himself active after his lacrosse season was shut down. The response he got from hospital staffers was rewarding, and he plans to continue making deliveries even after the pandemic eases or ends altogether.“I’ve always said from the beginning that as long as there’s a need, ” Kim said, “I’m going to keep flying.” – AP\n",

      "A fleet of 40 traditional dhow boats are being renovated for tourists in Qatar as the country prepares to host the 2022 World Cup.The excursion boats once used for pearl diving, fishing and transporting goods are to take off from the Doha’s central Dhow Harbour, today a key landmark of the Qatari capital marked by a prominent clamshell monument.The country’s tourism authority says the restorations, set to be ready by October 2021, will preserve the boats’ authentic traditional exteriors while adding facilities for a more fun trip out on the water and solar power to replace fuel.The city also wants to modernise its harbours and jetties as part of major efforts to spruce up its infrastructure for the expected onslaught of visitors during the 2022 FIFA World Cup football tournament.Traffic on the Corniche waterfront promenade leading from the harbour, and at other popular locations in Doha, is notoriously congested. But Qatar has also been building a new metro system especially for the football world’s biggest event.Five of the eight stadiums being used for the tournament will be reachable on the new network. Two of the stadiums have already opened.FIFA has been trumpeting the fact that none of the stadiums are more than 55km apart, making it possible for fans to attend two matches in one day.FIFA has also confirmed that there will be designated fan zones during the tournament. And possibly the most important detail for football fans: alcohol will be served inside these zones.Since about 80% of hotel rooms will be occupied by FIFA during the tournament, Qatar will be laying on cruise ships, among other things, for tourists to sleep in. There will even be the option of sleeping in the desert – or if that sounds a bit extreme, you can always go there on a day trip instead.Qatar’s announcements of new tourist infrastructure have been marred by human rights issues surrounding the conditions of migrant workers during construction work ahead of next year’s world cup.British newspaper The Guardian has said that 6,500 migrant workers from five Asian countries have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010.There have been calls to boycott the Qatar World Cup while the host nation has said reforms have taken place and the deaths are not excessive given the size of the workforce from those countries. – dpa\n",

      "Our perception of calorie content can be distorted by the temperature of a dish, whether warm or cold.This could lead us to eat more.According to a study from France, our brain perceives a cold dish to be lighter in calories than a warm dish.The majority of people who choose a cold dish tend to consume more calories (+31%), fat (+37%) and carbohydrates (+22%).But how can this unconscious decision made by our brain be explained?To answer this question, three researchers from Grenoble Ecole de Management conducted a survey of 2,600 French, American and Brazilian adults of all ages.One of the study’s authors, Amanda Pruski Yamim, offered a first element of explanation for this observation in a press release.“In most cultures, warm foods are considered filling and play an important role in the day’s main meals.“This perception comes from the fact that humans digest hot foods more easily and expect warm food to be tastier,” she outlines.And so for a tastier meal, we are willing to pay more.The study reports that survey participants would be willing to pay up to 25% more for a food item when it was served (or simply labelled) hot.“These observations are essential for people with weight problems or suffering from obesity,” says the researcher, who advises adding a warm food item to a cold dish to increase the feeling of satiety. – AFP Relaxnews\n",

Lyrics video: “Thanks for giving me views. Please continue! How you like that that that that..., ” referring to Blackpink’s hit song How You Like That.After all the 38-year-old performer stated on Instagram that the moral of the song is: “Don't play play with rich people, they can PIAK your face anytime they want, even in the steamboat restaurant.\"It was reported that Namewee later shared this on another post as well: “(Blackpink) fans are really united and have strong mobilisation capabilities (but) it’s a pity that they don’t even understand what the song is trying to express\".Luckily for him, the message got through to some fans like this netizen who wrote: “This song is basically targeting a certain rich group in Malaysia telling how this group is bullying others in Malaysia. It is not disrespectful to women.”The official music video is not available on YouTube currently, but it can be viewed on his Instagram account.In separate news, Namewee shared that two of his other music videos – You Don't Know Me and Alzheimer's Love – received recognition at the Telly Awards (see below).\n",

I love everything Harry Potter,\" said Juarez, wearing the scarlet and gold scarf of the house of Gryffindor.Large crowds gathered outside the store throughout the morning, with even a few police officers called to ensure order was maintained, as Potterheads waited for their timed ticket entry.Inside, fans of J. K Rowling's magical world snapped selfies in front of a red telephone box like the one that transports witches and wizards to the Ministry of Magic, and bought fizzing whizbees candy.They tried on knitted quidditch jumpers, flicked through copies of the best-selling book series in history and sampled the wizards' favorite drink at the Butterbeer bar.\"Butterbeer is like cream soda but with a kick to it. It's unlike anything, honestly,\" explained 21-year-old Emilee Rodriguez.The flagship store was due to open last summer but was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.For 19-year-old Alexandra Ewing, the wait for her first visit to a Potter store was worth it.\"I'm having the time of my life.

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "AGENCY\n",
      "The lion cub, a ball of soft, brown fur with sharp little teeth at only several weeks old, wriggles around in the tourist’s arms as she tries to pose for a cute picture with the animal on a farm not far from the South African capital, Pretoria.Animal rights campaigners from the Humane Society International’s Africa branch (HSI-Africa) have come down strongly against these wildlife selfies, which were a common scene before the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing travel restrictions that killed off tourism.These selfies are just one part of the million-dollar industry that is private lion-breeding on South Africa’s Cape. Thousands of lions are raised in enclosures on private property to later be hunted by big-game hunters from Europe, the United States and other regions.Such a practice is called a “canned lion hunt”. And Environment Minister Barbara Creecy wants to put an end to it in the future, as well as the breeding of lions in captivity. She recently presented extensive recommendations on ways to finally stamp the practice out.As part of her argument, the South African minister, who is not against hunting lions in the wild, raises the ethical question of what shooting a lion bred in captivity in a fenced-in area has to do with a real hunt. “Preventing the hunting of captive lions is in the interests of the authentic wild hunting industry, ” Creecy argues.HSI-Africa wildlife director Audrey Delsink welcomes the move: The South African government has finally adopted “recommendations to end the abhorrent captive-lion breeding industry. Lions will no longer have to suffer in horrid conditions for someone’s selfie, ” she says.Even if they are just recommendations, Delsink sees the move as a huge success for the country’s lions. She estimates that there are nearly 11,000 captive-bred lions on over 260 lion farms nationwide.The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) was also jubilant following the news. In a statement, South African regional director Neil Greenwood calls the practice one of the worst animal welfare abuses of modern times and stresses that it took two decades of lobbying and the deaths of thousands of lions to finally see change.An analysis from HSI looking at trade in mammals included on the CITES endangered species list found that a total of 4,176 lion trophies were exported from South Africa between 2014 and 2018.Within the European Union, Germany is one of the main import countries for such trophies, and after Americans and Spaniards, Germans make up the strongest group of big-game hunters numbers-wise, according to the Pro Wildlife animal protection organisation.Lucrative earningsAccording to private providers, shooting a lion or similar animal in the Cape costs around US$24,000 (RM99,270). A three-week hunting trip can quickly add up to over US$120,000 (RM496,360).South Africa’s lion-breeding industry argues that trophy hunting saves certain species from extinction – an argument similarly made by Botswana or Zimbabwe when they need to justify elephant-hunting.Creecy also considers highly regulated trophy-hunting programmes to be an important part of wildlife conservation, as well as a way for local communities to earn a livelihood. But how much of the money actually reaches the local population is a topic up for debate.Stephan Wunderlich, an expert in hunting abroad for the German Hunting Association (DJV), warns against confusing shooting lions in enclosed areas with sustainable hunting. “It’s a real branch of the industry – comparable to cattle farming – and limited to South Africa, ” he says. Hunting associations have opposed it for years.In countries like Namibia, Botswana or Zimbabwe, free-ranging, individual lions are shot in order to regulate the population, or in cases of animal-human conflict, according to Wunderlich.“This also applies to elephants. In Botswana, for example, a population of at least 135,000 elephants ensures that the animals permanently destroy their own habitat – and that of other species.”But animal rights activists see another another problem: While the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species prohibits the trade of wild lion bones, the bones of captive lions can be exported from South Africa. But since it is almost impossible to distinguish between the body parts of wild and captive lions, they believe this encourages the smuggling of bones from wild lions. – dpa/Ralf E. Krueger\n",

      "What footwear should we all be wearing when we finally get to emerge from our period of Covid-19 social distancing?It seems that, after spending a year lying low – often in slippers – men and women won't be racing back to their high heels or other city-slicking shoe styles as restrictions ease, opting instead for footwear promising style (albeit sometimes questionable) and comfort.As a result, Crocs, sandals and slides are coming back in a big way, poised to accessorise a world of post-pandemic looks.Read more: Think you're stylish, but dress like you did in school? You're just 'cheugy'American e-commerce platform StockX has investigated the trends and looks that are likely to rise in the coming weeks, as well as the boom in online resales of sneakers, streetwear and electronics.As a result, it appears that – despite being considered uncool just a few years ago – certain fashion items have been proving popular since the pandemic.The phenomenon can be put down to this very strange year, spent for a large part in lockdown, wearing gear that was often comfortable, above all.In fact, it's no secret that homewear found many fans during the pandemic, along with jogging pants, sweaters and, more generally, any baggy, comforting styles.As for footwear, sneakers and slippers led the way, relegating stilettos and other city styles to fashion past. And this seems to be continuing as restrictions lift. In fact, there's no radical change in sight.So while summer fashion will no doubt be bold – with a thirst for colour (and glitter) in our lives – there's no way anyone will be \"suffering to look good\". Comfort will still be on the agenda, so it's no surprise to see that sandals and sliders are proving popular with men and women.Crocs are also coming back in a big way. In fact, StockX has seen a 70% increase in the average resale price of these three types of shoe.And that's good news for our feet (but maybe less so for our dignity), which look to have a stress-free summer ahead.Take to the trail!With gyms and clubs closed, outdoor sports and pursuits have also been popular during the pandemic – another trend that looks likely to continue in the coming weeks and months.People (from countries experiencing summer) should be able to make the most of nicer weather to get out for a hike, or head to the mountains.StockX reports that trades of Nike ACG products – the brand's range of all-conditions gear – saw 150% growth in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period a year ago.Read more: Fashion houses look to a different legacy with their anniversary celebrationsA final observation is that resales seem to be riding high, giving rise to a new way of making money. The American platform reports that \"hundreds of thousands of first-time sellers\" started using StockX since lockdowns began in March 2020.In total, products sold by these first-timers between March 2020 and April 2021 had a value of no less than US$800mil (RM3.3bil). – AFP Relaxnews\n",

Please look forward to it\" and then proceeded to respond to questions in the comments.One of the burning questions was regarding an old rumour of her slapping Blackpink's Jennie.This had allegedly happened after Han had broken up with boyfriend Teddy Park, a producer for the K-pop girl group, in 2016. He was later linked with Jennie although her management agency denied the rumours.In Han's comment section, she flatly refuted the rumour, saying: \"I have never met Ms Jennie before.\"The model-turned-actress, best known for her role in K-drama Spy Myung-wol (2011), also addressed her new relationship.In May, Han went public with Ryu Sung-jae, a former stage actor who is 10 years younger than her.Allegations soon surfaced that he used to be a male escort and the scandal did not die down even after she refuted it.When it was brought up again in the comments to her post, Han replied: \"I have a lot of dating experience, but this guy is the real deal.\"She added a heart emoji.In reply to another commenter, she wrote: \"I will protect my man.\"Another rumour swirling around last week was that she had been caught taking drugs at Burning Sun, an infamous night club in Gangnam which had been at the centre of a sex scandal involving K-pop idols in 2019.She had strenuously denied the allegation last week, saying: \"I want more than anything else for the police and the prosecution to shed light on the (rumours) that I am at the centre of this enormous scandal. I cannot reveal everything about my personal life, but all of the points that I've said before, I vouch for them with everything I have.\"In her Instagram comment section, the Burning Sun incident was brought up again and she replied: \"There's beauty in patience. Please wait a little longer.\"Han's new management agency, High Entertainment, which she joined on June 1, said that it would be taking legal action against those spreading rumours. – The Straits Times/Asia News Network\n",

      "PUDING raja or royal pudding gained popularity when the current King’s reign began in 2019.Naturally, it was the dessert served during His Majesty’s installation banquet at Istana Negara.This sweet treat comes from Pahang where it was originally served to the royal family at their palace in Pekan.The recipe was compiled by the Queen herself in her book titled Air Tangan Tengku Puan Pahang.The dish is traditionally served during Malay weddings and festivals as well as during Ramadan.The main ingredient is a small, sweet local banana called pisang lemak manis, but you may substitute it with pisang emas.Unlike many other fried banana recipes where the fruits are sliced first, this calls for the bananas to be fried whole. Be careful when lifting the bananas out of the oil because they get extremely soft and mushy when hot.The most time-consuming component of this dish is the jala emas or golden threads.Although these are available ready-made from many online vendors, you can determine the sweetness level and which egg to make it with if you make them yourself.It is recommended that you use the yolks of duck eggs but chicken egg yolks would work as well.The only difference is the richness in the flavour that you get from duck egg yolks.The other usual garnishes are prunes, crystallised cherries and cashew nuts.Dates can also be added for additional sweetness, as well as walnuts and almonds.This dish is served with a custard sauce, and there are a few variations in the recipe.Some cookbooks call for whole eggs and a bit of water, others just use egg yolks.Although most would simmer the sauce directly in the saucepan, I prefer to whisk it in a double-boiler to make sure I don’t get lumps.When it has thickened, it needs to be refrigerated for about two hours, with a lid on so that the surface does not crust over.If it gets too stiff to pour after being chilled, just whisk in a tablespoon or two of cold water and it should flow when poured.Serve the royal pudding cold with the custard sauce on the side or poured generously over the dessert just before serving.Here’s wishing our Agong a happy birthday, and everyone can enjoy the holiday with a dessert fit for a king.Puding rajaIngredientsJala emas5 yolks from duck eggs1 cup sugar2 cups cold water1 pandan leafCaramelised bananas12 bananas, peeled1 tbsp butter or ghee2 cups cooking oilCustard sauce3 egg yolks3 tbsp sugar1 tin (390ml) evaporated milk1 tsp custard powder1 pandan leafGarnish100g prunes, seeded and halved25g red glacé cherries, halved25g green glacé cherries, halved125g cashew nutsMethodFor the jala emas batter, whisk egg yolks until fluffy, then strain through a wire sieve.Fill batter into a squeeze bottle with a narrow nozzle and set aside, or if you are using a jala mould, fill only when needed.Fill a saucepan with water, sugar and pandan leaf, and bring to a boil. Then remove pandan leaf and bring down the heat to a slow simmer.Drizzle batter into the simmering syrup from a height to get fine strands in a circular motion starting from the outer wall of the saucepan into the centre.Allow the strands to cook for about 30 seconds before lifting them out with a slotted ladle or chopsticks.Repeat four or five times with the remaining batter.For the caramelised bananas, heat cooking oil with butter or ghee.When oil reaches frying temperature, add bananas in whole and fry on all sides until light golden.Drain excess oil on kitchen paper. In the remaining oil, fry the cashew nuts until light golden.For the custard sauce, whisk eggs, milk, sugar and custard powder until combined.Strain through a wire sieve into a bain marie or double boiler, then add pandan leaf and turn the heat on low.Continue whisking until the sauce starts to thicken on a low simmer, then turn off the heat.Strain cooked custard sauce through a wire sieve, cover with a lid and keep in a chiller until needed.To serve, arrange caramelised bananas on the bottom of the dish.Cover bananas with a layer of jala emas, then garnish with fruit and nuts. Serve with custard sauce.\n",

      "From The Archives: Coliseum Cafe, a slice of Malaysian history for 99 years\n",
      "Lifestyle\n",
      "CHESTER CHIN\n",
      "News that the 99-year-old Coliseum Cafe is shutting down for good has caused dismay amongst Malaysian foodies and historians alike. This 2014 story by our Travel writer Chester Chin perfectly encapsulates just why it is such a huge loss to our country's heritage.This story originally appeared in StarLifestyle on 31 August 2014, and has been edited for brevity and clarity.The sconce on the stained wall at the back of Coliseum Café’s dining area hasn’t lit up for a while now. But the lamp’s faulty nature isn’t reason enough to warrant a brand new replacement - not when the item in question is a relic that’s almost a century old.The Western colonial-themed restaurant has been operating since 1921 and in many ways, its dated interior mirrors just that. Antiquated furniture adorns the old mosaic tiled floor, accentuating nostalgia in this quaint venue along the bustling Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman in Kuala Lumpur.At one point during our conversation, the restaurant’s operation manager Jufri Kenneth Abdullah lifts up the tablecloth to reveal the aged wooden surface of the table we are seated at.“For your information, this is 100 years old. This is the same table used back in the restaurant’s early days, ” he reveals, “and so is that coat hanger, ceiling fan and bar top.”He adds that the bar section of the restaurant - once off-limits to the fairer sex - resembles the original arrangements in the 1950s. Framed advertisements from the 1920s and 1930s still hang above the area today.The reason for preserving the café the way it was is history, he says.It’s an incredibly practical logic when you consider that Coliseum Café has weathered many significant milestones in the country.The restaurant stood tall throughout the British colonial rule, the Japanese occupation, Malaya’s independence, the formation of Malaysia and, if you want to put things in a more modern context, the millennium.“In the early days, Coliseum was more of an exclusive dining place. You had to be in proper attire - coat and tie - to dine in. These days, people can just come in shorts and T-shirts, ” Jufri Kenneth says.According to him, the restaurant used to be a favourite haunt among the British colonial crowd when it first opened. By the 1950s, planters and tin miners reportedly gathered on Friday evenings to discuss anti-communist strategies.“Today, we place ourselves as a casual family dining restaurant, ” stresses Jufri Kenneth.Coliseum Café has withstood the test of time. In 2013, the restaurant opened its second outlet at Plaza 33 in Petaling Jaya and was recognised by the Malaysia Book of Records as the “Longest Operating Western Colonial-Themed Restaurant”. They also added a third outlet at Mid Valley Megamall in Kuala Lumpur. In 2014, the venue celebrated its 93rd anniversary in the local culinary scene.Reportedly started by a group of business partners from Hainan Island in China, the restaurant has seen its fair share of famous diners, including the first Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman.Acclaimed cartoonist Datuk Mohammad Nor Khalid, endearingly known as Lat, even left behind caricatures of customers who have dined at the venue.Of course, the food is a big part of the draw.“What you see here are all retained from the past, ” Jufri Kenneth says of the menu.The perennial favourites, he says, are the baked crabmeat, homemade oxtail soup, Hainanese fried noodles and “anything that has to do with sizzling”. Of course, one can’t possibly disregard the Hainanese chicken chop - an aspect that’s as ubiquitous as the old Hainanese cooks who prepared them in the past.Although it primarily catered to the British when it first opened, Jufri Kenneth is an ardent believer in Coliseum Café being a thoroughly Malaysian restaurant today.“The Hainanese brought their own style of cooking, the Indians brought the spices and some Malay cooking influences make the food served here Malaysian cuisine.“Dining at Coliseum is actually a walk down memory lane. My father used to bring me here when I was a boy. Back then, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman was known as Batu Road and it was a two-way street.After a brief pause, he adds: “I bring my kids here and eventually, I’m sure they will bring theirs too.”\n",

      "Well, here we are, stuck at home again. I guess it’s back to making drinks at home again, huh?Well, since we’ve already covered what sorts of spirits, liqueurs, and syrups you should have in your home bar, let us now talk about the sort of tools you need to recreate your favourite cocktails at home.Now, before we get into the sorts of bar tools that are out there, it should be pointed out that you don’t HAVE to get these tools for your home, as there are plenty of utensils in your kitchen that can be used for the same purpose. For instance, a cookie jar can be used as a cocktail shaker, baking measuring spoons can replace jiggers, a chopstick can stir a drink just as well as a fancy bar spoon... well, you get the picture.However, while these replacements will get your drink made, they don’t offer the same experience as using some proper bar tools.ADVERTISING“We feel that having the right tools will give you more joy and better results in what you are making, ” says Nathan Pinto, co-founder of The 4 Barmen, a Malaysian startup that specialises in making good quality and affordable bar tools.“Sure, you can mix cocktails using a water jug at home, however, with a proper cocktail shaker, you have better control when mixing and shaking drinks with finesse.“Working with ‘make-do’ tools will get the job done, but using proper tools, the whole experience will be exceptionally better and becomes more fun. The results also taste and look better, ” Pinto adds.The 4 Barmen was formed when the four founders – who are cocktail enthusiasts, but not professional bartenders – realised that the options for bar tools in the Malaysian market were limited. Hence, they decided to take matters into their own hands and set up a store offering high quality bar tools and glassware at a reasonable price, with more elegant finishes, in order to inspire Malaysians to create more cocktails at home. Their store includes three levels of Starter kits suitable for home bartenders, depending on the skill level of the user.With that in mind, let’s learn about the different sorts of bartools and what they are used for, with some help from bartender Shawn Chong of the Mizukami Collective and Bar Class Academy Asia.ShakerThe primary function of a shaker is to mix, chill, aerate, and dilute a cocktail. There are two main types of shakers that are commonly used in bars – the Cobbler and the Boston.The main difference between the two is obviously the shape and size. Also known as a three-piece shaker, the Cobbler is the one that looks like a little metal bottle, while the larger Boston shaker is commonly made up of two large vessels, usually made of metal, though some are a combination of metal and glass vessels.“A Cobbler shaker generally fits one or two drinks depending on volume, while a Boston can accommodate three to four, ” Chong says.“The Boston shaker is also more efficient in making drinks that have solid items like fruit, herbs and spices as well as well drinks that call for cream or dairy. The space in the shaker eases the frothing capability.”According to him, the Boston shaker is also more versatile as open vessels are easier and faster to clean, so a Boston Shaker wins on hygiene.The cobbler shaker, on the other hand, has an in-built strainer at the top and so is favourable for cocktails that don't call for any fresh herbs, purees or pulp.JiggerWith a distinctive hourglass shape, the jigger is a bartenders' measuring tool.“Just like baking, accuracy is required to create balanced cocktails by respecting the proportions a recipe calls for. It's far faster and more efficient than using a scale, though a scale would win at point accuracy, ” says Chong.Mixing GlassA mixing glass is used to stir a cocktail rather than shake it, as this allows you to maintain better control over the amount of dilution, and also maintain the texture and viscosity of the drink better.Sure, you can just use a normal glass or a jar to mix drinks, but many bartenders tend to use specially crafted mixing glasses. This is not just for the aesthetics – some professional mixing glasses, like the Yarai mixing glass (named after the Japanese diamond pattern etched on the outside) are made with a heavy base, uses thicker glass, has a spout at the top for easy pouring, and the pattern at the side makes it easier to hold while using.Bar spoonA spoon is just a spoon, right? Well, not when it’s a bar spoon. “While its primary function is for stirring cocktails, It can also be used to measure smaller quantities instead of using a jigger, as a bar spoon usually measures three to four millilitres of liquid, ” says Chong.A bar spoon can also be used for layering spirits on top of one another, either by pouring the spirit over the underside of the spoon, or by using the spiral stem.Some bar spoons also either come with a fork on the other end (which can be used for skewering garnishes or squeezing citrus directly from fruit wedges), or a muddler. Which brings us to...MuddlerThe muddler is used to crush fruits, herbs or spices to extract its flavour properties. The size of the muddler doesn't matter, though a larger one usually requires less effort.StrainerBartenders commonly use two types of strainers – Hawthorne strainers and conventional mesh strainers.A Hawthorne strainer is usually paired with a Boston shaker to hold muddled items and ice, as the ice shouldn't be reused once a drink is made. It commonly comes with prongs that sit at the lip of the shaker.\"A Hawthorne Strainer with no prongs serves the same purpose but is very useful for bartenders to use the ‘throw’ technique,\" says Chong. \"The throw technique allows for a slower dilution rate than shaking and more aeration than stirring yielding a different end result to a cocktail.\"According to Chong, most of the time, a normal mesh strainer would be sufficient for straining your drinks, but there are times when you need to ‘fine strain’ it as well.Fine straining means using both a Hawthorne Strainer AND a mesh strainer together in order to effectively remove any smaller particles that a Hawthorne can't hold back. It is also used to ensure a nice smooth froth/foam should the cocktail need it.Bar bladeA bar blade is a bottle opener that's meant for high volume bars where bottled drinks like beer are served a lot, according to Chong.“Its length usually causes the blade protrude from a bartender's pocket for easy access and with a long blade it creates a better fulcrum making it easier to open the caps. The long blade also allows bartenders to do tricks/flair in hopes to earn some tips!” he says.Michael Cheang used to shake cocktails using a plastic cookie jar. Now he has a proper shaker and is not afraid to use it. Follow him on Facebook (fb.com/mytipsyturvy), Instagram (@MyTipsyTurvy) or Twitter (@MichaelCheang).\n",

      "IAN LAU - RETRO RECIPE\n",
      "LAKSA is a dish that has a different meaning depending on where you come from.Although by definition laksa is a spicy noodle soup, various states in Malaysia have their own spin on this dish, each offering a different culinary experience.Sarawak laksa became world famous when the late Anthony Bourdain claimed that this “breakfast of the gods” is “one of the foods served in heaven” and featured it twice in his shows --- for Travel Channel’s No Reservations and CNN’s Parts Unknown.I discovered when preparing it that Sarawak’s laksa is distinctive not so much for the combination of herbs and spices in the broth.The biggest difference is how it is thickened not just with coconut milk but with roasted ground sesame seeds and peanuts.This recipe, one of the simpler made-from-scratch Sarawak laksa recipes, was previously published in Flavours magazine, and is stored in the Kuali.com archives.However, even many true-blood Sarawakians are opting for ready-made spice paste because of the many components required before cooking the dish.Do not be intimidated by the number of ingredients though.Some of the roasting and toasting of ingredients can be done ahead of time, and even the broth can be prepared a day before if coconut milk is added just before serving.While laksa from other states are served with either laksa noodles (Penang, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang), wheat noodles with or without rice vermicelli (Perak, Selangor and Melaka), or spaghetti (Johor), Sarawak laksa uses only rice vermicelli.A Sarawak laksa stall at a Chinese coffeeshop in Petaling Jaya uses Sarawak mee kolo noodles and I learned from my colleague Tina Loh from Kuching that this is not the norm.She advised that laksa in Kuching is only served with chicken.Combined with prawns, these two meats provide proteins to enrich the broth and garnish the dish.Some recipes also include sliced fish cake as a topping, which you may add if desired.One topping missing from this recipe, though, is julienne omelette.Loh says the egg is a crucial ingredient and remembers from having helped her mum cook the dish at home.I decided to include it too.Although Loh also insisted on belacan in the sambal condiment, this recipe listed only dried shrimps.I felt that it was essentially the same basic ingredient but in different form, as everyone was wowed by its taste despite the absence of belacan.You may add belacan if you wish.I know that although it may not be viewed as authentic by many Sarawakians, I hope this recipe makes a good tribute to their state dish.

Set aside.To make the spice paste, blend all the ingredients with a little oil into a fine paste.Heat the oil in a frying pan and saute the spice paste until fragrant, then add sesame seeds, peanuts, curry powder and seasonings.To make the laksa broth, place the spice paste in a large saucepan and add stock and coconut milk. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat, adding more stock if necessary, to adjust its consistency.To serve, divide the vermicelli among bowls and ladle the broth over it, then garnish and serve piping hot with sambal.\n",

      "VEGETARIAN goose got its name not because it tastes like goose meat but because of its crispy texture that resembles the skin of roast goose.It is made completely out of foo pei, or bean curd skin, and is seasoned with a mixture of red fermented bean curd and five spice powder.It is said to have been invented by Buddhist monks in Hangzhou, China, and is one of the first vegetarian dishes that, although having a meat moniker, doesn’t really mimic the real thing – unlike many other mock meats.It is not often prepared at home because not many people like to deep-fry, so it is usually bought ready-made.However, it is not really difficult to make because it only contains a few ingredients, and the oil can be reused for other dishes.The most important step is to keep your packages neat without the raw edges of the bean curd skin breaking into the oil.This is done by folding the edges of the bean curd skin towards the centre until you get a package that has all the raw edges tucked into a narrow rectangle.Then secure the packages with toothpicks so they do not open up when frying.Some recipes give instructions to poke holes into the packages before frying to release the air bubbles.I find this method allows too much oil to penetrate into the folds of the packages, making it crispy all the way inside but very greasy.I prefer to puncture the bubbles as they emerge so that it’s less greasy and still soft inside.Unless you can multitask, I recommend frying the packages one at a time so that the oil temperature doesn’t lower too much and it is easier to handle any erupting bubbles.The vegetarian goose should be consumed immediately although it can stay crispy for a few hours.If left out for too long, it can be made crispy again in a toaster oven at 150°C for 10 minutes, but it should not be fried again.You may serve it as an appetiser with a sweet Thai chilli sauce.Vegetarian gooseIngredients3 sheets bean curd skin3 cups cooking oilsweet chilli sauceMarinade3 cubes red fermented beancurd150ml cold water1½ tsp icing sugar½ tsp light soy sauce½ tsp five spice powderMethodIn a small bowl, break up bean curd cubes with a little water before adding in the remaining water. Add sugar, soy sauce and five spice powder and whisk together until combined.Spread open the bean curd skins and arrange on a countertop.Stack them neatly one on top of the other and cut into quarters with kitchen shears.Take one quarter sheet of bean curd skin and brush the marinade seasoning all over the surface.Place another sheet on top and brush lightly with a layer of marinade.Fold the long ends of the bean curd sheet to meet in the centre, then fold in the sides, making sure that the raw edges are tucked into the inside of the bean curd package.Use toothpicks to secure both ends and one in the centre to hold the piece in place. Then continue to brush and fold remaining sheets until you get six bean curd packages.The final packages should measure about 7x20cm, each consisting of about 16 layers of bean curd skin.Heat oil in a frying pan and deep-fry packages one at a time until golden brown.Use a bamboo skewer to puncture the packages as you fry so that the bubbles do not suddenly burst and splatter oil all over the place.Remove toothpicks after frying, cut into slices and serve immediately with sweet chilli sauce.\n",

      "Steak, rare? Why not, as long as it's grown in-vitro. That's the conclusion of a study published last week regarding attitudes to consuming meat grown in a laboratory.Conducted collaboratively by two American universities and one British, the study, available in the Foods journal, aims to understand the state of mind of different generations facing the emergence of alternative meat production. These in-vitro proteins are made from animal cells and then grown in test tubes. This type of cultivation presents an alternative to traditional breeding whose consequences on the environment are disastrous.The younger the generation, the more in favour of in-vitro meatTo find out more about perceptions of what not long ago seemed like a meal out of a work of science fiction, the researchers interviewed adults of different age groups.The study was conducted on representative samples of the American and British populations. And appetites vary depending on the generation. About 89% of GenZers are inclined to consume it and have a positive view of the subject. A similar percentage is found among millennials (85%).Boomers, on the other hand, are less open, with just 77% \"at least somewhat open\" to trying lab-raised meat.In vitro meat vs farmed meatOn average, those who took part in the study said that this new type of protein could make up 37-42% of their diet's meat in the future.Generally, answers suggested that many expected farmed meat to remain on their plates and that this new form of protein would make up a \"partial, rather than full, replacement for meat\".In their study, the researchers found that \"despite growing evidence of the environmental and public health threats posed by today's intensive animal production, consumers in the west remain largely attached to meat.\"It is therefore difficult to predict whether this type of meat will become widespread. It will be necessary above all to convince a public that has been fed on farmed meat, although it may become easier as younger generations become purchasers for their households. – AFP Relaxnews\n",

      "Climate change is threatening our tea consumption. A recent report shows that extreme weather conditions are likely to alter the taste of the world's most widely consumed beverage. By 2050, a quarter of the tea plants in India and Kenya could have disappeared.Wine, rice, chocolate, coffee, etc. The list of foods threatened by global warming is long. And now we can add tea to it. Floods, heat waves, hurricanes... these meteorological events are becoming increasingly frequent due to climate change and threatening tea growing areas in the world.This is particularly the case in Kenya, the world's largest exporter of black tea. In this African country, the number of tea plants could decrease considerably in the coming decades, and even dwindle by a quarter by 2050, according to a new report by British charity Christian Aid.But the effects of the climate crisis could be felt long in another way before a possible tea shortage. Like some wines, the taste of tea could be altered and have less flavor than the tea we're used to drinking. Indeed, flooding and increased rainfall could alter the subtle flavors of the tea leaf and potentially reduce its health benefits, the report says.\"\"[W]hen tea plants get really wet they suffer a double whammy because the plants stop having the ecological cues to make these metabolites and the few that are there get diluted as the plant gets waterlogged,\" explain the study authors.A threat that also threatens other major tea-producing regions, including China, India and Sri Lanka. To prevent these adverse effects on tea, which remains the most consumed beverage in the world, the report suggests several courses of action, including strengthening international policies dedicated to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing climate financing to help countries and farmers adapt to climate change.The charity also stresses the need to cancel the debt of poor countries (already heavily burdened by the pandemic), in order to give them \"the fiscal space to better respond to the impacts of climate change. These recommendations are made in view of the COP26, which will be held in November in the city of Glasgow, Scotland. – AFP RelaxnewsQuench your thirst with tasty beverages.

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "SUZANNE LAZAROO\n",
      "A 'laksa war' has broken out amongst Malaysian netizens recently. But what are the different types of laksa in Malaysia? Here is a story from our archives where we explored the different interpretations in each state and region.This story originally appeared on StarLifestyle in two parts on 27 August and 3 September 2017, and has been edited for brevity and clarity.Flavour-drenched, hit-the-spot comfort food, a rush of spices or a hit of bracing tang, made with wheat noodles, rice noodles or even al dente spaghetti – laksa has many faces, and they’re all delicious.At its heart, it’s a dish of noodles in a spiced gravy, which can have a creamy coconut milk base or a sour asam base. A bowlful then brims with fish flakes, prawns, chicken and even blood cockles or roast pork, and shredded cucumber, pineapple, bean sprouts and herbs... and often, a spoonful of fiery sambal or pungent prawn paste, making the dish further customisable to each diner.In Malaysia, the different incarnations of laksa are bound by more than just a loose structure and character, of noodles in gravy – daun kesum is also called laksa leaf, because it’s used so extensively in the various versions of the dish. Most laksas are perfumed by it, along with other herbs and spices.Sound simple? It’s not. Here, almost every state has its own version of laksa, and broad interpretations of the one dish can also span hazy regional borders – such as laksam which is a white-on-white dish of thick, rustic rice noodle rolls in a pale, rich gravy of coconut milk and fish (or more rarely, eel), popular in the northern states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Kedah.ADVERTISING“When you look at the styles in Peninsular Malaysia especially, it feels like there is a natural geographical progression from north to south, from the more sour, thin gravies to the creamy, rich ones, ” said celebrity chef Isadora Chai.“Malaysians are very familiar with and possessive of their own regional or state laksas – I think there’s an emotional connection for a lot of people, who have been eating a particular laksa all their lives, ” she said.You also find laksa in Thailand, where it’s called khanom jeen, made with rice noodles and also manifesting in various incarnations, and in Indonesia, where permutations of the dish are specific to towns and cities. In Singapore, the coconut milk-based Katong laksa is extremely popular, traceable to the Straits Chinese community based in the Katong precinct.There are various origin theories for laksa – in different countries, usually traceable to interactions between Chinese traders or settlers, who brought their own thin noodle soups with them, and locals, who then decked out those broths with local herbs and spices, and coconut milk.While it’s difficult to pinpoint its specific origins in Malaysia, in states like Melaka and Penang especially – both enclaves of the Peranakan community – the dish seems to have been born among the ranks of the Peranakans, the descendants of Chinese traders marrying local Malays.What is evident though, as you contemplate such a lush bowl of plenty, is that it is a fusion of sorts, in the best sense of the word – cultures, states and regions contributing various elements to come up with an extremely delicious whole.Currying flavourCurry laksa is thick and rich, with just a hint of sweetness from the addition of thick coconut milk.Possibly the best examples are the ones you find in the Klang Valley and Melaka, which are usually garnished with tofu pok (bean curd puffs), chicken, fish cake slices, prawns, blood cockles and long beans. The finishing touch? That spoonful of sambal and a scattering of mint.\"Melaka laksa is quite straightforward to cook, because there’s no fish involved, you don’t have to flake the fish flesh, so it’s the fastest to cook, ” said recipe developer and cookbook author Debbie Teoh.In Penang, where curry laksa is also known as curry mee, there are two variants of the dish using yellow Hokkien noodles – one served doused in chicken curry the colour of a fiery sunrise, the other in a pale, thin coconut milk base (this has now come to be known as white curry mee).Aromatic chilli paste is then added according to one’s taste. In white curry mee, the Chinese side of laksa’s identity is manifested strongly – via cubes of congealed pork blood!“Curry mee is what I’d choose if I wanted something creamy yet light, ” said Teoh.Asam-based laksasThe thin, sour laksas spiked with asam are usually made with asam gelugor, dried slices of the Garcinia atroviridis fruit, with its slightly astringent, clean sour hit that makes your lips pucker, as opposed to the sweet-sour pulp of asam jawa or tamarind (Tamarindus indica). Some laksas use a combination of the two and in a pinch, you can sub one for the other – only the very discerning will notice the rounder, fuller mouthfeel of tamarind.Sour, spicy and laden with the intensely fishy appeal of flaked mackerel, then perked up with turmeric and freshened with pineapple, chilli, mint, laksa leaves and bunga kantan (torch ginger flower), Penang’s asam laksa is deservedly famous – and it’s still not asam laksa until a spoonful of pungent hae kor (fermented prawn paste) is stirred into the heady mix.“Ikan parang is the best fish to use – it’s sweet, with a melt-in-the-mouth texture – but it’s also the most work to get the flesh off the many small bones, ” said Teoh.In July 2011, CNN Travel ranked the dish at No. 7 for deliciousness, in a list of 50 foods in the world (later that year, a public poll saw it fall to the 26th rung though).Perlis and Kedah laksas are similar, but the former is often made with catfish or eel, while the latter sees hard-boiled egg slices added, as well as various ulam. Malay sellers tend to serve it with a spoonful of sambal nyiur, or coconut sambal.In this way, laksa also illustrates the differences in area, highlighting the produce farmed or produced in a state – such as the use of freshwater eels, fresh rice noodles in the rice-rich northern states, or the fact that Johor doesn’t really grow rice much – as well as cultural influences from the ethnic communities in an area.Hybrid offeringsAnd then there are laksas that defy convention like the laksa Siam found in Penang and Kedah that is a further fusion of both asam and curry laksa!This rich laksa is sour and fishy like asam laksa, and rich with spices and coconut cream at the same time – what you would call the best of both worlds.In Johor, the creamy laksa gravy – enriched with asam gelugor as well as lemongrass, galangal and dried prawns – is characteristically served with spaghetti, making its fusion roots stretch further beyond borders than most.According to Kalsom Taib and Hamidah Abdul Hamid in Johor Palate: Tanjung Puteri Recipes, Johor’s well-travelled Sultan Abu Bakar (who ruled the state from 1886 to 1895) loved pasta from his first visit to Italy; he instructed his chefs to switch out the traditional noodles for the pasta, and Johor laksa was born.Heading EastOn Malaysia’s East Coast, a tale of two laksas is told.Skirting the coasts of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang – and finding their way to Johor on occasion – these are the Rose Red and Snow White of a very different (and delicious) fairy tale.Siblings, they are laced with the fish and coconut milk that you would expect from their lands of origin, but manifest quite differently.The kuah putih, or white gravy, sees its noodles in a simpler, cleaner, milder gravy. It’s particularly popular in Kelantan, where it’s synonymous with the eponymous Laksa Kelantan.In the state, its purity of colour is maintained by the common use of tenggiri, with its marble-pale flesh, in homes. If you buy it from a street vendor though, you’re likely to find the cheaper ikan kembung instead.Laksa kuah putih gives the humble white pepper a dominant role in a way that few dishes do – it’s the predominant flavour in the thick coconut milk gravy, with a supporting cast of shallots, ginger and lemongrass. A squeeze of lime freshens the gravy after its slow cooking treatment.It’s a gravy that is similar to the one that bathes laksam; what differentiates them is the thick, rustic rice rolls that you’ll find in laksam.Both dishes are finished with a generous handful of vegetables and fragrant herbs – finely-sliced long beans, bean sprouts, cucumber, with Thai (daun selasih) or holy (daun kemangi) basil and the ubiquitous laksa leaf (daun kesum).“Terengganu is the only state where both laksa kuah putih and kuah merah – which we also call ‘kuah masak’ – are offered alongside for choice in the markets, ” To’ Puan Rosita Abdullah, author of Kayu Manis: A Tribute to Terengganu told Flavours magazine in a 2012 article.“The Terengganu kuah masak uses less fish, unlike in Pahang, where the gravy is thicker. The laksa paste can easily be bought in the market and fish used could be tenggiri, kembung or selayang.“The fresh green topping can include shredded brinjal and daun jambu golok (cashew nut shoots).”Because of its comparative mildness, you’ll find laksa kuah putih eaten for breakfast more often.Also based on coconut milk, kuah merah has extra fish power – in addition to the fresh ikan kembung or tenggiri it’s usually made with, the deeper, more layered flavour of salted fish is also often discernible.In addition to the other toppings, the intensely orange-yolked salted duck egg can also be a topping, as can daun kaduk (wild pepper leaf).“People usually make one or the other, ” said Datin Munira Salinger, in Red & White Laksas (Flavours, 2012).In the Pahang-born former teacher’s autobiography, My Story, you’ll find illustrations of her long-held enthusiasm for researching the history and culture of Malay food in particular, with some of her favourite recipes.She says that the kuah merah is a grander dish with more planning and prep involved, and so usually saved for more elaborate functions, rather than one-dish meals at home.“It is something that one gives to family members living nearby – often sent in a tiffin carrier as a gift, and one would provide enough to feed the whole family, ” she said.Sarawakian sensationHopping across the South China Sea, you’ll find Sarawak Laksa – a dish so fabulously rich that it sees foodies’ ears pricking up all over the country at the mere mention.While its home state boasts the most proliferation, you’ll also find it in Sabah, and in neighbouring Brunei.The fact that Sarawak laksa is made from a paste with a multitude of ingredients that also remains a jealously-guarded secret only adds to its mystery-wreathed allure.Often, when you find the dish on a menu in Peninsular Malaysia, it’s been made with the paste specially-ordered from Sarawak; a few adventurous chefs do attempt to replicate it solely by taste, but Sarawak laksa is unique in its common status as being more often made from a paste made and imported from its home state. This is so even when the dish is cooked at home.The fiery, crimson gravy is laced with spices like cumin, star anise, fennel, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, white pepper and coriander, and includes a chunk of belacan along with the ginger, chillies, lemongrass, galangal and shallots. Both chicken and prawn stocks are used, and there are also roasted, ground peanuts, sesame seeds and candlenuts in there.That explains its distinctive, delicious complexity and richness, but the key is in getting the ratio of every ingredient right.Its origins, like those of many local dishes, are anchored more in lore than stone.There’s a legend that in 1945, Goh Lik Teck, a Teochew migrant from Guangzhou, China, started selling a simpler version of the dish – with just six ingredients – in Kuching’s Carpenter Street.Another story has the laksa emerging from the Chinese and Malay cultural collusion, rather than just one noodle-seller.In the 1960s, Goh’s family started making and selling the paste to other vendors; around the same time, businessman Tan Yong Him started selling the paste commercially under the Swallow brand, and other bird-oriented brands soon followed suit.Laksa paste and intense gravy aside, the other building blocks of Sarawak laksa are rice vermicelli, shreds of chicken and omelette, prawns and fresh coriander leaves. A spoonful of piquant sambal and lime halves are always served on the side.And that’s the dish that Anthony Bourdain tweeted was the “breakfast of the gods” in 2015, when he revisited Kuching’s famous Choon Hui Cafe for CNN’s Parts Unknown; it was his second visit to the very same coffee shop, after his 2005 stop there for the Travel Channel’s No Reservations.Order popular Malaysian cuisine at discounted prices by using foodpanda Voucher\n",

      "Just over a decade ago, American plant-based meat producers like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods seemed like the archetypal outliers dreaming of big things that no one had ever heard about, much less thought was possible.The two were the earliest producers of plant-based meats and launched their products in an era fraught with skepticism and disbelief.Fast forward a decade later and both brands are behemoths in the plant-based alternative protein space which has become both crowded and lucrative.Global growth has been so positive that a recent report by Boston Consulting Group and Blue Horizon Corporation indicates that although alternative proteins accounted for 2% of the world protein market in 2020, this figure is likely to go up to 11% by 2035.This means that in under 20 years, nearly 1/10th of the protein consumed around the world will potentially take the form of an alternative protein.What is plant-based meat?‘Alternative protein’ is an umbrella term used to describe protein-rich products sourced from plants, insects, fungi or through muscle tissue grown in labs with cells harvested from real animals (cell-cultured meat).Of these available options, plant-based meat has been the most visible and successful since first hitting mainstream consciousness 10 years ago with the introduction of Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat’s realistic burger patties.Since then, the plant-based meat market has gained the bulk of investments – USD2.1bil (RM8.6 bil) in investments in 2020 (paired together with plant-based egg and dairy) compared to USD360mil (RM1.4bil) for cultivated meat and USD590mil (RM2.4bil) for fermentation companies, according to data released by The Good Food Institute Asia Pacific (GFI APAC), a non-profit organisation that aims to expedite growth of the alternative protein sector.This is buoyed by an increasingly global consumer base, introduced to these products via a growing number of fast-food chains, supermarkets and restaurants around the world.So what are plant-based meats? Plant-based meats, also known as meat analogues are essentially plant-derived products designed to closely resemble the physical appearance, taste, texture and structure of their original protein counterpart, whether that’s chicken, beef, lamb or other animal products.Plant-based meat primarily takes two forms – whole muscle meat and restructured meat. Whole muscle meat is meant to mimic whole animal muscle structures like chicken breasts and steaks while restructured meat (which seems to be more prevalent in the plant-based space) is essentially plant-based replicas of products like nuggets, meat strips, minced meat, burger patties, sausages and luncheon meat, to name a few.The products are usually fashioned out of a range of ingredients that can include grains and legumes including soy, wheat, rice, peas, chickpeas, lentils and mung beans which are converted into flours, isolates and concentrates. Flavours, colour components, minerals, carbohydrates and fats like coconut oil and canola oil are often also included in the overall formulation.The Beyond Meat burger patty for instance, features pea protein isolate as a hero ingredient alongside mung beans, brown rice, coconut oil and cocoa butter while Impossible Foods contain potato, soy, coconut oil and flavour from a molecule called heme.To concoct a believable product both in terms of taste and texture, plant-based meats typically go through either one of two processes – dry extrusion or wet extrusion, which basically enables plant proteins to combine with other ingredients to form a successful formulation while eliminating unwanted flavours, aromas and textures.“Ultimately, the choice of creating plant-based alternatives using dry or wet processes is a market decision. High-moisture products can provide better texture options such as meat-like fibres but will also require cold chains to be distributed. Dry products can travel, be stored more easily, and later be rehydrated, making it often more suitable for business-to-business distribution. Supply chains will decide which ones fit their needs best, ” says Adrien Beauvisage, head of region for South-East Asia and Oceania for Bühler, a Swiss multinational company which specialises in food technology.The corporation – alongside Swiss food flavour mavens Givaudan, recently set up Singapore’s ground-breaking Protein Innovation Centre.The Asian plant-based meat marketWhile the initial success of plant-based meats was centred in America and Europe, plant-based proteins have very quickly established a firm footing in the Asia Pacific region, an acceleration that has been fuelled in part by the Covid-19 global pandemic, which has driven changes in consumer perception, awareness and general enthusiasm for plant-based meats.This increased acceptance of plant-based meats was at first generated by a fear of eating animal products spurred by reports that the Covid-19 virus might have originated from the consumption of wild animals in a market in Wuhan, China.But on a larger scale the pandemic has caused a seismic shift in thinking, with many Asians now more informed and interested in issues like sustainability and health. This interest has also been enhanced by increased availability of plant-based meats and improvements in the taste and texture of these proteins.“There is compelling evidence that the global pandemic further accelerated a shift towards alternative proteins that was already gaining steam across Asia Pacific. During the first two months after the coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong-based plant-based meat company Green Monday reported that online sales more than doubled.“Similar surges were documented in Korea and other major Asian markets, which helps explain why investment in Asia Pacific-based alternative protein companies was 600% higher in 2020 than 2019, ” says Mirte Gosker, the acting managing director of GFI APAC.Research published by nutrition company Herbalife Nutrition in December 2020 backs these claims up. The study polled 8,000 people in the Asia Pacific region and found that 41% of respondents, especially in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines now display a greater openness to plant-based food options.Meanwhile, another study conducted by DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences found that 78% of Asians now believe plant-based meats are here to stay.This turn of events is interesting, because plant-based meats are not actually new in some parts of Asia, like China. In fact, old-school soy based mock meat and plant-based meat replacements like tofu and tempeh have been around for eons. The difference is, these products catered to niche, often domestic markets and never really gained an international audience.The 2.0 versions of plant-based meats on the other hand, seemed to have reeled in not only vegan and vegetarian fans but also meat-eaters who want to make meaningful changes to their diets, in line with the growing flexitarian and reducetarian global movements.According to plant-based egg producer Eat Just’s founder Josh Tetrick, “The demographics for Just Egg in South-East Asia are similar to those who enjoy the product in the United States and elsewhere in the world.“They’re 21-50-year-olds who care about eating a little bit better when they’re at home or on the go and realise their food choices not only make them healthier but contribute positively to the world around them. When the choice is delicious, convenient and accessible, switching to plant-based is easy.”While broadening the mass market appeal of new-fangled plant-based meats will be pivotal in expanding its reach in Asia, in many ways, many countries in the region already have an advantage, having been exposed to conventional plant-based meat replacements for ages now. It is this familiarity with plant-based meat substitutes that is likely to accelerate the movement in Asia a lot quicker than many other regions around the world.In fact, Zion Market Research’s 2020 report indicated that by 2025 (a mere four years away), the Asia Pacific region will hold the largest share of the global plant-based market due to familiarity with soy-based vegan proteins as well as growing environmental consciousness.“The demand and familiarity with meat alternatives already exists in Asia, which allows a new generation of meat alternatives, with better taste and nutrition profile, to grow even faster, ” affirms Beauvisage.Supply channelsThe increase in demand for plant-based meats among Asia Pacific consumers aligns with the growing number of start-ups and legacy brands developing their own range of plant-based meats.In Thailand for instance, plant-based meat firm Let’s Plant Meat put together its plant-based patty fashioned out of soy in just 12 months, and now sells it in Thailand for half the price of Beyond Meat.Other success stories include Malaysian-based Phuture Daging, which sells minced meat made out of soy, rice, peas and chickpea protein that is available in Singapore and Malaysia; Hong Kong start-up OmniMeat, which makes meat strips, mince and luncheon meat crafted out of shiitake mushrooms, pea, soy and rice and has a presence in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia; and South Korean brand Unlimeat’s plant-based beef, made from surplus grains that would otherwise be discarded. Unlimeat has successfully penetrated a few key markets like Hong Kong and even the United States.Conventional legacy brands like Nestle have also stepped up their game in Asia. Nestle’s Harvest Gourmet plant-based meat range in South-East Asia is processed in a new purpose-designed plant-based facility in Shah Alam, Selangor – the multinational giant’s first plant-focused space in the region.But perhaps nowhere has the growth and interest in plant-based proteins been more viscerally seen and felt than in Singapore, which has dashed ahead in the alternative protein game. The Singapore government has a $100bil (RM309 bil) plan to prepare for the effects of the climate crisis, and tangential to that is the goal of producing 30% of its own nutritional needs by 2030 (Singapore currently imports about 90% of its food).To facilitate this, the government has encouraged and nurtured a reputation as a food tech capital, which in turn has facilitated its rise to becoming the regional (and potentially global) epicentre of alternative proteins.This has translated into a slew of homegrown Singapore start-ups venturing into this lucrative field from Next Gen Food’s Tindle brand of plant-based chicken to Karana’s whole-plant jackfruit replacement meats.The country has also attracted numerous international brands and organisations looking to make their mark in Asia, with Singapore as their home turf.Innovative plant-based egg producer Eat Just for example, is building its first and largest plant protein production facility in Singapore and in December 2020, the company became the first in the world to get regulatory approval to sell lab-grown meat to Singaporean consumers.More recently, in April 2021, Swiss brands Buhler and Givaudan which respectively specialise in technology and food flavours, combined forces to launch the Protein Innovation Centre (PIC) – the first of its kind in Asia to accelerate plant-based foods.The centre is a one-stop space with all the equipment required to produce and test new products and the expertise to expedite product development. This technology and expertise is open to start-ups, researchers and manufacturers in Asia interested in producing plant-based alternatives and scaling production, ultimately allowing new players to make faster and more successful market entries.“By 2050, the global population will reach nearly 10 billion people and global food demand will soar by more than 50%. This will happen in challenging circumstances due the increasing impact of climate change. Finding all the protein needed to feed this ever-growing population will be a challenge, including in Asia, where roughly half of the world’s population is located.“A change in our protein diet – relying less on animal protein and more on plant-based protein – is seen as one of the most potent ways we can achieve food security. It would free up large amounts of arable land and water for human consumption.“To make it happen, it’s important that large population centres get access to plant-based products and consume larger numbers of plant-based proteins, including meat substitutes. Singapore, placed at the centre of South-East Asia and known for its cuisine derived from several ethnic groups, is a strategic location to make sure that new products developed in Asia find their audience, ” says Beauvisage.\n",

      "Get your copy of Sunday Star tomorrow, May 16,2021, for a 25% discount on two of the cookbooks featured here. Look for the coupon in StarLifestyle, page 4.Real Vietnamese Cooking: Everyday Favourites from the Street to the KitchenAuthors: Yumiko Adachi, Shinobu Ito & Masumi SuzukiPublisher: Tuttle PublishingPrice: RM69.29 (not available until June)This fascinating cookbook is written by three intrepid Japanese food explorers who have spent a considerable amount of time cooking and researching Vietnamese food and training with Vietnam’s best chefs to unlock the secrets to the cuisine.The three are such fans of the cuisine that co-authors Yumiko Adachi and Masumi Suzuki even have their own Vietnamese restaurants in Japan while Shinobu Ito has waxed lyrical about her love for the cuisine on many television shows.In this cookbook, you’ll discover a whole host of interesting information about Vietnamese cuisine, from the history of pho (which dates back 100 years) to the banh mi sandwich and the fact that the country is made up of 54 ethnic groups that have all contributed to the cuisine’s evolution.Recipes in the book include crispy stuffed rice paper snacks, chicken pho, lemongrass beef banh mi and steamed rice cakes with shrimp flakes, among a rich variety of traditional dishes.The great thing about this book is that aside from teaching eager neophytes how to make fascinating new Vietnamese dishes, it also imparts useful information about the origins of these meals, ensuring that readers get a two-in-one history and cooking lesson with each recipe.So if you’ve been hankering for the food of our neighbouring country, this handy cookbook offers everything you’ll need to get acquainted with Vietnamese cooking.The Pepper Thai CookbookAuthor: Pepper Teigen with Garrett SnyderPublisher: Clarkson PotterPrice: RM158.85If you’ve ever taken a peek at American supermodel and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen’s Instagram account, chances are very, very high that you would have seen her mother, Pepper, on there at some point. Teigen clearly inherited her formidable cooking skills from her mama, and in this book, the spotlight is finally cast on the Thailand-born Pepper who showcases a wide range of recipes inspired by her homeland and sprinkled with her indefatigable sense of humour.In this cookbook, you’ll discover a host of appealing recipes such as chilli-lime fried cashews, naked shrimp salad, garlic stuffed fish and pad Thai Brussels sprouts. The 80 recipes in the book aren’t all necessarily authentic – Pepper herself alludes to this as she has made modifications since moving to live in the United States (her papaya salad doesn’t always have papaya in it!) – but they are all heavily influenced by her Thai roots and certainly offer an interesting range.Also, if you’re a bit of a star-gazer, you’ll enjoy the fact that the book is literally peppered (pun intended!) with images of Teigen, her music mogul husband John Legend and their two children, Luna and Miles. The images were probably intentionally positioned to add to the allure of the book and it’s a marketing strategy that definitely pays off in leaps and bounds because you’ll spend as much time poring over the charming family photographs as you will staring at the gorgeous images of the food.So if you’re after a selection of Thai-centric meals to spice up your family meals – in much the same way Pepper has jazzed up the Legend household’s daily fare – you’ll love this cookbook.The Sourdough School Sweet BakingAuthor: Vanessa KimbellPublisher: Kyle BooksPrice: RM150This seminal book is written by celebrated sourdough advocate Vanessa Kimbell, an award-winning author who runs The Sourdough School in the British county of Northamptonshire.In this inspiring tome, Kimbell examines how sourdough baking can help enhance gut microbiome and consequently improve health and mental wellbeing.Although sourdough, gut health and mental health seem dubiously incapable of being interconnected, research has shown that switching to a healthy diet has about the same effect on our bodies as an antidepressant. Also, according to Kimbell, when our gut microbiome is out of balance, it can lead to chronic inflammation that can in turn cause food allergies, autoimmune disorders and, yes, mental health issues.The book contains fascinating nuggets of information about how the gut is indelibly linked to wellness. For example, did you know that 50% of the body’s feel-good neurotransmitter dopamine is located in the gut? Or that eating grains has been shown to modulate the microbes in the gut?Although the chunks of information that preface the recipes are lengthy and fairly technical, don’t skip them because this is what gives this cookbook an added edge and will help guide you on your journey to making successful sourdough that nourishes mind, body and soul.Recipes in the book include mulberry galette, wild blackberry tarts, brioche and live sourdough doughnuts.Ultimately, whether you’ve been trying to crack the sourdough bread code or simply wanting to eat food that makes you feel better, this book offers recipes to get you started as well as a whole lot of information on how to improve your gut health and overall wellbeing.Enjoy your comfort food at better prices with Lalamove Promo Code\n",

      "Idah Ayu Natalia Ibrahim is huddled around a small table in her colourful, quirky kitchen. Watching her movements with rapt attention are her three daughters – Alia Nurcinta, 18, Alicia Nurcinta, 16, and Ally Nurcinta, 11.Ayu deftly folds a piece of banana leaf into a nifty looking pocket, which she then begins filling with glutinous rice. Once this endeavour is complete, she folds the leaf again, shaping it into a triangle, before securing the finished parcel with string.While Ayu is evidently practised in the art of folding and moulding these little parcels – called lopes pulut, her children are having varying degrees of success putting their own parcels together.“Bocor!” yells daughter Alia, bemoaning a packet that has split open. Youngest daughter Ally is struggling and stops to stare in wonder at her mother’s perfect products. “Mummy buat elok sahaja (When mummy does it, it turns out so well), ” she says, as she attempts to recreate what her mother has done.Although her children haven’t quite figured out the knack behind lopes-making just yet, Ayu is determined that they persevere in making these heritage sweet treats, in the same way she grew up doing it too.“Every Raya since I was small, I had to do simple tasks given by my mother, like shaping and wrapping lopes.“And for my six siblings and I, Raya wasn’t just one day, it was one whole month, because my mum would have people over every day for a month. And each day, she would prepare different dishes for the guests who came to visit. It was tiring but so much fun, ” she says.Ayu is the daughter of acclaimed cookbook author Datin Hamidah Abdul Hamid whose cookbooks Johor Palate: Tanjung Puteri Recipes and Malaysia’s Culinary Heritage: The Best of Authentic Traditional Recipes – co-written with her cousin Datin Kalsom Taib – have bagged awards at the prestigious Gourmand World Cookbook Awards.As a result, Ayu is deeply aware of the need to preserve heritage food, like the kuih she grew up with. Consequenly, she has since taken over some of the cooking and baking roles previously occupied by her mother, who is now 71 and getting increasingly tired.“It’s part of our heritage, that’s why my sisters and I have taken over – we are the next generation that actually uses these recipes in our homes, ” explains Ayu.Chief among Ayu’s kuih-making endeavours is her famed lopes pulut, a Johor dessert that her mother used to make and which she has since become known in family circles for. The dish is essentially made up of glutinous rice (pulut) and grated coconut, drizzled with palm sugar. The technical aspect of the kuih is in the notoriously laborious (and labyrinthine) process of folding the glutinous rice into banana leaves.“It’s simple, but the tedious part is the wrapping, so everyone gets together for that. It can be torturous for my kids to do – they will try to do it, and then they will be like, ‘Oh mum, no!’Ayu’s version of lopes is delightful – plump glutinous rice coated in grated coconut, with palm sugar forming a delighful caramel-esque counterpoint to the concoction.Among her relatives, Ayu’s lopes is so revered that her aunts even buy kilos’ worth of the kuih from her for their own Hari Raya celebrations!“Most of my aunties will order 3kg or 4kg of lopes from me, because I’m the family lopes-maker. If I don’t make lopes for Hari Raya, everyone will be like, ‘Ayu, where’s your lopes?’” says Ayu, giggling.Another kuih that Ayu always makes for Hari Raya is kole kacang, a traditional coconut-rich indulgent dessert that has pride of place in Johor culinary history and is sadly quite hard to find these days.Kole kacang is made using green bean flour, palm sugar and coconut cream, but the truly unique thing about it is the topping scattered atop, which is fashioned out of coconut cream stirred on low heat until it reduces and forms oil crumbs (tahi minyak).“I didn’t like it when I was younger, because to me, this kind of kuih was reserved for the elderly. But I acquired a taste for it when I was in my late teens, so that’s why I started making it myself for Hari Raya, ” says Ayu.Her kole kacang is yummy – thick, almost pudding-ey slabs of kuih that have a melt-in-the-mouth texture. But the real star player here is the topping – crunchy little coconut-infused shards that crumble upon contact with your palate and elevate the kuih to a different dimension altogether.In recent years, Ayu has also added another rare Johor heritage kuih to her arsenal of Hari Raya desserts, and this is one is especially precious because the recipe was personally given to her by YAM Tunku Kamariah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah, the Tunku Puteri of Johor.“Bludall is a royal dessert that I got from the Johor princess. We have been family friends since I was small and she knows that I like to keep and preserve old recipes, so she gave this to me, ” says Ayu.The dessert is very similar to a cupcake and is moist and dense with a sticky top and underlying egg-laced nuances. It has a simple flavour profile but is also incredibly fulfilling and ultimately, really quite addictive.It is also a closely-guarded royal family recipe that you are unlikely to find anywhere, simply because it has never been shared before.“It’s never been revealed and not many people know to make it, except maybe people whose families have worked in the palace. Also there is some skill involved in making this, because the dough takes a long time to rise, so you have to be patient, ” says Ayu.While Ayu is scaling back her kuih-making this year, given the Covid-19 global pandemic and the fact that her full family gathering won’t be a possibility, she is determined to continue making small batches of her heritage treats.“We’re going to have a potluck Hari Raya with my siblings, so I will definitely be making all the kuih – I just don’t have to make so much this year!” she says, laughing.Ultimately, Ayu says the reason she is so determined to continue making these heritage kuih with her children is because she wants the tradition to continue.“It’s important because food makes everyone comes together and everybody looks forward to these things as they get older. And the culture of making kuih is slowly disappearing, it is very difficult now to find traditional kuih made the traditional way. A lot of people are modernising and modifying recipes.“So it is crucial to me that my girls and my son know the recipes and make and preserve them. So later when I’m older and I don’t have the energy to do it, at least I know I can go to their houses and eat it!” she says, laughing.LOPES PULUTFor the pulut1kg glutinous rice1 tsp edible slaked lime waterbanana leaves, cut into rectanglesWash the glutinous rice and soak in some water and the edible slaked lime water for about 30 minutes. Wash and drain.Fold a banana leaf in half to make a cone-shaped pocket at each end and fill with glutinous rice. Fold over the end to make a complete triangle. Tightly secure with a piece of string to make triangular shaped parcels. Repeat until all the glutinous rice is finished.Bring a pot of salted water to boil. Immerse the lopes parcels in the water and boil for 30 to 40 minutes, or until cooked. Remove from the pot and leave to cool.For the syrup400g shaved palm sugar8 tbsp sugar300ml water2 pandan leaves, knottedCombine all the ingredients in a pot and boil until the sugar dissolves and syrup thickens.

      "In his daughter’s sparkling kitchen, Rusli Kamaruddin, 65, is hard at work, his face a rictus of concentration as he bends over a parcel of cooked glutinous rice. Flattening it carefully, he places spoonfuls of serunding ayam in the centre of the rice before rolling it up in banana leaves and tying the ends with string.After completing one himself, he turns his attentions to his daughter Nurliyana Rusli’s concoction. Although Nurliyana is herself a trained chef who has worked in illustrious restaurants in Australia, it is her father who is clearly the boss in this kitchen.“Tekan kuat sikit (press a little harder)” he urges Nurliyana, as she works to craft a replica of the kuih her father has just painstakingly put together. She does as he says, and Rusli’s eyes light up with pride and affection, his face breaking into a wide, adorable smile.“I have four daughters but only Liyana is interested in making this traditional kuih, so I am teaching her, ” explains Rusli.Rusli has been making an arsenal of traditional Javanese kuih for over 50 years now, based on his own grandmother’s family recipes, which are well over 100 years old. In Rusli’s family, Javanese culture and traditions have been staunchly defended and maintained, even though his grandmother migrated from west Java to Malaysia nearly a century ago.Javanese migration to Malaysia dates back to as early as the sixth century and reached a climax in the pre-independence era. In the early days of settling in Malaysia, many people of Javanese descent worked hard to keep their identities intact, retaining their language, traditions and food. But over the decades, many have inter-married with local Malays and a large percentage of the cultural practices have consequently been discarded or forgotten in the assimilation process.Rusli himself stills speaks the Javanese language (Bahasa Jawa), as do his siblings, although he admits that many of the cultural practices like traditional kuih-making (which Javanese people put on a pedestal) are slowly disappearing with time.Worried that his community’s traditions will be lost altogether, Rusli is continuing to do his bit to preserve his roots, an appreciation he himself developed from a young age.Growing up in Kuala Kangsar, Perak, he revelled in the Javanese culture, specifically the cooking and baking that typically accompanied festive occasions like weddings, kenduri and Hari Raya.Which is why as a teenager, he began cooking and baking himself – first to feed his family’s needs and then to satiate his own burgeoning interest in Javanese culinary practices.“When I was younger, I always watched my mother cooking and baking. But I only started doing it myself when I was 14. I was in afternoon school and I was the only one at home in the mornings, as my siblings were at school and my parents were labourers who worked as rubber tappers in the mornings and paddy farmers in the afternoons. So I used to go to the market and buy all the ingredients to cook meals for the whole family – that’s how I started.“And even with these traditional Javanese kuih, I watched my mother making it for years before I started making it as a teenager. No one had ovens then, so she used to bake the old-fashioned way using a pot placed over charcoal fire, so that’s how I learnt to bake too. I would give my kuih to my parents to taste, and when they said it was okay, I knew I was on the right track, ” says Rusli.In many ways, Rusli’s Hari Raya kuih-making is heavily influenced by the nostalgia of his halcyon days in his kampung, when dining tables were often heaving with all kinds of kuih.“In the old days, for Hari Raya, each house that you went to, the table would be filled from end to end with 20 to 30 different kinds of traditional kuih Raya. It was so fun to see all the kuih laid out like that. I used to go to people’s homes and count the different kinds of kuih and compare to see who made the most kuih!” he says.In Rusli’s home, the tradition of making a multitude of Javanese kuih has persevered and every year, he consistently makes a few of his favourites. Like kuih sagun, a crisp, brittle biscuit-like concoction with rich tropical overtures that only calls for the use of three ingredients – grated coconut, glutinous rice flour and sugar.“In the old days, when I was young, we would make kuih sagun a week before Hari Raya, because it is quite long-lasting. Nowadays, it is hard to find people who make it and many people have also modified the original recipe and added ingredients like butter and eggs, so it is no longer the original version, ” says Rusli.Rusli also says that the interesting thing about kuih sagun is that it was devised in response to ingredients that were readily available. This availability also extended to the utensils on hand, which is why many old-fashioned recipes for this sweet treat often use the lids of jars or tins as moulds.Another Hari Raya kuih that is a must-have in Rusli’s home is bakpia Teflon, which is a little like fried bread dough filled with all sorts of fillings in the ilk of red beans, pineapples and peanut butter (Rusli’s personal favourite). The round parcels are typically fried in Teflon-coated pans (which likely gave rise to its name) or baked in the oven until golden brown.The resulting concoction is truly addictive – the soft, chewy texture of the bread gives way to an interior stuffed with peanut butter, in what proves to be a remarkable marriage of flavours and textures.“I rarely see this kuih nowadays, I think it is mainly old people who continue to make it. The thing about traditional kuih recipes is that they are simple, but you cannot make mistakes in the execution – that’s why I think younger people prefer modern dessert recipes, ” says Rusli.Rusli’s lemper pulut ayam is another kuih that makes a regular appearance every Hari Raya. This savoury treat is essentially glutinous rice (pulut) topped with serunding and rolled and sliced into discs. The dish is delightful – soft glutinous rice giving way to the addictive qualities of serunding, which in turns imparts so much flavour in each mouthful.“This is a Hari Raya staple, sometimes people use it in place of lemang. It’s a kind of Javanese savoury kuih that I grew up eating, but it is gradually being phased out and is difficult to find anywhere now, ” says Rusli.Although Rusli typically celebrates Hari Raya with his large extended family in Kuala Kangsar, this year, his will be celebrating with his daughters in Kuala Lumpur instead (he has been here for awhile already).Even though he doesn’t really need to exert himself – given the limited number of people, Rusli has already assured his children that all their favourite kuih will still be on the table come Hari Raya.“This year, I will make a small quantity of kuih, because that’s enough for everyone. But I have to do it, so that my children don’t forget their roots and the heritage meals inherited from my ancestors – even if we only make it once a year.“And now that Liyana has taken the initiative to learn how to make the kuih, I am so glad that this legacy will continue, ” he says, smiling.LEMPER PULUT AYAMFor the serunding ayam filling1/2 tsp fennel1/2 tsp cumin1/2 tsp coriander seeds10 small red onions5 cloves garlic3 candlenuts (buah keras)2 tbsp dried anchovies/shrimp, optional2 tbsp coconut oil2 bay leaves2.5cm galangal, thinly sliced2 stalks lemongrass, bruised1/2 chicken, boiled and shredded500ml coconut creamsalt and sugar to taste200g to 300g grated coconut, dry-fried until brownIn a blender, blend fennel, cumin, coriander, onions, garlic, candlenuts and dried shrimp.

Cover dough and let rise at room temperature, this should take about 1 hour.Form the dough into palm-sized balls. Flatten and put 1 to 2 tablespoons of peanut butter in the middle of the balls and fold over to cover filling.Pan-fry the buns in a pan on low heat until golden brown or bake in oven at 150°C for 30 minutes.KUIH SAGUN2 cups grated coconut1 3/4 cups glutinous rice flour1/2 cup castor sugarPre-heat oven to 150°C.Fry coconut and rice flour together until it dries up but before any browning occurs.

      "DAGING harimau menangis is a direct translation of the original Thai dish, sua rong hai, or in English, crying tiger beef.It is a barbecued dish of heavily seasoned beef served with a spicy dipping sauce, and usually eaten as a lettuce wrap or with steamed rice.Its name is derived from local anecdotes on cattle that had been mauled by tigers and the carcasses then recovered from the jungle.Villagers would collect the remains,usually the brisket or bottom sirloin – parts which the tiger was said to have left uneaten due to the bones obstructing the flesh.According to the folklore, since the tigers were deprived of the enjoyment of these parts of the beef, they were said to cry, hence the name of the dish.It is also said that the beef brisket, called tiger meat in Thailand, consists of layered meat and fat which resembles tiger skin.And as the meat is charbroiled, the dripping fat resembles teardrops, in addition to the stripes of the grill marks, all of which also allude to the tiger’s ‘presence’ in the dish.Daging harimau menangis made headlines recently when a businesswoman tried to patent the name.Even after she retracted her bid, the social media storm that followed not only brought greater awareness of this dish, it also entrenched its Thai origins.This dish is very popular in many Thai food courts and street stalls, with each vendor boasting their own unique recipe.The standard marinade consists of salt, sugar, pepper and fish sauce, with the addition of soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic or coriander in its many variants.The brisket cut of meat is one that contains a lot of connective tissues, so you either have to cook it very slowly over a long time, or briefly at very high heat, to no more than medium.Another way to tenderise it is to pound it with a mallet to break down some of the long and criss-crossed fibres.The recipe is so simple that anyone can prepare this dish at home.The meat just needs to be marinated for about half a day until it is almost cured.Then, briefly charbroil over an open fire or grill in a cast-iron skillet, keeping the meat medium-rare.It can also be grilled in the oven but it will be harder to control its doneness.It is served with a spicy dipping sauce, variants of which may include chilli flakes, tamarind and palm sugar instead of fresh chillies, lime and sugar.This is an excellent dish to grill at the table if you have a hibachi or electric grill at home.Served hot off the grill, these morsels of meat wrapped in lettuce are a great communal dish.Sua Rong Hai/ Daging Harimau Menangis/ Crying Tiger BeefMarinade500g beef brisket4 cloves garlic1 tsp black pepper2 tsp salt4 tbsp oyster sauce3 tbsp fish sauce3 tbsp kicap manis4 tbsp brown sugarThai-style dipping sauce6 cloves garlic10 pods green bird’s eye chilli3 tsp oyster sauce2 tsp fish sauce3 tsp brown sugarjuice from 1 lime1 shallot, finely sliced2 pods red bird’s eye chilli, finely sliced1 sprig coriander, mincedMethodSlice beef to half-centimetre-thick strips.

      "There is now evidence that the Covid-19 pandemic is influencing the expected lifespans of people in several parts of the world. One would expect this effect to be greatest in under-developed nations in places like South America and South Asia, but in fact, it also significantly affects developed countries in North America and the European Union.And oddly, depending on how one measures life expectancy, this may have been a trend even before the pandemic. A productive lifespan is probably more affected by our lifestyles and diets than the pandemic, and the following explains why.Life expectancyFirstly, let us consider metrics for measuring life expectancy. Most people would know the main measure to be Period Life Expectancy at Birth (PLEB), which would be the expected period a person is statistically predicted to live from birth.A known problem with PLEB is that it is a static measure based on conditions prevailing at birth and are often relevant only to specific locations. And it is a generic measure which does not consider idiosyncrasies such as genetic diseases.So, when a serious turbulent pandemic hits, other metrics are required to measure the true impact rather than just a meaningless downward adjustment of PLEB (as the PLEB can include segments of the population not as affected by the pandemic, such as young children).One such measure is the Mean Unfulfilled Lifespan (MUL) which measures the difference between the PLEB and the average age at death of the same individuals in a pandemic-afflicted population. The MUL can also be recalibrated for shorter intervals (e.g., quarterly, monthly or even weekly periods) which can provide an independent assessment of the nature and progress of the pandemic.The MUL was applied to 159 national populations and 122 sub-national populations in Italy, Mexico, Spain and the US and the 2020 results raised some interesting statistics. Using a seven-day rolling window, the MUL peaked at 9.12 years in Madrid, 9.20 years in New York, 9.15 years in Baja California, and in Guayas (Ecuador) it even reached 12.6 years for the whole month of April 2020.In short, people in some parts of the world were suffering mortality rates on average around 10 years earlier than the PLEB. However, using selected short periods such a rolling 7-day window, can introduce bias so a longer period is required to provide a degree of smoothing. Using quarterly data, the highest MUL values in national populations were obtained for Ecuador (5.12 years, 2nd quarter 2020) and Peru (4.56 years, 3rd quarter 2020).In sub-national populations, the MUL for New York was 5.52 years (2nd quarter 2020), New Jersey was 5.56 years (2nd quarter 2020) and Baja California was 5.19 years (4th quarter 2020). The MUL showed that the pandemic was, in effect, even worse in parts of the USA than poorer countries in South America for certain periods.PLEB is increasing?The curious thing is that PLEB was increasing for much of the world until the pandemic hit last year. This should of course be seen as a huge success for modern healthcare and disease control, despite the limitations of using such a simple metric.Even so, the PLEB dropped 5 years in a row in the USA, between 2014 and 2018. A major effect on PLEB therefore was not the Covid-19 pandemic, but something worse and mostly self-inflicted.And this is the diets of people. In recent years bad diets had reached some inflection point when lifestyles started to impact the PLEB.There is always going to be an upper limit to average human longevity, perhaps roughly 85 years, currently achieved by Hong Kong and Japan, though many parts of the world are catching up. But this longevity increase in many countries is achieved despite a huge contradiction.Rates of diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disorders, and other chronic diseases are also at all-time highs in many countries, mainly due to population lifestyles and diets. Yet, paradoxically, people are living longer. This contradiction can only be explained by the fact that people are living longer but in a less healthy state.One can therefore suggest medical and healthcare achievements are keeping people alive even as they are getting sicker each year. There is some evidence to support this. For example, if we adopt a measure called Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE for short), the estimate for men in the USA is a HALE of 11 years less than the PLEB, while women have a HALE of 13 years less than their PLEB. This means people in the USA spend on average over a decade of their lives in a sickened condition, requiring various degrees of healthcare and/or expensive medications.As an industry, the medical and pharmaceutical businesses should want the HALE age to be as far below as possible from the PLEB age as then there would be a larger time window available for medical services and pharmaceutical products. This is of course a cynical view often promoted by crank health websites.The more likely and fairer interpretation is that the medical and pharmaceutical businesses are simply adapting their services and products to suit the lifestyles and diets of their customers.A longer HALEThe obvious target therefore is for people to improve HALE ages to be as close to PLEB ages as possible. This usually mean lifestyle and diet changes, which although often small and of no great consequence, can make significant differences to the HALE age.Examples may be a higher intake of greens combined with a reduction of meat consumption, both dietary choices which are also good for the environment. Another case may be more cooking at home with organic ingredients, good oils, and less additives. Or taking more exercise.The current pandemic has offered everyone an opportunity to reset and re-evaluate their lives and dietary options. But judging from sales of fast foods such as burgers and fried chicken (via home deliveries), people appear to be eating as much unhealthy junk food as before.There was a hope most people would revise their junk diets during the lockdowns last year, but annual junk food sales figures proved this was probably not the case. Too many people are simply too addicted to junk food even in the middle of a dangerous pandemic.The outcome of this may already be a factor in the sobering MUL statistics mentioned above. The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus disproportionately targets people with various morbidities and co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and various chronic diseases.This could explain the higher MUL rates for several periods last year in the affluent USA compared to poorer countries. Over 35% of the US population are medically obese (BMI of 30 or higher), and a high percentage also have other morbidities, so the higher MUL rates were likely an indication of the poor overall health of much of the US population, which may not have been exposed so starkly before.So, the choices are, and have always been, available to everyone. It is a matter of juggling personal choices against lifespan metrics such as HALE, PLEB and MUL (during global health events).\n",

      "For centuries, mothers in Asia have played pivotal roles in home kitchens across the continent. From China to India to Malaysia, women have been the arteries pumping life into the heart of traditional home-cooked meals, which they dutifully churned out day after day to feed their hungry families. In many instances, this responsibility was fulfilled largely out of obligation and in response to what had become a clearly defined gender role.In Baba Nyonya communities for instance, recipes were often tightly guarded by family matriarchs who only passed them down the female line i.e. to their daughters or daughters-in-law.This gender-based hierarchical structure led to the development of old-fashioned platitudes like ‘The way to a man’s heart is through his stomach’ and ‘Cooking is how a mother expresses her love’ and more derogatory expressions like ‘A woman’s place is in the kitchen’ – all evidence that cooking was a predominantly female-led activity (whether a woman was interested in it or not).The oft-repeated trope that fathers were the breadwinners and heads of the household reinforced this belief that a woman’s role was to cook and clean and look after her children.But as with many things in life, the passage of time has changed this previously set-in-stone pattern somewhat. It began in the mid 20th century with an increasing number of women getting access to higher education, which in turn led to an influx of women joining the workforce. This has carved out different paths for many mothers who now straddle the responsibilities of child-rearing and housework with the travails of working life.For contrast, in 1970, female labour force participation in Malaysia was 30%. In 2020, it was nearly 56%. The increase in the number of full-time working mothers over the years (and mothers who work part-time, freelance or run their own home businesses) has had a trickle-down effect in terms of the structure and means in which feeding a family has changed.In 2021, many busy mothers have discovered that in order to provide nutritious meals for their families, a little help, some innovation and adaptation (and a few cheat days) go a long way towards satiating their children.Feeding the familyWhen business development manager Ong Leah Lee married her husband Kelvin Tan, the couple mostly ate out in restaurants or went to Ong’s mother’s house for home-cooked meals. But once they became parents, Ong and Tan decided that things had to change drastically if they wanted their children to grow up eating healthy, nutritious meals.Which is why Ong and her husband now take turns making the daily meals for their four-year-old daughter Helena Tan and nine-month-old son Ethan Tan. This way, they can split the cooking duties evenly so the onus isn’t always on one person and whoever isn’t cooking gets to spend quality time with the children.“I work from home at the moment and so does my husband and we both normally finish around 5pm. We have a live-in nanny who looks after the children and handles their daily lunch, but for dinner, my husband and I decide who will take over the cooking for the day.“We are quite fair about this division and split it according to the meal we feel like having for the day. He is good at cooking Western meals, so he is in charge of that and I am more influenced by the Chinese-style meals my mother taught me, so I often cook that. Kelvin also likes baking, so he makes a lot of desserts, kuih and even fresh bread for our breakfast daily.Ong says her daughter also enjoys helping out, which is why she fully intends to teach both her children how to cook when they are older.“My daughter is always saying, ‘Mum, can I help you do this?’ when I am cooking. So I plan to train her and her brother to cook from a young age, so this becomes a family activity, ” says Ong.Legal counsel Lynn Ann Johnson has also discovered that it takes two to get everyday meals going, especially when parents have equally busy jobs.Lynn and her husband Noel Anthony Raj used to eat out frequently at restaurants or order food in, as they both have demanding jobs.Everything changed once they had their daughter Nicole Alena Raj, 8, though. These days, Lynn and her husband run a tight ship and have a schedule mapped out between the two of them, so that the family gets healthy, home-cooked meals every single day.“How it works for us is if I’m making a big meal over the weekend, I freeze it and keep it so this lasts a couple of days over the week. But if that runs out, then my husband and I have this shift going. I wake up at 4am every morning and sort breakfast and lunch out for everyone and then take my daughter to school.“My husband comes back earlier than me in the evenings, so he gets dinner going, whether that’s making a fresh batch of pasta or a rice-based meal. And that’s how we work throughout the weekdays. On the weekends, we visit either his parents or my parents, and both our mums always make food for us to pack and take back, so that also lasts through part of the week sometimes, ” says Lynn.Lynn says without her husband pitching in, her family simply wouldn’t be able to enjoy home-cooked meals every day, as between the traffic jam and her long commute, she is simply too exhausted to cook every single meal every single day.“Oh, it definitely helps because I cannot get back home in time to make dinner. I finish work at about 6.30pm and I am stuck in traffic for at least two hours en route back home, so cooking at that time is a pointless exercise.“So we’ve done this for years, because we don’t have help. It’s just the three of us at home, so we’ve got a really good schedule where we take turns, because if not, we’d go mad, you know?” she says, laughing.For insurance agent Shamini Krishnan, cooking is a task that she has become extremely adept at, having cooked for her dad for years before her children Suvharn Raj, five, and Pavhaarn Raj, two, were born.As her husband Theeban Raj works long hours and often comes home late, Shamini and her domestic helper craft the family’s daily meals together.Still, she finds that it takes discipline to juggle work and cooking, which is why she plans the family meals at least a day in advance and makes sure her fridge is always stocked up with essential ingredients.“Every day from 9am to 1pm, I manage my insurance appointments. I also have a business as a reseller, so I try and do all my work within those hours. After that, if I have no appointments, I will cook lunch. If I cannot manage the cooking, I make sure that I prepare all the ingredients on alternate days, so my helper can do the cooking and I can continue working.“I normally also cook dinner and take charge of all the weekend meals, but if I’m not around, my husband takes over the cooking. But I actually enjoy cooking so it’s basically about managing my time well, ” she says.Khairun Nisa Mohamed Zabidi, a sustainability expert who is the head of the UK Partnerships for Accelerated Climate Transitions (PACT) programme at the British High Commission KL, has discovered that as a single mum, leaning on her extended family has helped immeasurably in ensuring that her children Aidan Salahuddin Conrad, 9, and Aria Khadija Conrad, 7, are fed.“I live 10 minutes away from my parents’ house so my kids spend a lot of time with them and have their daily lunches and dinners there. At the beginning of the pandemic, I did try making lunch for them but it was just too tiring to do that, clean up after and work as well – it was driving me up the wall, so I stopped, ” she says.Over the weekends, Khairun does sometimes cook, but more importantly, she has taught her kids how to cook so that they are self-sufficient and can whip up a meal if the need arises.“I taught my kids to cook a few years ago and they come grocery shopping with me too, so they always know what’s in the pantry. I have been doing this with them since they could read.“So like a couple of weeks ago, I got really sick and couldn’t cook, so my son made some pasta for the family meal, ” says Khairun, with pride.What’s cooking?All the mums I spoke to grew up eating mostly traditional Asian food – whether that was rice and curry, Chinese-style steamed fish and soups or Malay lauk.But since having children of their own, many have deviated somewhat from traditional recipes, given their workloads and the time constraints that they face in this busy modern world.“Oh I think people are definitely deviating from traditional recipes. Like I have my mum’s recipe for chicken curry and it’s all from scratch. She doesn’t use store-bought meat curry powder – she actually grinds everything on her own. If I were to follow the recipe to a tee, it would take forever! And it defeats the purpose to buy a pre-mix pack and make chicken curry, because it’s just not the same, ” explains Lynn.Which is why Lynn and her husband make a lot of quick, easy, healthy meals instead, like pastas, salads and wraps, which can be made fresh and fast. She also uses her oven and air-fryer a lot and avoids oily, fried food or fast food.“There are some days though when we are too tired or too lazy and we actually just have a sandwich and we are okay with that sandwich, because it’s a proper, full-on egg or tuna or roasted chicken sandwich and it only takes about 15 minutes to make, ” says Lynn.Ong and her husband meanwhile either make Chinese food or Western meals, depending on who is doing the cooking for the day.“Everything we cook is fresh and spontaneous, sometimes we have traditional Chinese food like stir-fried vegetables and steamed fish. And sometimes we make quick Western food like pasta. My daughter likes soup noodles, so I make that for her every day as it’s quite easy – I just need to make the soup and throw in vegetables, meat and noodles.“We want the kids to have a balanced diet, so all our meals have a lot of vegetables and protein, like fish. We eat a lot of fish, ” she says, laughing.Ong also adds that although she uses her mother’s traditional Chinese agak-agak style recipes, she has modernised it somewhat with the use of implements like pressure cookers.“I actually think cooking all these traditional dishes is much easier now, we can modernise the recipe and use tools like blenders and pressure cookers. Also there are better ingredient choices, so overall even though we have less time, we can do more efficient cooking, ” she says.For Khairun, her priority is simply ensuring that her kids are fed, although she does try and get them to eat healthy meals. While she often might make salads and roast a fish or chicken for her children, there are also days when she utilises cooking sauces to expedite the process of making traditional Asian meals.“I have a stack of premix cooking sauces and I just add some meat or vegetables to that, and typically these meals will be the same as what my mum used to make when I was growing up – rice, one or two meat dishes and a vegetable dish, ” she says.Shamini on the other hand, works hard to ensure her sons enjoy their meals, which is why she strives to make a varied range of Asian dishes to suit her kids’ preferences and tastes.“I think when we were young, we just ate whatever our mothers cooked – I mean, I ate rice and Indian dishes every day as a kid. But children now can be very picky. My five-year-old will ask me, “Amma, what have you cooked today?’ and go and see what is on the table. If he likes it, he will eat it, if he doesn’t, it is very hard to get him to eat it.“So I look up a lot of different recipes on YouTube and vary the meals accordingly. Like my youngest likes vegetables so I might make stir-fried vegetables with prawns for him while my eldest likes more robust dishes like ayam kicap, so I will make that for him.“I try and mix and match and make colourful meals because I want my kids to be happy and enjoy their meals, even though it takes more time and effort to do this. But when my five-year-old son comes up to me and says, ‘Amma, you are the best cook’, that just melts my heart, ” she says.\n",

      "DAGING harimau menangis is a direct translation of the original Thai dish, sua rong hai, or in English, crying tiger beef.It is a barbecued dish of heavily seasoned beef served with a spicy dipping sauce, and usually eaten as a lettuce wrap or with steamed rice.Its name is derived from local anecdotes on cattle that had been mauled by tigers and the carcasses then recovered from the jungle.Villagers would collect the remains, usually the brisket or bottom sirloin --- parts which the tiger was said to have left uneaten due to the bones obstructing the flesh.According to the folklore, since the tigers were deprived of the enjoyment of these parts of the beef, they were said to cry, hence the name of the dish.It is also said that the beef brisket, called tiger meat in Thailand, consists of layered meat and fat which resembles tiger skin.And as the meat is charbroiled, the dripping fat resembles teardrops, in addition to the stripes of the grill marks, all of which also allude to the tiger’s “presence” in the dish.Daging harimau menangis made headlines recently when a businesswoman tried to patent the name.Even after she retracted her bid, the social media storm that followed not only brought greater awareness of this dish, it also entrenched its Thai origins.This dish is very popular in many Thai food courts and street stalls, with each vendor boasting their own unique recipe.The standard marinade consists of salt, sugar, pepper and fish sauce, with the addition of soy sauce, oyster sauce, garlic or coriander in its many variants.The brisket cut of meat is one that contains a lot of connective tissues, so you either have to cook it very slowly over a long time, or briefly at very high heat, to no more than medium.Another way to tenderise it is to pound it with a mallet to break down some of the long and criss-crossed fibres.The recipe is so simple that anyone can prepare this dish at home.The meat just needs to be marinated for about half a day until it is almost cured.Then, briefly charbroil over an open fire or grill in a cast-iron skillet, keeping the meat medium-rare.It can also be grilled in the oven, but it will be harder to control its doneness.It is served with a spicy dipping sauce, variants of which may include chilli flakes, tamarind and palm sugar instead of fresh chillies, lime and sugar.This is an excellent dish to grill at the table if you have a hibachi or electric grill at home.Served hot off the grill, these morsels of meat wrapped in lettuce are a great communal dish.Sua Rong Hai/ Daging Harimau Menangis/ Crying Tiger BeefMarinade500g beef brisket4 cloves garlic1 tsp black pepper2 tsp salt4 tbsp oyster sauce3 tbsp fish sauce3 tbsp kicap manis4 tbsp brown sugarThai-style dipping sauce6 cloves garlic10 pods green bird’s eye chilli3 tsp oyster sauce2 tsp fish sauce3 tsp brown sugarjuice from 1 lime1 shallot, finely sliced2 pods red bird’s eye chilli, finely sliced1 sprig coriander, mincedMethodSlice beef to half-centimetre-thick strips.

      "GATHERING with friends or family has always been a mainstay during the holy month of Ramadan.Traditionally a communal experience, this year’s buka puasa will undoubtedly be different with Covid-19 still afflicting the country.But those observing Ramadan can still experience a smaller gathering with their loved ones at home, courtesy of St Regis Kuala Lumpur.The hotel is offering a Malam Warisan Melayu Box, a takeaway option.ADVERTISINGThere are two takeaway sets, designed for four and eight persons respectively, and include the hotel’s signature dishes.This time around, the focus will be on local dishes, taking diners on a culinary journey through Malaysia’s 14 states.The recipes are courtesy of executive sous chef Norazizi Taslim and banquet chef Mohd Ridzwan Mohamed Rasit.A notable dish is the Smoked Lamb Shank with fresh turmeric and bird’s eye chillies.This Negri Sembilan speciality is similar to other masak lemak (coconut milk-based dishes) but here the meat and spices are simmered and cooked in only water, with no added oil.The meat is smoked for several hours with kaffir lime leaves and chillies.Fresh coconut milk is used to dial down the heat to render a slightly sweet flavour.One dish to savour is the Rendang Tok — a Perak speciality by Norazizi.Traditionally made with buffalo meat, here beef short ribs are used and braised for six hours for a melt-in-your-mouth experience.The meat was flavourful, while the added roasted coconut helped enhance the flavours of the spices.For those who enjoy seafood, the Smoked Red Snapper with coconut, green chilli and kerisik has a similar flavour profile to the lamb shank.The fish is smoked before being cooked in gravy, lending it that nice aromatic smoky flavour.This Kelantanese speciality was slightly spicy and sweet, enhanced by the smoked fish.Also part of the takeaway set is a selection of kerabu appetisers.Sabah’s kerabu features a fiddlehead fern salad, while Perlis’ kerabu daging is a traditional beef salad with a chilli and coconut dressing.Both were fresh and an interesting introduction to these two states. The takeaway sets also includea selection of sweet treats such as pomelo sago, pineapple tart, nutmeg madeleines and soursop pops.The Malam Warisan Melayu Box is priced at RM448+ (serves up to four people) and RM888+ (for up to eight people). Orders must be placed 48 hours in advance.This offer continues even after Ramadan.ST REGIS KUALA LUMPUR, No.6, Jalan Stesen Sentral 2, Kuala Lumpur. (Tel: 03-2727 6696).

      "Clean energy giants are finding a shortage of workers with the skills needed to support their ambitious growth plans.The renewables jobs market is heating up and candidates with the right abilities are becoming harder to find, according to Miguel Stilwell, chief executive officer at Portuguese clean-energy firm EDP Renovaveis SA. The company is one of the world’s top installers of green power and plans to hire 1,300 employees over the next two years.\"There’s a war over talent globally,” Stilwell said in an interview on May 28. \"The renewable sector, given the massive amount of growth that is expected, doesn’t have enough people.”As countries funnel billions of dollars into developing renewable power, policymakers are banking on the sector to create new jobs that are crucial for the post-pandemic economic recovery.Solar generation capacity is expected to triple by the end of the decade, while wind capacity is expected to more than double over the same period, according to clean energy research group BloombergNEF.Green supermajors such as NextEra Energy Inc, Iberdrola SA, Enel SpA and EDP are leading the race to electrify the global economy. But some large oil companies are starting to get into the sector too, with BP Plc announcing last month it’s looking to fill 100 offshore-wind jobs in the UK and the US, a figure that could double by the end of the year.Engineering skills such as energy assessment, project management and project design are in high demand, EDP’s Stilwell said. Good business developers who understand clean energy technologies are also a scarce resource. Other roles, such as managing mergers and acquisitions, or back office tasks, can easily be hired from other industries.\"We’re having to bring in people from other sectors, whether it’s oil and gas or other parts of the energy industry, or recruiting directly from universities,\" Stilwell said. \"There’s a lot of competition out there.”Engineering and chemistry graduates working on a masters degrees in renewables at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya in Barcelona are often hired while they’re still in school, or right after they finish, according to Professor Jordi Llorca.The university has partnerships with other colleges in Europe and students often get hired to work in other countries like the UK or Denmark, said Llorca, who is also the director of an engineering research center at the university.\"We need to be fast to adapt the contents of our programs on the energy transition and renewable energies to make sure our graduates are competitive in the market,” Llorca said. \"We’re constantly looking at the contracts and agreements we have with different industries to see what's needed.”The university launched a masters in hydrogen energy last year after professors realised very few people have the skills in mechanics and chemistry that the fast-growing sector will need very soon. \"There’s always a moment of vacuum whenever a new technology comes in, but we’re able to put together new programs in just a few months.”Offshore wind farms are another growth area. The projects involve erecting and maintaining wind turbines the size of skyscrapers miles out to sea. A single turn of one of the massive blades could power a house for two days. The industry was pioneered in Europe, but is now rapidly expanding to Asia and the east coast of the US.Those new markets don’t have people with experience. That means that developers are often sending British and European employees to lead the way, according to Clint Harrison, director at renewable energy-focused recruitment firm Taylor Hopkinson. But as business takes off there’s pressure to hire locally.The limits of a well-trained workforce could end up being a bottleneck in an industry that is key to slashing emissions.\"There’s a sense of urgency,” Harrison said. \"The market is growing very, very quickly and we need to ensure we have the right people across various projects and regions to ensure projects move forward and aren’t delayed.”In the UK alone, around 200,000 skilled workers will be needed in the offshore energy sector by 2030, up from 160,000 today, according to a recent report by the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen.About half the jobs are expected to be filled by people transferring from the oil and gas sector and about 90% of current workers in the fossil-fuel sector can be retrained for renewables, said author Paul de Leeuw.\"Demand for courses on renewable energy and the energy transition is ramping up rapidly and at the same time we see demand for oil courses declining,” he said. \"It’s a societal and industry shift mirroring in the education system.” – Bloomberg\n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ohio asked a court on Tuesday to declare Alphabet's Google a public utility, a step the state's Republican attorney general said would forbid the search and advertising giant from giving preferential treatment to its own products.\"When you own the railroad or the electric company or the cellphone tower, you have to treat everyone the same and give everybody access,\" Attorney General Dave Yost said in a statement.The lawsuit, which estimates that Google is used for nearly 90% of internet searches and has 95% of the search share on mobile devices, accuses Google of responding to certain search requests in a way that prioritizes Google's products even if other responses would give better answers.\"Google uses its dominance of internet search to steer Ohioans to Google's own products - that's discriminatory and anti-competitive,\" Yost said.A Google spokesperson said the company would defend itself in court.\"Google Search is designed to provide people with the most relevant and helpful results. ... Ohioans simply don't want the government to run Google like a gas or electric company. This lawsuit has no basis in fact or law,\" the spokesperson's statement said.The lawsuit seeks no monetary damages but asks the court to require Google to refrain from prioritizing its own products. It alleges that nearly two-thirds of Google searches in 2020 were done without leaving Google's platform.\"It often features Google products and services in attractive formats at the top of the Results page above organic search results. Additionally, Google often presents Google products in enhanced ways in the search results that are designed to capture more clicks,\" the lawsuit states.The lawsuit was filed in the common pleas court, Delaware County, in Ohio.

      "Tesla Inc. has parted ways with Jerome Guillen, a 10-year veteran who most recently served as president of heavy trucking and was one of four top executives running the company alongside Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk.Guillen left the company June 3, according to a regulatory filing Monday. He was a top lieutenant to Musk and the brains behind the ramp up of Model 3 production in 2018. The executive previously served as president of Tesla’s automotive business, and was named head of heavy trucking in March of this year.\"That is a huge and unexpected loss,” Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research who has a buy recommendation on the Tesla shares, said in an email. He added the news is part of a pattern of high-level executive departures at the company. \"Jerome’s contribution to Tesla will remain part of the company and the company will continue to attract other top-guns.”Tesla fell as much as 0.8% in postmarket trading Monday after closing up 1% to US$605.13 (RM2,493.14). The stock is down about 14% this year.Guillen, who is French, joined Tesla in the fall of 2010 as the program director for the Model S, the breakthrough electric vehicle which laid the groundwork for the crossover Model X and more mass market Model 3 that followed. He was 48 years old as of Tesla’s latest annual report.Guillen didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Turnover StruggleTesla has struggled with executive turnover for years. Guillen took a several-months-long leave of absence from the company in 2015 but returned in 2016 to lead the company’s Semi truck program. He was promoted in 2018 to serve as the head of automotive operations.The executive is known for building an assembly line against all odds in a tent outside of Tesla’s auto plant in Fremont, California. The cobbled-together line was instrumental to the company finally delivering on the Model 3, a bet-the-company effort that nearly bankrupted Tesla in 2018.His sudden exit leaves Musk, Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn and Drew Baglino, a senior vice president in charge of powertrain and energy engineering, as the triumvirate atop the company, which has more than 70,000 employees globally.\"We thank him for his many contributions and wish him well in his future career,” the electric carmaker said in the filing.Guillen, who previously worked at Daimler AG, briefly appeared on stage when Tesla unveiled the Semi Truck in the fall of 2017. But initial production of the Semi has been delayed and is dependent on new, larger 4680 battery cells that Tesla is trying to make in-house and get from long-time suppliers like Japan’s Panasonic Corp.Musk said via a tweet Sunday that Tesla has canceled plans to build a longer range version of its Model S known as the Plaid +, a vehicle that also was supposed to use the new type of battery.Musk didn’t address whether the availability of the 4680 factored in Tesla’s decision to cancel the upscale version of the flagship sedan. Tesla will debut the standard Plaid model at an event scheduled to take place June 10. – Bloomberg\n",

      "Tech\n",
      "STEPHANIE KELLY，JESSICA RESNICK-AULT\n",
      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of Colonial Pipeline told U.S. senators on Tuesday that hackers who launched last month's cyber attack against the company and disrupted fuel supplies to the U.S. Southeast were able to get into the system by stealing a single password.Colonial Pipeline Chief Executive Joseph Blount told a U.S. Senate committee that the attack occurred using a legacy Virtual Private Network (VPN) system that did not have multifactor authentication in place. That means it could be accessed through a password without a second step such as a text message, a common security safeguard in more recent software.\"In the case of this particular legacy VPN, it only had single-factor authentication,\" Blount said. \"It was a complicated password, I want to be clear on that. It was not a Colonial123-type password.\"The panel was convened to examine threats to critical U.S. infrastructure and the Colonial attack, which shut key conduits delivering fuel from Gulf Coast refineries to major East Coast markets. Cyberattacks also hit U.S. meatpacking plants owned by JBS, showing the breadth of infrastructure facing cyber threats.The Colonial Pipeline hack demonstrated that much of the company's infrastructure remains highly vulnerable and the government and companies must work harder to prevent future hacks, senators said during the hearing.Security experts call the use of a single-factor login system a sign of poor cybersecurity \"hygiene.\" They recommend two-factor authentication, which requires a secondary measure like a mobile text or hardware token, and most major companies require this across all internal applications.Senators questioned Blount about the company's preparations and the timeline for responding to the ransomware attack, which shut the line for days and led to a spike in gasoline prices, panic buying and localized fuel shortages.\"I'm alarmed this breach ever occurred in the first place,\" said Senator Gary Peters, the committee's chairman. \"Make no mistake: if we do not step up our cyber security readiness, the consequences will be severe.\"The FBI attributed the hack to a gang called DarkSide. Some senators suggested Colonial had not sufficiently consulted with the U.S. government before paying the ransom against federal guidelines.Blount said he made the decision to pay ransom and to keep the payment as confidential as possible because of concern for security.\"It was our understanding that the decision was solely ours to make about whether to pay the ransom,\" he said.Blount said Colonial did not have a plan in place to prevent a ransomware attack, but did have an emergency response plan. The company notified the FBI within hours.Blount said Colonial has invested over $200 million over the last five years in its IT systems. When pressed to answer how much Colonial has spent to keep its pipeline cyber secure, Blount repeated that amount. A company spokesperson later clarified the $200 million was for IT overall, which includes cyber security.On Friday, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco urged companies to tell federal authorities whether they paid ransom to cyberattackers, information that can help investigators.Blount said even after getting the key from the hackers, the company is still recovering from the attack and is bringing back seven finance systems that have been offline since May 7.On Monday, the Justice Department said it had recovered some $2.3 million in cryptocurrency ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline.Colonial Pipeline previously had said it paid the hackers nearly $5 million to regain access. The value of the cryptocurrency bitcoin has dropped to below $35,000 in recent weeks after hitting a high of $63,000 in April.As a result, the government recovered about 60 of the 75 bitcoin paid, but the value has dropped, falling short of the total dollar amount Colonial paid.Bitcoin seizures are rare, but authorities have stepped up their expertise in tracking the flow of digital money as ransomware has become a growing national security threat and put a further strain on relations between the United States and Russia, where many of the gangs are based.\n",

      "(Reuters) - Thousands of government, news and social media websites across the globe were coming back online on Tuesday after getting hit by a widespread hour-long outage linked to U.S.-based cloud company Fastly Inc.High-traffic sites including Reddit, Amazon, CNN, PayPal, Spotify, Al Jazeera Media Network and the New York Times went down, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. They came back after outages that ranged from a few minutes to around an hour early in the morning in the United States but middle of the day in Europe.\"Our global network is coming back online,\" Fastly said.One of the world's most widely-used cloud-based content delivery network providers, the company earlier reported a disruption from a \"service configuration\" and did not explain.\"Incidents like this underline the fragility of the internet and its dependence on a patchwork of fragmented technology. Ironically, this also underlines its inherent strength and how quickly it can recover,\" Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, said.\"The fact that an outage like this can grab headlines around the world shows how rare it is.\"Typical service configurations for a cloud service provider can include updating security rules to protect information, or instructing a server to refresh the contents of a news site before serving it to a customer, said Andy Champagne, senior vice president at Akamai, a cloud service company.A simple typo can be propagated to thousands of servers and cause disruptions, he said.Fastly, which went public in 2019 and has a market capitalization of under $6 billion, is far smaller than peers like Amazon's AWS. The company's content delivery network (CDN) helps websites move content using less-congested routes, enabling them to reach consumers faster.\"In the grand scheme of things, we actually think that this is a little bit of a positive for other CDNs and also just shows how difficult managing a CDN can be,\" said James Fish, analyst at Piper Sandler & Co.Apart from Fastly, the other main CDN providers include Akamai Technologies, Cloudera and AWS.\"It certainly reminds us just how crucial so few sites and services are to our digital lives,\" said Neil Campling, global TMT analyst at Mirabaud Securities.Users received error messages quickly when they visited affected websites on Tuesday, which is an indication Fastly was not a victim of a DDoS attack, or a type of cyber-attack in which a bad actor overwhelms a network with a flood of internet traffic, Champagne said.The United Kingdom's attorney general earlier tweeted that the country's main gov.uk website was down, providing an email for queries.The disruption may have caused issues for citizens booking COVID-19 vaccinations or reporting test results, the Financial Times reported.Websites operated by news outlets including the Financial Times, the Guardian and Bloomberg News also faced outages.Many of the websites affected earn revenue from digital advertising. Worldwide, websites lost over $29 million in digital ad revenue per hour during the outage, according to back-of-the-envelope estimates from media measurement firm Kantar.News publishers came up with inventive workarounds to report about the outage when their websites failed to load.Popular tech website the Verge used Google Docs to report news, while UK Technology Editor at the Guardian started a Twitter thread to report on the problems.At the onset of the outage, nearly 21,000 Reddit users reported issues with the social media platform, while more than 2,000 users reported problems with Amazon, according to Downdetector.com.Twitter users quickly reacted to the outage, creating the #InternetShutdown hashtag with KITKAT's official handle telling its 441,500 followers \"Guess it's time to Have A Break.\"\"We were offline for a few minutes because the whole internet broke down,\" tweeted Jitse Groen, chief executive of food delivery group Just Eat Takeaway.com.Shares of New York-listed Fastly were up 7.7% after being down nearly 4% in pre-market trading.(Reporting by Subrat Patnaik, Noor Zainab Hussain, Chavi Mehta and Shubham Kalia in Bengaluru, Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm, and Sheila Dang in Dallas; Editing by Patrick Graham, Bernard Orr, Chris Reese and Nick Zieminski)\n",

By mid-December it was worth around 550 million pounds ($745 million).\"Long term, we remain interested in digital assets and the role they can play in real wealth preservation,\" the spokesperson said. \"In the short term, following the sharp increase in the bitcoin price, we felt bitcoin was exhibiting more risk.\"Ruffer's bitcoin profit was first reported by The Sunday Times.Meanwhile, MicroStrategy Inc, a major bitcoin corporate backer, has increased the size of a junk-bond sale to help buy more bitcoin, now targeting $500 million, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.Bitcoin was last trading at $32,055.20, down 4.5% on the day.

      "The returns from Bitcoin this year are sliding below traditional assets as cryptocurrencies struggle to claw back ground lost in a rout in May.The largest token tumbled almost 6% at one point in Asian trading Tuesday and was at a two-week low of about US$33,000 (RM135,980) as of 1:07pm in Hong Kong. The wider Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index fell as much as 10%.Bitcoin is still up 14% this year but that trails commodities as well as some European and Asian share gauges. The proximal cause of Tuesday’s weakness was unclear — one theory was that the recovery of a high-profile Bitcoin ransom by the US showed the token isn’t beyond official control to the extent claimed by its biggest proponents.The fact that investigators \"could trace the untraceable and seize it might be undermining the libertarian, free-of-government-control case,” said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda. The implications of that may have provoked the selling, he said.The US recovered almost all the Bitcoin ransom paid to the perpetrators of the cyber attack on Colonial Pipeline Co. last month in a sign that law enforcement is capable of pursuing online criminals even when they operate outside the nation’s borders.Strategists such as Halley and Evercore ISI’s Rich Ross are watching key technical levels for Bitcoin. Halley said a break below US$30,000 (RM123,615) could lead to \"another capitulation.” Ross sees a test of support around US$29,000 (RM119,494.50)Bitcoin has plunged from a peak of almost $65,000 (RM267,832.50) in mid-April, casting a pall over the cryptocurrency sector. The selloff was exacerbated by billionaire Elon Musk’s public rebuke of the amount of energy used by the servers underpinning the token. Harsh Chinese regulatory oversight also soured the mood.The virtual currency — which has more than tripled over the past year — is now in a \"cooling off period” that could last \"a few months” longer, said Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia-Pacific at crypto exchange Luno Pte. – Bloomberg\n",

      "On June 6, Floyd Mayweather, once regarded as the best pound-for-pound fighter in boxing, will step into the ring at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, for a much-anticipated exhibition showdown that will air live on Showtime pay-per-view for US$49.99 (RM206). Mayweather’s opponent will be someone who spent his formative years training for combat in what is perhaps the bloodiest, dirtiest and most-harrowing realm of contemporary, gladiatorial life - namely, the alligator pits of social media.Mayweather will be fighting Logan Paul, former champion of the YouTube world.Paul, 26, is a boxing newbie. And yet seemingly overnight, in the wake of several bruising, social-media scandals that left his reputation in tatters, the scrappy, blond brawler has emerged as one of the top attractions in boxing, selling out arenas, racking up millions in pay-per-view sales and igniting a passion for the sweet science among a young demographic of fans who until recently couldn’t care less. \"It will be one of the most viewed events of the year, if not boxing history,” said Jeff Levin, his manager.At a time when the alchemy of cultural cancellation is under intense study, Paul’s sudden transformation from reviled Internet dude to must-see athlete is shaping up to be a draw of its own. Levin suggested his client’s metamorphosis is more reasonable than one might think. \"Logan is all about entertainment,” said Levin. \"He’s wanted to be the biggest entertainer. Sports is another form of entertainment for him. It’s very calculated.”Not to mention, very lucrative. Social media made Paul famous. Boxing is making him rich.Paul is now making more money from boxing than he ever made from hawking brands as a social-media influencer. The same goes for his younger brother Jake Paul, who has followed a similar career path from social-media provocateur to crowd-pleasing boxer and recently signed a deal for a future fight on Showtime. If the numbers they tout publicly are even remotely accurate – there is a long history of exaggeration in boxing – they are raking in millions of dollars per fight. Their time in the ring is also fuelling other parts of their business. Logan’s merchandise line generated US$40mil (RM165mil) in sales during its first nine months.\"I make way more from boxing, and that’s been the case for a while now,” Jake said during an interview from Puerto Rico, where he and his brother now live.Before his descent into social-media infamy, Logan first rose to fame on Vine, a short-form video app where he posted goofy scenes of himself jumping over oncoming traffic, stripping into his wrestling uniform in a supermarket and breaking through a wall in his home to open Christmas presents. In 2015, Logan was named one of its most influential figures.When Vine imploded, Logan branched out to other platforms. Over time, he ascended to global stardom on YouTube thanks to his frequently posted videos, which tended to be short, sophomoric and wildly popular. Eventually, traditional media took note and came calling. Logan appeared on TV shows such as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and landed several major endorsement deals.Around the same time that YouTube began to focus on courting top advertisers, his antics started to become a problem. On New Year’s Eve in 2017, Logan uploaded a video to his YouTube channel showing a corpse hanging from a tree in Aokigahara, a forest in Japan that’s notorious for frequent suicides. None of which stopped Logan, then 22, from cracking some jokes at the victim’s expense.Celebrities, politicians and fellow YouTubers lambasted him for his insensitivity, and several petitions on Change.org called for YouTube to punish the star. YouTube gave Logan a slap on the wrist, removing his 15-million-plus-subscriber channel from Google Preferred, its program for premium advertising, and cancelling plans for a movie that would have cast Logan in a starring role.In the months that followed, he made matters worse by posting a video in which he tased two dead rats. YouTube suspended all advertising from his channel. Once billed as the next big thing, Logan suddenly appeared to be the latest Internet celebrity to burn brightly only to fizzle out fast.\"We did have the down years after the Japan incident,” said his manager, who chalked up the events to Logan’s youth, naivete and fame. \"Everybody has issues. His just were front and centre to the whole world. And recorded.”Not long after the Internet deemed Logan to be the ultimate YouTube villain, he turned his attention to boxing, a sport that, not coincidentally, has always embraced villainous characters (see Tyson, Mike). Before long, he accepted a challenge to fight a British YouTuber named KSI. Logan had never boxed before, but he had wrestled in high school.In the end, about 21,000 people bought tickets to the fight in Manchester Arena, which was billed as the \"the biggest Internet event in history.” While the quality of the boxing didn’t bring back memories of Muhammad Ali versus Joe Frazier, people ate it up anyway. More than 1 million people paid to watch the fight live on YouTube, and many more pirated it online.Initially, some boxing fans dismissed Logan as a sideshow, an amateur narcissist giving the sport a bad name. When he approached Showtime about airing his rematch with KSI, the network turned him down. \"There is a backlash among the purists and traditional boxing fans,” said Stephen Espinoza, the head of Showtime Sports. \"I’d say there probably was a least some initial feeling of that in myself and perhaps some of my colleagues.”One of the first mainstream sports companies to grasp the potential was DAZN, which signed on to stream the rematch in November 2019 at Staples Center in Los Angeles. Unlike the first fight, which was an amateur event, this one marked Logan’s debut - and first loss - as a professional fighter. The bout turned out to be one of DAZN’s most popular events of the year.When it came time for Logan’s next appearance in the ring, DAZN somehow lost out to Triller, a short-form video app. Triller looked to Logan and his brother as the cornerstones of a new pay-per-view fight package and the key to luring more social-media influencers to join the platform. Again and again, the brothers’ fights turned into major successes.The duo’s sophomoric on-screen personas belie their strong work ethic. They have trained for months before every fight, combining jogging, shadow boxing, sprinting, yoga, high-intensity workouts and ice baths. Last year, they moved to Puerto Rico where they have set up a boxing training camp and sparred with some of the island’s top fighters.When it comes to showmanship, the Pauls evoke World Wrestling Entertainment more than contemporary boxing. They will only fight people with large social-media followings, and they treat each event as an entertainment spectacle - not just a boxing match. Pop star Justin Bieber walked Logan to the ring for his bout against KSI and later performed at Jake’s fight against mixed martial artist Ben Askren. During Jake’s most recent fight, rapper Snoop Dogg provided commentary.Along the way, the Pauls have used the tools they developed as entertainers on Vine, YouTube, Instagram and Facebook to bring attention to the events and to cater to their most ardent fans: the 14-to-28-year-old guys who love fighting and trolling. These boys, young men and man-children will buy their T-shirts and pay to watch their boxing matches. They might even pay to watch a Paul sumo wrestle or eat Jell-O.\"The star-making machinery and apparatus has been taken out of the hands of corporations and put in the hands of self-made entrepreneurs,” said Showtime’s Espinoza.The more that right-minded social critics disapprove of the Paul brothers, the move their stock rises in the ring. Such is the life of an Internet heel. Saying irritating things or acting like a buffoon is simply smart business, good for the bottom line. \"It’s all a game, ” Jake said. \"It’s show business. There’s a way to play it.” – Bloomberg\n",

      "The marketplace Etsy has just ponied up US$1.6bil to buy Depop, the British application specialised in second-hand clothes, which has become an essential app among Gen Z.This generation is drawn to second-hand clothing for its budget-friendly prices, but also because it corresponds to their concerns and commitments in terms of the environment, as Florence de Ferran, a professor and researcher in management sciences at the University of La Rochelle, explains.Why are consumers turning to second-hand on a massive scale?I wouldn’t say they’re turning to second-hand on a massive scale. There are indeed several variables that have facilitated the growth of certain types of second-hand commerce.Vinted, for example, is a site that people have been talking a lot about lately.But second-hand is much broader than that. It’s not just on apps or websites. It has existed for a long time through flea markets or other places where people buy second-hand products.It has simply evolved over the last 15 years, especially with the sociological demographic referred to as hipsters, looking for vintage products. This enthusiasm for second-hand goods is not new.For the last two or three years, another demographic, namely young people, have seized on this type of consumption because of environmental concerns.There has been an evolution, because they are now buying second-hand clothes and other products for two reasons: it’s smart from a budgetary point of view, and it’s better for the planet. It’s a different approach.They don’t go to flea markets; for them it’s more about using apps and websites to buy these second-hand products. These days it’s become emblematic for clothing and for everything that is electronic equipment.What are the main reasons for consumers choosing to buy second-hand?The budgetary aspect, i.e., saving money, takes prominence over all else.Most young people buy second-hand because it’s a good deal, because it’s affordable, because they don’t see the point of paying 20% more for a new garment. The financial aspect clearly comes into play.But others also do it because it addresses their environmental concerns. It’s quite a major trend among the younger generations.Is buying fast fashion on second-hand e-commerce sites really better for the environment?Every individual, whoever they are, has their own contradictions. Oftentimes — and probably even more frequently when we are young — we don’t necessarily think about all the implications of our behaviour and we often stop at rather basic rationalisations.I don’t know if this generation really buys fast fashion on second-hand websites, but in any case, there are indeed questions that they aren’t asking themselves.They aren’t necessarily asking themselves, for example, about the fact that buying on Vinted implies a series of logistics, sometimes for just one item of clothing; which is extremely polluting compared to a store where logistics are pooled for many items.Doesn’t this type of second-hand purchasing encourage over-consumption?It depends, there are several cases. If you have low purchasing power, I’m not sure that you will end up buying more.But there is also the idea of buying to resell, so there is a circular process that makes you spend and earn at the same time. The result is that a person can indeed buy at their leisure.But I feel like it’s a phenomenon that’s fairly short-lived, because it takes work and long-term investment. I think it’s something that may be done compulsively but over a period of time that is relatively limited. It is a specific type of behaviour, however, which does not affect all consumers.In recent months, there’s been much talk in the fashion world about second-hand, but also about upcycling, renting clothes, or “returnable” garments. What is the best choice to reduce the sector’s impact on the environment?This is an extremely large question, because we must first ask ourselves if it is a question of reducing our pollution on the environment, or a dimension of our pollution that is the carbon footprint.We must answer this question in order to know which axis it’s possible to take action with. We must then investigate each of the areas of our consumption and arbitrate according to those that are the most costly compared to others.If we want to limit our carbon footprint, which is the most talked-about indicator today, we have to focus our attention on transportation because it is the most polluting for an average consumer.In this case, it is therefore a question of reducing our use of transports, but also of reducing the amount of transportation used by the goods we buy: consume locally, favour the train for travelling over the plane, etc. This is the first aspect which we can adjust to reduce this carbon footprint.Will clothing that is responsibly sourced, ethical and sustainable ever be accessible to a majority of people?Consumption is totally unequal right now. Consumer choices vary greatly according to purchasing power, that’s obvious. It is possible to have access to a small quantity of responsible consumer choices when it comes to food even on a tight budget, but on processed products, such as textiles, it is clearly more complicated and not very accessible.There is, however, one thing in our society that we have lost sight of: and that is knowing what a price really represents.For a long time, we believed that good quality products at low prices could exist, but this is false because there is always an actor in the production chain who pays the price.In reality, if you want a responsible product, or one with a social or environmental quality, it necessarily comes at a certain price. While it may be a fair price, some people will think that it’s expensive.Except that we, as consumers, have forgotten what a fair price is, because we have been used to a consumer society where everything was accessible without worrying about these values. Of course this creates frustration now for some people who do not have the means to have access to these kinds of products.Do you think it’s possible to envision second-hand stores one day replacing traditional stores?It’s not at all in the realm of the impossible. I think that if Vinted opened a store in Paris, it would definitely work. What is certain is that the circular economy is becoming more and more widespread, and that things will develop around these concepts.This interview has been translated from French.\n",

      "Disinformation campaigns are becoming increasingly frequent on social networks, especially in the run-up to elections. Such campaigns are capable of manipulating opinion, reinforcing conspiracy theories or even swaying elections.To counter this new danger, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) researchers have designed an artificial intelligence system capable of identifying fake news with great accuracy.In an effort to fight online disinformation and clean up the internet, a team of MIT researchers have launched a program called \"Reconnaissance of Influence Operations (RIO).\" Their aim was to create a system capable of automatically detecting disinformation and the accounts that spread it. Its success rate is around 96%.The project first originated in 2014, when the team was studying how social media could be exploited by malicious groups. As part of their work, the researchers noticed increased and unusual activity from accounts that appeared to be driving pro-Russian stories. As a result, the team decided to launch the program to study what kind of similar techniques might be used on social media during the 2017 French presidential elections.In the 30 days leading up to the vote, the team compiled 28 million posts from more than one million accounts relating to the election. For example, the study detected a large rate of hostile accounts spreading fake news around the #macronleaks narrative.The team of researchers also looked at the impact of disinformation messages. Using the RIO program, they were able to find out whether an account was contributing to the spread of fake news and what impact this had on the wider network. RIO also has the ability to help predict how different countermeasures might stop the spread of a given disinformation campaign.Hostile online influence operationsEdward Kao, a member of the research team, told MIT News: \"If you are trying to answer the question of who is influential on a social network, traditionally, people look at activity counts. What we found is that, in many cases this is not sufficient. It doesn't actually tell you the impact of the accounts on the social network.\"To address this, Kao developed a statistical approach (as outlined in the study) to help determine whether an account is spreading disinformation and the extent to which the account causes the network, as a whole, to change and amplify the message.The RIO system collects relevant data then identifies potential influence operation narratives, and classifies accounts based on their behavior and content. It then builds a narrative network to estimate the impact of these accounts on spreading specific narratives across social media.These hostile online influence operations, as described in the study, are facilitated by the relatively low cost, unbridled scalability and automation of a certain number of variables in the spread of disinformation on social media. It remains to be seen if and how this system can be implemented in order to control the spread of fake news. – AFP/Relaxnews\n",

      "BERLIN (Reuters) -Robert Bosch opened a 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) chip plant in Germany on Monday, a record investment by the leading automotive supplier as it stakes a claim to equipping the latest electric and self-driving cars.The plant, located in a semiconductor hub near Dresden, opens as the automotive industry battles a global chip shortage, and will increase Bosch's ability to serve carmakers directly, relying less on third-party manufacturers.\"Every chip that we make here in Dresden is one chip less that is lacking. That helps,\" management board member Harald Kroeger told Reuters in an interview.Addressing an online opening ceremony, Chancellor Angela Merkel said semiconductor shortages were hampering Germany's economic recovery, and that it was important to strengthen resilience against external supply disruptions.\"We aren't in pole position - we have to catch up,\" Merkel said. \"We must be ambitious. Our competitors around the world aren't sleeping.\"The Bosch plant will make specialist power-management chips and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) that are designed to carry out a single task, such as triggering a car's automatic braking system.It will not however address shortages of products like microcontrollers which have forced auto makers to halt production and are expected by industry leaders and analysts to extend into next year.\"The fab (chip fabrication plant) may help to insulate Bosch and its key customers somewhat,\" said Asif Anwar at Strategy Analytics. \"But it is unlikely to serve as a gap filler to the current shortages being experienced in the automotive market.\"The Bosch plant, which received 200 million euros ($243 million) in state aid under a European Union investment scheme, will start making chips for power tools in July, with output of automotive chips to follow from September.\"The state-of-the-art technology in Bosch's new semiconductor factory in Dresden shows what outstanding results can be achieved when industry and government join forces,\" said European Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager.Kroeger said Bosch supported a broader strategic push by Brussels to revive Europe's semiconductor industry.

      "BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Google has bowed to pressure from rivals and will let them compete for free to be the default search engines on Android devices in Europe, widening a pledge to EU antitrust regulators two years ago.The move by the world's most popular internet search engine comes as the 27-country bloc considers rules that could be introduced next year to force Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook to ensure a level playing field for competitors.Google's Android mobile operating system runs on about four-fifths of the world's smartphones. The U.S. tech giant said in 2019 that rivals would have to pay via an auction for appearing on a choice screen on new Android devices in Europe from which users select their preferred search engine.Google's change of heart followed a 4.24 billion euro ($5.16 billion) fine handed out by the European Commission, the EU antitrust authority, in 2018 for unfairly using Android to cement the dominance of its search engine.\"We are now making some final changes to the Choice Screen including making participation free for eligible search providers. We will also be increasing the number of search providers shown on the screen,\" Google director Oliver Bethell wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.The changes will come into effect in September, the blog added.The Commission said it had discussed possible changes with Google following concerns raised by a number of its rivals, adding that those announced were positive developments.Google said the five most popular eligible search engines in each EU country according to StatCounter, including Google, would be displayed in random order at the top of the screen while up to seven will be shown at the bottom.It had previously only allowed four competitors, chosen in separate auctions for each EU country, to be displayed on Android screens.However DuckDuckGo, a rival search engine that has long complained about the auction process, said Google should go further.\"Google is now doing what it should have done three years ago: a free search preference menu on Android in the EU,\" CEO Gabriel Weinberg tweeted.\"However, it should be on all platforms, eg also desktop Chrome, accessible at all times, ie not just on factory reset, and in all countries.\"Search engine Ecosia, which together with four other rivals complained about Google's initial proposal to the Commission last year, welcomed the changes.\"With this, we have something that resembles a level playing field in the market,\" its CEO Christian Kroll said in a statement.\"Search providers now have a chance to compete more fairly in the Android market, based on the appeal of their product, rather than being shut out by monopolistic behaviour.\"($1 = 0.8211 euros)(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Pravin Char and Jan Harvey)\n",

The proposed change would start in 2023.Rettig has said that massive profits from the run-up in crypto asset valuations are escaping the IRS, contributing to a \"tax gap\" that he estimates at some $1 trillion a year - the difference between taxes legally owed and those collected.The Treasury also has proposed that the cash transfer reporting limit be reduced to $600 from the current $10,000, which Republican Senator Mike Crapo criticized as causing \"a significant amount of privacy concerns.\"Rettig said he did not advocate for the proposal, but said that along with modernized computer systems, would help the IRS determine which taxpayers not to target for audits, as the agency wants to concentrate on higher-wealth individuals who are more prone to tax evasion.DATA BREACH PROBERegarding a report https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax by news outlet ProPublica analyzing what it called a \"vast trove of Internal Revenue Service data\" on the taxes of some of the wealthiest Americans, Rettig said an investigation into any potential disclosure breach was underway.\"I can't speak to anything with respect to specific taxpayers.

That would make the upstart bank worth just slightly less than Banco Santander Brasil SA, Brazil's No. 3 bank, which has more than 2,000 branches.Nubank, which has 40 million clients, said in a statement it plans to use the proceeds to fund its international expansion to Mexico and Colombia, launch new products and services and hire more employees.The arrival of such high-profile investors, who usually invest in publicly traded companies, gives a hint on how close Nubank is to a listing.Earlier in April, Reuters reported that Nubank had initiated preparations for a U.S. stock market listing which could come as early as this year, according to sources familiar with the matter.BERKSHIRE BETS IN BRAZILNubank is Warren Buffett's second bet on a Brazilian financial startup. His Berkshire Hathaway also acquired a stake in payments company StoneCo Ltd almost three years ago, when it went public.A highly concentrated financial market dominated by five banks, Brazil has been a hotbed for fintech growth. Online banking has reduced costs for newcomers and the central bank has created new rules to encourage competition, aiming at lower fees and interest rates for consumers.Nubank's $750 million new funding round is part of its series G fundraising round, which totaled $1.15 billion. An initial part of the series G round was announced in January.Other participants in the round included Sands Capital, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, MSA Capital, Advent's Sunley House Capital and Brazilian asset managers Verde Asset Management and Absoluto Partners.(Reporting by Carolina Mandl, additional reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru and Carolina Mandl in Sao Paulo; Editing by Maju Samuel, Christian Plumb and Jonathan Oatis)\n",

      "PARIS (Reuters) - G7 states have found a way to include Amazon, one of the world's biggest companies, on a list of 100 set to face higher taxes in the countries where they do business by targeting its more profitable cloud computing unit, officials close to the talks said.Some European countries had concerns that Amazon may fall out of scope of the proposed new rules because its overall operating margin as a company is less than 10%, which is the threshold set as a criteria for companies on the list.But because its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has a margin of more than 30%, Amazon as a whole can be included, the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.International talks on a global minimum corporate tax which was agreed by the Group of Seven rich countries on June 5. are running in parallel to of talks on how to divide the rights to tax excess profits, those which can be considered routine, of the world's 100 biggest, most profitable companies.G7 finance ministers agreed that governments should get the right to tax at least 20% of profit earned in their country by a multinational, when this profit was over a 10% margin.\"We now decided that if a corporation as a whole does not reach the profitability limit, but a large division of it exceeds the G7 thresholds, it must be included,\" a source close to the discussions said.\"With this, we're aiming exactly at Amazon,\" the source added.Amazon did not immediately respond to requests to comment.Without singling out Amazon, a British government source familiar with the negotiations said consideration was being given to how the rules would apply to companies that had different activities and business lines.OECD head of tax Pascal Saint-Amans said that Amazon's AWS unit would be liable because it had revenues exceeding a threshold of 20 billion euros ($24.4 billion).\"The profits linked to the cloud (business) will thus be shared among countries,\" he told France Info television.($1 = 0.8214 euros)(Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Additional reporting by David Milliken in London; Editing by Alexander Smith)\n",

      "(Reuters) - Long-time Tesla Inc executive Jerome Guillen, who oversaw its Semi electric trucks slated to be launched this year, has left the company, Tesla said on Monday, barely three months after taking over the role.Guillen, who has been with the company for over a decade since starting as a Model S program director in 2010, oversaw Tesla's entire vehicles business before being named president of the Tesla Heavy Trucking unit in March. He was one of Tesla's top four leadership members, including CEO Elon Musk.Dan Levy, a Credit-Suisse analyst said in a note the departure is \"negative given Guillen previously viewed as central to Tesla\" as he was \"arguably key in stabilizing auto biz post Model 3 launch\" in 2017.Tesla is yet to begin delivering its battery-powered Semi electric commercial truck, with Musk saying in recent months that battery cell supply constraints could delay its mass production to 2022.Musk also said in January that Tesla would be able to produce the Semi when its new 4680 cells could be produced in volume, alleviating a battery shortage.Separately, Musk said on Sunday that Tesla has canceled its longest-range Model S Plaid+, which would use 4680 cells and whose production had been delayed to next year.\"They made a big deal about 4680 ... we are just upset the first (car with) 4680 apparently was abruptly canceled. This just raises more questions that they need to address,\" Louis Navellier, chief investment officer at Navellier, said.Tesla shares fell 0.7% in after market trading.Guillen was one of only a few long-serving executives at Tesla, which is known for the high turnover rate of its executives.RJ Johnson, who headed Tesla's Energy operations to sell solar and energy storage products, left the company after less than two years, according to his LinkedIn profile.

      "While the podcast market has been booming for over a year, the pandemic has driven many listeners to embrace this kind of audio content.This new appetite for podcasts is particularly good news for advertisers, as their ads appear to be better perceived in podcasts than in other media formats. From the entertaining to the educational, and from the liberated to the activist, podcasts are drawing more and more listeners around the world.Screen-related eye strain has a lot to do with it, according to a new study of more than 3,000 Americans conducted by Spotify and MAGNA. More than 70% of those surveyed said that they experienced screen fatigue during the pandemic.This is something they are fighting against with podcasts. Four out of ten listeners even cited screen fatigue as the primary reason they are listening to more digital audio content.For Gen Zers, podcasts are above all a new way to connect with others during the pandemic. Baby Boomers, however, see them primarily as a way to de-stress. \"There's no doubt the pandemic changed consumption habits and we're clearly seeing audio and podcast listening are extremely popular right now,\" said Kara Manatt, SVP, Intelligence Solutions, MAGNA.A new El Dorado for advertising?The study also revealed that podcast listeners are particularly devoted to the shows they listen to regularly. In fact, 60% of listeners listen to a new episode of their favorite podcast within a day, and 26% within a week. In comparison, 58% of TV viewers watch a new episode of their favorite TV show in the 24 hours following its broadcast.Relistening to podcasts is also becoming increasingly common, mirroring how users often rewatch favorite TV shows. And listener fidelity for podcasts is of keen interest to advertisers, who see an opportunity to revitalize the advertising sector.And rightly so, according to the figures. In the Spotify and MAGNA survey, 43% of respondents said that they're receptive to podcast ads, compared to just 17% who reported being receptive to TV ads. Podcast hosts appear to play a key role in this phenomenon, since the majority of listeners surveyed (84%) trust in the recommendations that they make.\"We found it particularly interesting that people are more receptive to ads on audio. Brands should ensure they are leveraging more audio and podcasting to keep up with consumption trends and consider targeting based on moods given the impact positive moods have on listening patterns,\" concludes Kara Manatt. — AFP/Relaxnews\n",

      "Want to be a star on TikTok? Well you're in luck as the Chinese application has already thought of everything you might need.Secrets, tips and explanations of how it all works... TikTok has unveiled six rules to follow to maximize your chances of getting your big break on the platform. With this little guide, aspiring TikTokers should no longer be intimidated to take the plunge.Whether you are an emerging creator or a young entrepreneur, TikTok can be a valuable tool to help you grow your presence on social. However, the ins and outs of Generation Z's new favorite platform remain a mystery for many internet users who are used to older social networks like Instagram and Twitter.As the Chinese app continues to expand its services in order to attract an increasing number of creators to its platform, it is continuing its pedagogical program by unveiling \"Behind the Camera,\" a two-part series that offers users a look at the keys to succeeding on TikTok, particularly for small-scale sellers.\"We are pleased to announce 'Behind The Camera,' a series of easy-to-follow instructional videos showing businesses how to take their TikTok to the next level with the latest creative trends and techniques,\" says the TikTok For Business blog.So if you want to become a Tiktok \"star,\" here are six essential rules to follow to stand out.1. Keep it simple, don't make it complicated!There is no need to complicate things, according to the Chinese platform. A good TikTok post has simplicity at its core in successfully conveying a message and having it understood.Avoid making the mistake of giving too much information at once. If in doubt, scale back the content of your video to one or two pieces of information so as not to lose your followers, even if it means making several TikTok videos in a row to support your point.2. Shoot verticallyOne of TikTok's advantages resides in its full-screen format. To take advantage of this interface, the platform advises users to film vertically and not horizontally in order to offer a better experience to its subscribers. Indeed, it's rare to see horizontally shot TikTok content since the user swipes up and down on the application.3. Get out your ring lightLights! This is one of the most valuable tips when it comes to winning over followers. While a video can last up to 60 seconds, it's within the first few seconds that a user quickly decides whether to move on to another video or to watch yours.Good lighting is an absolute must in order to make your TikTok appealing as possible. Playing with different lighting can also give your video a boost and make its content clear so that the viewer doesn't get bored.4. Focus on the subject!Image quality is very important on the platform. TikTok users pay a lot of attention to the focus of their videos. While this may seem like an obvious tip, it is still very important: make sure you keep the lens focused on the subject, object or thing you want your audience to pay attention to. A blurry video or a subject that gets lost in overly dark lighting due to lack of focus will drive customers away.5. Use effects and text...to boost your chances with the algorithmTikTok loves it when you use its effects and text treatment options on videos. An undeniable advantage since the platform pushes these kinds of videos on the famous \"For You Page.\" And TikTok isn't hiding the fact that \"TikTok has created hundreds of effects and text treatment options for you to use in your TikToks. These native features help keep your content feeling native to the platform which can also help get it to more For You pages!\"6. Have fun - and post often!It's not surprising that the platform emphasises this aspect. Having fun is essential, and TikTok wants users to remember to focus on positive experiences, although the platform has come under criticism for a lack of moderation.A positive vibe is highly sought after on the Chinese application whose motivational content is often highly watched and liked. That said, a smile is not enough, it's important to publish frequently!Many creators have stressed the importance of posting several times a day in order to attract the attention of the algorithm. And don't forget to interact with your followers, a given for any community platform. – AFP/Relaxnews\n",

      "(Reuters) - Brinqa, a startup that helps businesses map out their cybersecurity applications and alert them of gaps, on Tuesday said it raised $110 million from private equity firm Insight Partners.Cybersecurity companies have been getting big rounds of funding as remote work and the mounting numbers of digital gadgets increase the opportunities for hackers to break in.For Austin, Texas based Brinqa, founded in 2009, this is the first institutional investment, with the company self-funded until now, said CEO Amad Fida. He declined to share how much the company was valued at, adding only that Insight Partners received a minority stake.“A large enterprise would have upwards of 50 to 60 systems feeding data into Brinqa. And then Brinqa, it looks at that knowledge, combs it, or correlates it, makes some sense out of it and identifies things that are high risk, medium risk, low risk,” said Fida. The company can then be alerted automatically of any security gaps and in some cases the Brinqa software can change setting on applications to close those gaps, he said.The shortage of cybersecurity talent makes software that can automate a large part of the security work increasingly important, say cybersecurity industry executives.\n",

      "TAIPEI (Reuters) -It is still too early to say whether the major chip companies that operate in Taiwan's tech hub of Hsinchu will be safe from the latest increase in COVID-19 infections, its mayor said, though chip giant TSMC said it had seen no impact so far.After months of relative safety, Taiwan is dealing with a rise in domestic infections, which have since last week begun impacting a small number of tech firms in Miaoli, the town adjacent to Hsinchu, including chip test and packaging firm King Yuan Electronics and semiconductor equipment provider Foxsemicon Integrated Technology.Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors and is central to global efforts to resolve a chip shortage that has shuttered some car plants around the world and is now starting to affect consumer electronics.Hsinchu, home to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip maker, has set up an \"anti-epidemic combat alliance\" with Miaoli to ensure infections do not spread.President Tsai Ing-wen has vowed to build a \"line of defence\" to protect what she called an \"industry of national importance,\" sending soldiers last week to help build test stations in Hsinchu Science Park.Hsinchu Mayor Lin Chih-chien, in an interview with Reuters late on Monday, said that he could not guarantee total safety for the city's tech firms, but that the government had rolled out rapid testing stations.\"I don't dare to say there is absolutely no problem. If there were no problem, then we wouldn't need to set up rapid testing stations in the science park so urgently and quickly,\" said Lin, a member of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.On Sunday he said they had tested more than 1,800 migrant workers and found five positive cases.He said it was \"too early to say\" whether the city's tech firms were totally safe.Hsinchu's science park is home to more than 10,000 migrant workers, with almost 68,000 in the city, its neighbouring county and Miaoli, with some dormitories housing more than 10 people per room, creating a possible \"hotbed\" for transmission, Lin said.TSMC SEES NO IMPACTSo far the pandemic has not had a major impact on TSMC, which last month began stepped up disease-prevention measures, including separating work teams and telling staff and vendors not to move across its main production sites in Hsinchu, Taichung and Tainan.TSMC said in a statement the company had not started mass testing of employees.\"Regarding the rise in infections in Miaoli, we have not seen any impact so far, and we are monitoring the situation closely,\" the company said.By Tuesday morning, more than 250 cases had been reported in four tech companies in the area, the majority of which were in migrant workers from Southeast Asian countries.Companies affected included chip packaging and testing firm Greatek Electronics Inc and telecom equipment maker Accton Technology Corp.In a statement to the stock exchange on Monday, King Yuan, which has recorded more than 200 infections, said it expected a 30%-35% impact on production in June.(Reporting by Roger Tung; Writing by Ben Blanchard and Yimou Lee.

      "Researchers have developed a framework capable of creating Android applications from textual descriptions. Could it be a game-changer when it comes to app creation?In some ways it’s nothing short of a mini revolution. Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) have succeeded in developing a framework that can create an application on Android from text. They trained a translation model to generate representations in an intermediate language they created.This method is different from other existing techniques that use raw code. The latter are based on neural machine translation, similar to that used by Google Translate, and “translate” human language into source code. While these methods work, they are unable to create larger programs with hundreds of lines of code. This is what motivated the researchers to create a new language that would capture the complexity of source code by representing it in textual form.“Our research group at the Department of CSE, BUET works on bridging the gap between human language and programming language to make computer programming more accessible,” Masum Hasan, one of the researchers who worked on the study, told TechXplore.“We designed an intermediate formal language...We then developed a compiler that can convert the compact representation into actual source code and trained a neural machine translation model to translate natural language to this intermediate format, which can then be compiled into an app.”Text2App, an open source revolutionBy transforming text descriptions into this language, the researchers were able to create full-fledged mobile applications, which had proved unfeasible with previously proposed methods.This “framework” created by the team of researchers is called Text2App and allows the creation of Android applications using English text only. You just have to describe the desired application and the framework takes care of the rest.If this still sounds a bit mysterious, try to imagine it more simply. Describing an idea, a button, a menu is rather simple thanks to text and there is no need for more. The compiler takes care of the specifics of the code by offering solutions.In the future, various researchers' work will allow for the introduction of new ways of summarising or representing programs. This will allow novices to better understand how the technology of artificial intelligence works, as well as jobs related to coding. This new language will also improve the ability to convert natural languages into an app format.“If we design programming languages or frameworks with AI in mind, our current AI technologies can perform remarkably better in code generation from human language,” outlined Hasan.The researchers have so far only explored a fraction of their program’s true capabilities, so they are offering the opportunity to the open source community to contribute to its evaluation and propose developments.Hasan and his team also hope to use deep-learning machines like the GPT-3, founded by the company OpenAI, to create even more complex applications. – AFP Relaxnews\n",

      "THE beauty of Tawau, Sabah, is set to greet international audiences, thanks to its famous son.A labour of love from award-winning filmmaker Soon King Yaw, work on the story that takes place in his hometown has started.The United States-based filmmaker is developing a tale that unfolds in Tawau to translate its beauty and serenity into film, and share it with the world.Besides his passion-driven project, Soon is currently busy with post-production work for When I See The Wind, a short film he is producing in collaboration with Bay-Area cinematographer Andrés Gallegos. The 29-year-old, who hopes to make feature films one day, attributes his success to his single mother’s perseverance and strong work ethics, which he said have shaped him to become who he is today. Do your best or don’t do it at all, she would say. Living by those words of wisdom, The One Academy graduate made headlines when his animated documentary was chosen as the opening film of the KQED Homemade Film Festival last year.Out of 500 submissions, his short flick All I Did Was Smile and Say Hello bagged one of the Top Five finalists’ spots. It also drew praise from guest judge and former president of the San Francisco Bay-Area Film Critics Circle Randy Myers.The film sheds light on the increased discrimination faced by Asian Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic.Soon’s other short films include My Mother, Myself & I, The White Crow, and Something Carved And Real – all of which have gained accolades and recognition.Currently residing in San Francisco, the creative talent with a keen interest in drawing, painting and music draws inspiration from the environment and the people around him.“I’ve learnt to be open-minded and receptive to all these nuggets of inspiration hidden in the monotony of everyday life. Sometimes when I walk by a scenic place, I would stop and imagine what kind of story I can tell there,” he said.Despite his success today, things have not always been rosy for him.As a teenager, he was forced to face the reality that most educational funds in the country did not offer financial assistance for students pursuing the arts.Upon completing his secondary education, he seized the opportunity to be an exchange student in the US for half a year through the American Field Service Youth Exchange & Study (AFS-YES) programme.It was there that he decided to pursue a career in art, thanks to inspiration drawn from his foster father, who is an artist. Exposure to a culture that appreciates and values the arts spurred him on as well.Upon returning, Soon was bent on securing a scholarship at The One Academy – he knew his mother could not afford the fees. He thus joined the Malaysia Top 10 Outstanding Young Artists Awards organised by the academy in hopes of winning the grand prize of a scholarship.On his first try, Soon clinched the third prize. A year later, he tried again but barely secured a placing, leaving him feeling disappointed.Although he had his mother’s support, he had to put up with scepticism from his relatives and teachers over his choice to study art.“I was told that I had wasted all my SPM A+s to pursue a hobby as a future career and an insecure one at that. Their disapproval made me doubt myself a lot, especially when they compared me to my friends who pursued technology, medicine and law,” he recalled.But his efforts proved to be worthwhile – on his third attempt, he was awarded the Best of the Best award, along with a scholarship to study digital animation.Soon cited Visual Storytelling as among the courses he found most inspiring at The One Academy.“It was here that I was introduced to the beauty of filmmaking. Upon the recommendation of a lecturer, my friends and I formed a team and joined a local competition. Despite having no prior experience in it, we won it.“I’m forever grateful for the lecturer who saw something in me that I didn’t at the time. I’m a filmmaker today because of him,” he shared.In a press release from the academy, Soon credited his technical skills to the industry-oriented syllabus at the academy that gave him a competitive edge over others.Upon graduating, he went on to further his studies in the US and later secured a job as a video editor at Electronic Arts (EA) in Redwood City, beating over 1,000 applicants for the position.Still holding the position now, he spends his free time producing and writing short films focusing on topics close to his heart.\n",

      "MIKE Choong Wai Keng is a lecturer at The Design School at Taylor’s University. When asked about how students should apply their knowledge in forming solutions to an existing problem in society or in the industry, his answer is simple: empathy.“Empathy is the most neglected aspect when designing solutions for society or industry, ” he says.He adds that the School embraces ‘”design thinking”, whereby students are “trained to empathise with the target market or audience to discover the real insights that are often difficult to be explained or communicated.”However, empathy and design thinking are usually not what comes to mind with regard to tertiary education. Many lecturers and students also do not make mastering soft skills a priority.Taylor’s decided to walk the talk when it came to embedding life skills into all of their academic programmes, while giving every student an opportunity to be a creator. The idea is to intentionally nurture the three intelligences of “intellect”, “practical wisdom” and “craft” among its graduates through Taylor’sphere.“Students learn theory from their lecturer or textbooks, but knowledge needs to be applied in real life situations for learning to be effective, ” says Taylor’s School of Psychology lecturer Pang Chia Yee.Pang says there are several ways these are applied in Taylor’s degree programmes, such as through group project work as well as work-based learning and internships.“Many students are so used to structured academic life that when things become unpredictable, such as in real-life situations, they go into panic mode, ” she says.“Society has conditioned them for many years to achieve subject scores, which are individual achievements. However, in college and university, we have group work, which they find challenging because many are weak in communication and leadership skills.”She says that these life skills are crucial to tackle life challenges, noting the importance of other emotional quotient (EQ) aspects such as resilience and emotional management.These are part of the Taylor’s Graduate Capabilities (TGC) that students would be assessed on in every module, she says, and Taylor’s students receive a second transcript describing their competency in these areas.Raja Imran Raja Azhar, a lecturer for the Diploma in Design programme at Taylor’s College, says that first of all, soft skills need to be modelled by academics in order for intellectual aspects to be absorbed successfully.“There were some rare occasions when my communication with my students did not synch, but I would find other approaches to hit that ‘jump-start’ button with them, with regard to their assignments.“Sometimes it’s not about the lack in our academic approach, but more about their personality and traits, and I try to encourage them to be more open in discussions, ” says Raja Imran.Having recently won the RISE Educator Award: Taylorian Edition for his pastoral care and engaging manner of teaching, Raja Imran goes out of his way to ensure his students grasp concepts well.He says that with lockdowns and prolonged periods of online learning, he had to be flexible and creative in his approach to teaching and assessment, returning to some old school methods of using paper and recyclable items, as well as making use of students’ own body measurements and spatial awareness.“Students realised that it’s not the expensive materials that boost their model-making appearance. What designers look for at the end of the day are design ideas and constructability, even with just the use of basic materials such as glue, papers and cutter.“As a result, some first semester students achieved jaw-dropping output, ” he says.And while online learning has not stopped academics from nurturing the intellect, it also did not hinder students from engaging in the craft aspect, as Choong reveals.“Students are exposed to multidisciplinary collaborative projects as early as year one via a university-wide social innovation module which makes it compulsory for students to solve real-world problems with students from other programmes, schools or faculties.“Students are inculcated with the ‘fail fast, learn faster’ growth mindset by embracing the practices of making, tinkering and creating, ” says Choong, who is one of two co-directors at Taylor’s Me.reka Makerspace, who directs the university’s academic integration with industry and community impact.Instilling this “maker” mindset throughout the university has reaped benefits for students, Choong says.“Not only is this an effective way of learning, it drives students to create products instead of only consuming them. This mindset spurs innovation by connecting the students with the right tools, inspiration, opportunity and community of makers.”Choong believes that a suitable atmosphere that allows students to experiment, fail and grow and attain the right set of soft skills is a defining experience that prepares students to adapt to an increasingly volatile and complex world.This is, after all, what makes university worthwhile.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Malaysian students are being moulded into global citizens to increase their competitiveness with the introduction of a new module in schools.Global Citizenship Education (GCED), said United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef) Malaysia education specialist Azlina Kamal (pic), would be taught in all schools at the primary and secondary level next January.The module, which is embedded in the existing curriculum, was recently rolled out in secondary schools nationwide.“We started with the lower secondary students first but the module will be extended to primary schools soon, ” said Azlina.She said the module, incorporated into Mathematics, Science, History and Geography lessons, would train students to find solutions to pressing global issues.“The aim is to equip students with knowledge of global events so that they are able to form well-rounded opinions, ” she said, adding that students will also develop empathetic skills and respect for other cultures and perspectives.Those involved in developing the module were teachers themselves, subject matter experts and ministry officials from various divisions, under the leadership of former Education director-general Datuk Dr Habibah Abdul Rahim who retired on April 5 – the day the module was launched.Habibah, who is also an adjunct professor at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, said GCED was in line with helping Malaysia become a global player.“We are no longer living in our own communities; we are all affected by what is happening beyond our communities.“This comes naturally due to the advancement of digital technology and if we cannot relate and react to what’s happening around us on a larger scale, or if our attitudes and values are not in tune with the world at large, we cannot become a global player, ” she said.Describing the module as progressive, Parent Action Group for Education president Datin Noor Azimah Abdul Rahim lauded the inclusion of topics such as gender equality.\n",

      "PASSION is important but without a “modicum of talent and a truckload of hard work, success will be hard to come by”.That was Prof Dr April Camilla Roslani’s (pic) advice for students.Dr April Camilla, who was awarded the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Honorary Fellowship last year, recently became the first Malaysian to be conferred the Honorary Fellowship of the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS).The ASCRS Honorary Fellowship recognises individuals who have made outstanding achievements and contributions to fields related to colon and rectal surgery, said Universiti Malaya (UM) in a Facebook post on April 30 congratulating its medicine faculty dean and professor of surgery. Dr April Camilla hopes the award will open up more opportunities for collaboration that will take the fraternity to greater heights.Speaking to StarEdu, she shared that academic surgery has not been an easy path as it demands many sacrifices, mentally, physically and socioeconomically.“In a personal capacity, I feel that my career choice, which has at times been questioned by others, has been vindicated.“Professionally, I am proud that colorectal surgery in Malaysia has gained international recognition.“It is a relatively young specialty here, with a very small number of specialists, particularly in the public sector, ” she said.Despite limited capacity within the field, she added that they are still able to deliver quality care, conduct research and train the next generation.“Imagine what we could do with more resources!”Malaysia has come a long way in establishing structured surgical training, she said, adding that there is, however, much to do. Engagement needs to happen much earlier rather than at the pre-university level, as most of the groundwork for developing cognitive, motor and affective skills need to happen in schools.“With regard to formal surgical training programmes, training of trainers needs to be professionalised, workplace-based assessments strengthened, the effectiveness and efficiency of training increased, and the delivery of quality assured examinations improved.“While virtual learning opportunities cannot completely replace hands-on training, we need to integrate its beneficial elements to reduce the gaps that decentralised training can be subjected to.“The research component in training needs to be recognised as a valuable skill, and not a burden, ” she said.It is also imperative to focus more attention on the well-being of trainees and their trainers in order to mitigate the constant attrition in numbers she said,Dr April Camilla hopes students will spend some time understanding themselves – their strengths and weaknesses, what brings them joy, and what they want out of life.“Then, go for it – whatever ‘it’ is. Be ambitious, but be prepared. Start early, be humble, get help. Embrace hard work, but don’t forget to have joy.”She reminded students to not forget to give back and be the mentor they would have liked to have.“Support your colleagues, your alma mater, your country – there are so many ways to do so, be it contributing your time, expertise or financial support, and it will go a long way to relieving their burdens.”A University of Wales graduate, Dr April Camilla has produced about 80 academic research publications. She is also the president of the Academy of Medicine of Malaysia College of Surgeons and the Asia Pacific Federation of Coloproctology.Public varsity researchers highly cited TIME and again, Malaysian researchers have shown their strengths in research.In the recent Clarivate Highly Cited Researchers (HCR) list, Universiti Malaya (UM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) were listed as funders of highly cited papers.Some 21% of the papers came from UM, followed by 12% from UKM and 7% from UTM, according to Clarivate.The researchers, it said, have demonstrated significant influence in their chosen field or fields through the publication of multiple highly cited papers during the last decade.“Their names are drawn from the publications that rank in the top 1% by citations for field and publication year in the Web of Science citation index.“According to Clarivate statistics, HCRs in Malaysia have published more than 3,422 papers from 2009 to 2019.“A large part of the research done by these HCRs are closely linked to achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all ages; ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all; and ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, ” it said during a ceremony held virtually on April 29 by Clarivate and the Higher Education Ministry.During the event, it was also announced that six researchers from UM are on Malaysia’s Clarivate HCR list.They are Prof Dr Abdul Aziz Abdul Raman, Prof Md. Abul Kalam, Prof Kazi Md. Salim Newaz and Prof Wan Mohd Ashri Wan Daud of the varsity’s Faculty of Engineering; Prof Abdullah Gani from the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology; and Prof Nasrudin Abd Rahim from the UM Power Energy Dedicated Advanced Centre, UM said in a press release.Prof Dr Abdul Aziz, who is also the varsity’s deputy vice-chancellor (development), said his research focuses on developing advanced wastewater treatment that is not only cheaper but generates lower carbon footprints.Prof Nasrudin is developing technologies that are dedicated to improving and maximising the generated energy and efficiencies to be deployed. Through collaborations with Kyoto University in Japan, he is working to provide practical rural electrification in South-East Asia.Prof Md. Abul, a mechanical engineer, said his research field is related to thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, solid mechanics, and materials characteristics.“The study on alternative fuels has a significant impact on society.“It creates a lot of jobs and reduces foreign petroleum energy, ” he said.\n",

      "KLUANG: The implementation of home-based teaching and learning (PdPR) not only covers online learning but also manual teaching aids, says Education Minister Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin.He said manual teaching aids could be prepared as suited to teachers and students of a school, after taking into account their constraints.“The PdPR method can be implemented through various approaches, such as preparing manual teaching materials that will be delivered to students or collected by parents at schools. It’s not just online.“We are aware that some schools or students in rural areas do not have access to the Internet, so other alternatives should be used, ” he told reporters after the handing-over ceremony of laptops to 71 students from SMK Felda Kahang Timur here yesterday.Radzi said to support the implementation of the PdPR, the Education Ministry also introduced several educational television channels, including DidikTV, which has received good feedback from parents and students.On the event, Radzi said from the total 417 Form Three students screened, 71 of them who were from the B40 group were selected to receive a laptop and a free 15GB Internet data pass for a year.One of the parents, Hashim Ahmad, 54, said such assistance would definitely help his son Mohd Syafiq Haiqal focus during the PdPR sessions.“Previously, it was a bit difficult for him as he only used a mobile phone, causing him to be less focused. I am very grateful for the government’s aid, ” he said.Housewife Norina Bohari, 39, expressed her gratitude to the government because her son was selected as one of the recipients.“My husband only works at a sawmill and we can’t afford to buy a laptop, ” she said.Meanwhile, the National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) said teachers should be allowed to focus fully on PdPR as other existing programmes under the Education Ministry would merely add to their burden.The NUTP is therefore urging the ministry to temporarily postpone the School Transformation 2025 (TS25) programme; implementation of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) curriculum; Performance Dialogue; the second wave of Malaysian Education Quality Standard; and Integrated Assessment for Education Service Officers.NUTP secretary-general Harry Tan said if the programmes were to continue, it would only add burden and cause teachers to lose their concentration on PdPR implementation.“Educators need to focus fully on PdPR because students have been denied a proper education in the last two years due to Covid-19, ” he added. — Bernama\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: For the second time, Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) candidates will be sitting for their national examinations in the following year.Education Minister Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin said the oral and science practical exams for SPM 2021 will commence in February 2022 while the written exams will begin in March.“The ministry decided to do this after taking into account the current situation and challenges faced by the SPM 2021 exam candidates, ” he said during a press conference yesterday.“The ministry is confident the national exams, normally held in November pre-pandemic, will run smoothly as we already have experience from shifting the 2020 examinations to February 2021.”Radzi said for SPM 2020, the Malaysian Examinations Board had created a detailed standard operating procedure for conducting a public examination during a pandemic.The SOP, he added, saw an increase in the distance between tables, the number of invigilators and the number of classrooms used for the examinations in order to keep students safe from the virus.The number of candidates for SPM 2021 has not been finalised as registration only closes on June 18 but according to the ministry’s website, there are currently more than 14,000 Form Five students in the country.Over 40,000 students sat for SPM 2020 in February this year after going through nearly a full year of home-based learning.The Pakatan Harapan Education Committee and Opposition Parties also released a joint statement yesterday on the ministry’s manner in handling the SPM 2020 examinations.“The failure of the Education Ministry in managing SPM 2020 has caused unnecessary mental and physical stress to students, teachers and parents, ” said the statement signed by 10 opposition politicians, including former Education Minister Dr Maszlee Malik and former Deputy Education Minister Teo Nie Ching and former Youth and Sports Minister Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman.It said the SPM 2021 cohort will be the first to undergo the new exam format, announced only last year, and are also the first to use the new Secondary School Standard Curriculum (KSSM) that was introduced in 2017.The introduction of these new aspects, coupled with the disrupted school sessions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, would mean that SPM 2021 students would face bigger challenges than the SPM 2020 candidates, it stated.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Home-based learning (PdPR) will continue until the National Security Council decides otherwise, says Education Minister Datuk Dr Radzi Jidin.The programme will continue until schools reopen on June 13 and 14 for Group A and Group B schools respectively.Group A are schools in Johor, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu while the other states fall under Group B.“They (national schools) will undergo at least 25 days of PdPR until the (one week) mid-semester school holidays, which starts on July 16 for Group A and July 17 for Group B.” he said.Radzi added that international schools, private schools and expatriate schools must also carry out PdPR throughout the 25 days, based on their own academic calendar.He said the ministry will give one week’s notice before schools resume face-to-face classes.Exam year students will be the first to go back to school when it reopens.While noting teachers and students have problems completing the syllabus using PdPR, Radzi said the ministry had realigned the curriculum last year to three main components – basic content, additional content and complementary content.Thus, to ease the burden of completing the syllabus, he said teachers are required to focus on completing the basic content of the curriculum, that must be mastered by the students, before moving onto the other two components if they have the time.Regarding the Cerdik initiative, Radzi said the ministry has distributed 12,887 digital devices with data plans to 95 schools to date, with another 40,290 units to be distributed by June 12 and another 96,823 units by the end of September.The initiative, announced in Budget 2021, aims to provide 150,000 students from lower-income families with digital access in the form of laptops, tablets, and data connectivity.On another matter, Radzi said he has spoken to National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme coordinating minister Khairy Jamaluddin and that they hope to expedite the vaccine programme for teachers so that they can receive at least their first dose before schools reopen, possibly, at the end of July.More than 70,000 teachers have received at least their first dose to date.The Peninsular Malaysia Malay Students Federation president Mohd Alif Anas Md Noor welcomed Radzi’s announcement to continue with PdPR when schools reopen, saying that this would be a way to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among students.The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) said although the minister has stated that PdPR 2.0 is not set in stone, without an official directive, it will be “business as usual.”“The administrators will follow the circular on PdPR to the letter, the state education departments and district education will monitor the schools like a hawk and none will be the wiser,” its secretary-general Harry Tan said.Melaka Action Group for Parents in Education chairman Mak Chee Kin said it is wise to keep schools closed judging from the latest pandemic statistics.However, he questioned if PdPR was effective as there is no equal access to it across the board with device, Internet and availability of trained teachers being the biggest factors.Parent Action Group for Education Malaysia (PAGE) chairman Datin Noor Azimah Abdul Rahim said there needs to be continuous and consistent checks and balances by school leaders to ensure PdPR is of a high standard.\n",

      "School uses the newspaper to engage students in HIPAT a recent Highly Immersive Programme (HIP) Carnival organised by the Selangor State Education Department in SMK Raja Muda Musa, Selangor, eight schools from six districts – SK Kampung Idaman, SK Binjal, SAM Sg Haji Dorani, SMK Seksyen 4 Kota Damansara, SMK Ampang Pecah, SMK TTDI Jaya and SMK Kuala Selangor – discussed strategies taken by the school administration to achieve its goal of improving English proficiency among students.HIP, which was introduced under the Upholding Bahasa Malaysia and Strengthening English policy, aims to provide a language-rich environment for students to be exposed to the language through various activities within and beyond the classroom.Besides improving English proficiency, it also focuses on inculcating positive behaviour towards learning and using the language.SMK Kuala Selangor English panel head Faridah Kassim shares her experiences in incorporating The Star newspaper and its Newspaper-in-Education (NiE) pullout as part of the school’s Highly Immersive Programme.IN SMK Kuala Selangor, the English language department has carried out many activities under HIP. One of the programmes include our use of the newspaper known as The Star’s NiE pullout.In a quote from her book Quotes with Soul to Make You Feel Whole, Lucille Dass, Star-NiE freelance consultant trainer, states: “Your paper qualifications do not just your credentials make. You are valued mostly according to how you inter-relate and communicate.”In this quote, I believe that the key word here is “communicate”.If “on paper” a student is excellent and shows outstanding grades but is unable to communicate well, the result is not valuable because he will not be able to show for it in life. For example, should this student attend an interview, he will be unable to express his ideas well and hence miss opportunities to better himself.This is a common occurrence because most students these days cannot communicate well. This, in my opinion, is due to the lack of vocabulary in speaking English. This is why the NiE programme is so closely connected to HIP.The newspaper directs students to word exposure. If teachers use the NiE programme in their lessons, students would uncover more words and by doing so, would increase their vocabulary.As a teacher who has used the NiE pullouts in the classroom since 2016, I can vouch that The Star’s NiE programme inspires teachers to be creative in planning their activities.We have used NiE activities suggested in the pullouts and tweaked them to support all types of language-rich activities to create a highly immersive environment in the classroom.We have been fortunate because of a newspaper sponsorship from glove-making company, Hartalega.From this sponsorship, we carried out 21st century teaching and learning lessons. Here, students are divided into teams for group work. To complete tasks, they use materials from the newspaper. The final product is an opportunity to present their outcome in groups.The students in our school are quite familiar with this type of learning methodology because the activities in the Star-NiE pullouts encourage group learning and outcomes. Hence, we have students who are ready to get involved in competitions, especially like the ones organised in the annual Star-NiE contests.Our students are already familiar with the concept of shared learning experiences. This type of learning encourages creativity among students. I am proud to say that through such learning experiences, students from SMK Kuala Selangor clinched the Merit Awards in 2016 and 2018 at the NiE contests, namely, Game 4 Life and Star Flicks.Besides using NiE in the classroom, we use this methodology at our Speaker’s Corner where students carry out one-minute speeches during recess. Each student selects a topic taken from the newspaper and speaks on the issue.The teachers, too, play an active role in the school. They take turns to give one-minute speeches during the assemblies. Even the ustaz and ustazah use the English language during this programme.At co-curriculum activities, NiE is a regular feature during English Camps. Students enjoy expressing their ideas from newspaper articles that pique their interests. They use their creativity to present their findings in groups. These outcomes are displayed at the English Corner at the library which are often referred to by the teachers and students.We would like to thank Hartalega, our newspaper sponsors and The Star for their great support. If you are looking for ideas to spruce up your Highly Immersive Programme in school, Star-NiE is a great tool and resource to turn to!— Faridah Kassim, teacher, SMK Kuala Selangor, Selangor\n",

      "SK SUBANG Bestari 2 recently opened its doors to SK Sungai Buloh English panel head Nurhafizah Yaacob who shared her experience on using the Step Up education pullout by The Star.The sharing session not only gave teachers new ideas to take home but also forged a good relationship between the two schools located in Selangor.The colourful 24-page workbook-cum-activity English pullout is designed to help pupils in Years Four, Five and Six prepare for the Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (UPSR) examination.Step Up also features Chinese and Bahasa Malaysia translations of difficult English words.Nurhafizah recounted the days when her school began their subscription of Step Up, which comes with a copy of The Star newspaper.“Pupils brought the newspaper home and their family felt a subtle change. All this while, they’ve never had an English newspaper in the house.“The parents then contacted the school and suggested that teachers help pupils go through Step Up and incorporate it into lessons,” she said.SK Subang Bestari 2 English panel head Nor Shahbinar Kamil, who teaches Year Six pupils, said that the sharing session was informative.“The students in SK Sungai Buloh and SK Subang Bestari 2 more or less share the the same proficiency levels, so Nurhafizah’s ideas are workable.“This enhances our usage of the pullout.“The session has given me new ideas and the teachers here can expand the usage of Step Up. Apart from using it in class, we can also use it outside of the classroom,” she said.Fellow colleague Siti Farah Azuah Nasir said: “It was a very good sharing session! I’m so glad that she came to our school.”“This is a golden opportunity for teachers in this school to get insights to using Step Up efficiently.“Aside from how to use the pullout, we also learned how to fully utilise the copy of The Star newspaper that comes with the pullout. There are so many activities we can do with the newspaper and the pullout,” she said.“It was also a good gathering for English primary school teachers. It helped us expand knowledge in our line of teaching,” she added.SK Subang Bestari 2 headmaster Md Hishamuddin Md Yaacob said he hopes to have more sharing sessions like this.“It benefits both sides. In the future, we can also share our story with other schools. This is a start of a good relationship between our school and SK Sungai Buloh.”He added that he is thankful that The Star facilitated in helping the school improve English Language teaching.“This helped spark more ideas and showed the many ways teachers can use the pullout and newspaper.”For more information about this English language resource for Primary schools, call The Star’s Customer Care Unit at 1-300-88-7827 from Monday to Friday (9am-5pm). Subscription is through schools only.The pullout is endorsed by the Education Ministry.\n",

      "LITERATURE provides an avenue for students to derive many lessons, which include looking at things from different perspectives and practising empathy.That is what readers get to do through Trevor Millum’s Sad I Ams poem – a text which is part of the English Language literature component for Form One students. In the poem, one is reminded of discarded items, told through the first-person narration.Activities based on the poem, as well as other literary texts, are available for subscribers of The Star’s Newspaper-in-Education (NiE) pullout, which has an English Literature segment centred on the school syllabus.In the pullout, readers will also find teen writers from our BRATs Young Journalist Programme responding to the literary topics and themes.To obtain the activities and read the students’ response, grab a copy of the NiE pullout on Wednesday, March 11.Published bi-monthly, the NiE pullout offers English language activities, and a writing platform for teens. It is available only through school subscriptions of The Star.To subscribe, call the toll free number 1-300-88-7827 (Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm). For more information on Star-NiE’s BRATs programme, go to facebook.com/niebrats.Read on to get a sampling of our teen writers’ response to the Sad I Ams poem. In their response, they wrote fictional autobiographies as they put themselves in the shoes of inanimate objects.Broken into piecesYOU used to stare so deeply into my eyes. Your hands, soft and gentle, used to stroke me so tenderly. “My love, my everything” was your affectionate murmurs as you fixed your fond gaze upon me.I was your pride, the first thing you showed everyone whenever they came; your joy, the last thing you reached for before you fell asleep. I was your protector of the night, standing on the table with a bouquet of roses beside me, both of us keeping watch over you.One evening, the roses went first. As you threw her into the bin, I could only close my eyes to block out the cries of heartache from the roses. (Or was it from you?)The sobs lasted throughout the night, and for the first time, you didn’t take a single glance at me.“This is only temporary, ” I reassured myself, “how would you ever bear to neglect me, whom you call ‘your love, your everything’?”Still, I was filled with a sense of foreboding. At dawn, the sun cast its scorching rays over the room, creating a reflection of light from my glass frame. I felt your gaze upon me, and beamed with delight as you lifted me up slowly.Suddenly, droplets of water came trickling down across my picture of a handsome man. You no longer wailed like you did last night; now, tears flowed silently down your face.Slowly but certainly, a hint of rage started to creep into your eyes. It struck me then that I would never feel your warm look or kind touch again. The same eyes now glared at me in anger, and the same pair of hands hurled me against the wall.Shattered images of love spilled all over the cold marble floor. There I lay, broken and in pieces.Still, I waited. Day after day, I lay there, waiting to be glued back together by your renewed love. But when you swept me away, I realised I didn’t deserve your love anymore. — Ooi Shinz Jo, 16, Chung Ling Private High School, PenangWorn outALLOW me to introduce myself – I am a blouse, born in a factory in Bangladesh. The seamstresses were very efficient, fashioning my friends and me out of plain cloth without any respite in between.Afterwards, I was packed in a box with a dozen of my friends and loaded onto a lorry, which took us to the airport, where we were delivered to Malaysia.In Malaysia, we were taken to a famous international clothing store in Pavilion Kuala Lumpur, where I was hung on a display rack along with my friends.Lots of people came to this store to check out my friends and me as we were affordable and trendy. After a week at the store, I was finally taken off the rack and landed in the arms of a fashionable teenager. Her name was Clara.Clara was proud of me and wore me whenever she could. She took good care of me, always making sure I wasn’t dirtied or damaged, while she stowed her other clothing deep inside her closet. I never had to wait long to be lifted into her arms. I felt so loved and wanted.One day, while I was on one of my rare breaks, Clara entered her room. In her arms was a new blouse. She hung it next to me. I was glad to make a new friend. Little did I know this new friend would be my curse. From then on, Clara started wearing the new blouse, instead of me.I couldn’t believe the turn of events; I thought I would always be Clara’s favourite. What’s worse, I was eventually tossed to the back of her closet, along with others, to make way for newer, trendier clothes.By and by, we overheard Clara’s mother telling her to do something about us as her closet started to overflow. The next day, Clara took us downstairs and dumped us in the trash can, without so much as a backward glance.We ended up in a landfill, far away from Kuala Lumpur. Her actions broke our hearts, but all we could do was to suffer silently. Unfortunately, it would take me – a polyester blouse – hundreds of years to disappear. This is the consequence of fast fashion. — Dennis Lai Yong Jia, 14, SMK Seri Hartamas, Kuala LumpurCannedI REMEMBER being produced in a shabby, old beverage factory where I was later placed in a box and shipped away. We were delivered to a local gas station and got placed in an arctic-like machine. I got the window seat, together with a few others, who shared my curiosity for the future.Three days later, a teenager came walking in. His name was Dennis Fitch. He observed us from behind the transparent wall for a few seconds. Soon after, he reached out for me.It was an exhilarating moment being held in his hand. Though it made me weaker with his every sip, I was thankful I was the one he chose to quench his thirst. Once we reached his car, I was placed in my very own seat. What a thoughtful person, I thought as we drove off.I envisioned the great life we were going to have. It was going to be like everything I had dreamed of. Fifteen minutes later, I was three-quarters gone. My vessel became fragile and I felt lighter than before.Shortly after, we arrived at our destination. Dennis picked me from my seat as he exited the vehicle and made for the beach. Everything around me was enchanting. The sky was a pastel pink as the sunset hit the water and the sand.Dennis took off his sandals and let the cool water sweep over his feet while he glanced at the distance. I felt blissful in that moment.Out of nowhere, a young girl’s voice broke my reverie. She was calling Dennis’ name. Without hesitation, he dropped me and walked away. As I drifted away from the shore, I stared at Dennis’ receding figure. I received no goodbye, not a backward glance, nor a final sip. — Tasshyea P.K. Sivakumaran, 18, Sunway College, Subang Jaya, SelangorA life of serviceSOMETIME in December 2010, two young girls waltzed into a uniform store with their parents. The mother asked the worker at the store to bring out some samples of white baju kurung.It was back-to-school season. I was a highly sought-after product. The lady asked for two pairs of baju kurung for each of her daughters, both in small sizes because of her children’s petite physiques.I was placed in a bag alongside other articles that looked identical to me. The amount of excitement I felt was indescribable.The girl I served turned out to be the younger daughter, who was only six. Her mother placed me on the ironing board to rid me of any creases, ensuring her child would look fresh and clean on her first day in school.The young girl seemed nervous while getting dressed, staring at herself in the mirror, afraid of the challenges ahead. She grabbed her backpack and put on her white slip-on shoes.Right before she headed out the door, she took one last look in the mirror. This time, her nervousness had dissolved, replaced by a look of determination on her face. This was a new beginning, a new chapter that she couldn’t wait to start, and she knew that I’d be there with her every step of the way.I served my owner for three full years, until the day her mother put me into a plastic bag along with other pieces to be donated. My young owner went through the bag and took one last look at me, reminiscing about all the memories we had lived through together.Like the time she got a sticker from her teacher for having the best drawing in class, or the time she fell down in the school’s parking lot while chasing her friend, and tore a small part of me which had to be sewn up.It was a bittersweet journey to say the least, but I was ready to serve another young one. I was ready for my new life. — Firza Azureen Ridzuan, 16, SMK Puteri Titiwangsa, Kuala Lumpur\n",

      "KUALA TERENGGANU: Ex-Petro­nas scholar and Terengganu native Datuk Raiha Azni Abd Rahman shared a joyful and nostalgic mo­ment with the Petronas Education Sponsorship Programme (PESP) 2019 recipients during its award ceremony.“I was curious about the outside world, so I applied to go to the United States and I got it.“I did my tertiary education in New York and it was the best time of my life!” said the company’s senior vice-president (group human re­source management) during the ceremony held at Institut Teknologi Petroleum Petronas in Batu Rakit here yesterday.Raiha, who has been with Petronas for 35 years, told the recipients that it was a “different ball game” in the university.“You have to be independent because you are on your own. It’s how you acclimatise to different environments and manage yourself.“Do mix around as it is the only time to experience other people’s culture.”Star Media Group’s Ng receiving the mock sponsorship cheque from Raiha and Satiful (right).The awards were presented to the recipients by Terengganu state executive council member in charge of education Satiful Bahri Mamat.The 40 Terengganu students were among 400 selected from a total of over 7,355 applicants nationwide.This year, a total of RM156mil was allocated for the sponsorship.Petronas is also adopting 10 trust schools in Terengganu – five each in Kijal and Marang – from 2017 to 2021.The trust school programme by Petronas is a tie-up between Yaya­san Amir and the Education Ministry.Introduced in 2015, the Trenglish (Transforming English in Tereng­ganu) programme, involving 50 schools in the state, is a collaborative effort between the oil and gas company with the state education department and Yayasan Tereng­ganu.Trenglish aims to increase Eng­lish language proficiency among the students.As an added boost, Petronas is sponsoring RM150,000 worth of The Star’s Newspaper-in-Education (NiE) pullout to supplement the programme for the third year.Star Media Group chief content officer Esther Ng received the mock cheque at the event.Written by a team of experienced English language specialists, the NiE pullout is packed with engaging hands-on newspaper activities for the classroom.As supplements to the Petronas’ sponsorship, four NiE workshops are included – two for teachers and two for students – for a more effective use of newspapers in the classroom.One of the recipients, Muhammad Adib Rusydi Mohd Zawawi from Imtiaz Kuala Berang, said that NiE and Trenglish had helped him tremendously as the interview with Petronas was held in English.\n",

      "How Malaysia’s Parliament created a politician like Tajuddin\n",
      "Opinion\n",
      "PROF DR MOHD TAJUDDIN MOHD RASDI\n",
      "RECENTLY, a politician was removed from his position heading a government-linked corporation amidst protests over what was seen as his cavalier treatment of a rail accident that saw many injured, some seriously. Malaysians came down hard on his manners and conduct that seemed, to many, to be rude, unprofessional and demeaning to journalists as well as to the gravity of the accident.I am not defending that politician but I would like to point out that his unprofessional and un-Malaysian conduct is no more than a reflection of a political culture developed over more than four decades under one ruling power and the support of a great many people of one race as well as the apathy of others.Let us look at one example of Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman’s “style of politics” in Parliament. He once made a crude “joke” about an Opposition woman MP’s name which was greeted with much hilarity by his party’s MPs, both male and female.My first criticism is about how our Speakers in Parliament deal with issues of foul language, sexist statements and racial slurs. The Speakers keep saying things like “Yang Berhormat, tolong tarik balik, Yang Berhormat (sir, please retract, sir)”.If I were the Speaker, I would not say “tarik balik”, I would simply say “Yang Berhormat, tolong balik, Yang Berhormat (sir, please leave, sir)” – I would have suspended him for three months without any allowances if it were within my power to do so.As a Speaker, I would not tolerate one iota of racial slurs, sexist remarks or foul language. Members of Parliament who make these remarks would never get a second chance from me. Our Speakers and Parliament’s disciplinary practice must be firm or else the august House is just an overdeveloped kedai kopi (coffee shop).Secondly, what happened to the women MPs of his party? They should have come to the defense of their own gender instead of snickering derisively behind Tajuddin.It was a rude, sexist and foul remark of the lowest form – on the level of a boy threatening to rape his classmate, as in the recent “rape joke” incident.Despite the fact that the woman MP was from another party and of another race, other women MPs, regardless of party affiliation or race, should have stood up to Tajuddin and reminded him that it was akin to insulting his wife, daughter and mother. No wonder the likes of Tajuddin can still speak like this in Malaysia’s Parliament.Thirdly, I want to ask non-Malay MPs why they kept quiet when Tajuddin clearly made a racist joke using the woman MP’s Chinese name. By virtue of their silence, non-Malay groups too allow such behaviour in Parliament. Integrity, dignity and adab (manners) must go beyond race, religion and party politics if we are to rebuild this country and ensure just treatment of all.Fourthly, I wish to discuss Tajuddin’s political party. In the last 40 years, Umno, to me, seems to have condoned politicians who are quick to use racial slurs. It seems to me that to be elected to higher office in the party, a candidate simply needs to attack other races or make jokes about the “other”.Some have resorted to waving a keris about, even.There was a politician who called people who were demonstrating “beruk” (apes) and dubbed the Speaker a “Taliban” – and this politician has worn the mantle of minister for many years.There are those who use the word “pendatang” (immigrant) to refer to non-Malays and are quick to say that Malaysia belongs to one race – and these people keep rising to ever higher positions. It seems that such behaviour goes down well within the party and among its grassroots.Finally, I wish to address the people who see the likes of Tajuddin as a hulubalang, or champion, of the race. Imam Al Ghazali’s magnum opus published in the 12th century, Al-Ihya Ulumuddin, has a chapter dedicated to “The Destruction of Speech” in which he described the ethics of communication, conversations and speech that would destroy a Muslim’s piety and good position in the Hereafter. Those who support the behaviour and adab of people like Tajuddin will surely be questioned over their choice of a representative and leader in this life. Such leaders will not only be judged with strict justice but all of their supporters will also be judged. If the supporters make no effort to advise these leaders to treat others with respect and dignity, then judgment will be pronounced on all of them.Just as in this world where each citizen is responsible for his or her own vote, each soul must answer for his or her actions. People should read Al-Ihya Ulumuddin before they cast their votes to send out their representatives into the world because they will be held responsible for that choice.Tajuddin is not at fault alone, for it is ultimately us, Malaysians, who have to think about how to create a Parliament with members who treat citizens of all races, faiths and stations with respect, dignity and compassion.Prof Dr Mohd Tajuddin Mohd Rasdi is Professor of Architecture at UCSI University.

      "A FEW days before the national lockdown was announced, the social media platforms of the Mentri Besar of Selangor posted a question: Is the movement control order (MCO) necessary now?More than 150,000 people responded via Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, overwhelmingly welcomed a lockdown. This is despite the state’s Covid-19 task force chairman’s view that a stricter lockdown is not the solution to contain the pandemic.Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad feels that there were more effective ways to contain the spread of the pandemic. He was calling for a more targeted and effective lockdown, coupled with mass testing. The idea is to identify and isolate those with the virus.Many experts will agree with Dr Dzulkefly under normal circumstances. But things have changed for the worse. The spike in the number of cases has put the state government in a dilemma.Mass testing, the very mechanism that is hailed as the right move forward, is responsible for the alarming numbers of those infected.In a long run, it will help the state. But for now, Selangor has to go through another round of stricter and more painful MCO just like the rest of the country.Health experts have cautioned the impending crisis for some time already.In an online conversation with Star Media Group adviser Datuk Seri Wong Chun Wai, Kumpulan Karangkraf chairman Datuk Hussamuddin Yaakob and I last week, Prof Datuk Dr Adeeba Kamarulzaman highlighted a study conducted by the Institute for Health Metric and Evaluation (IHME) of the University of Washington in the United States.The projection for Malaysia is alarming, the estimated death rate could be as high as 200 a day. The total death toll from Covid-19 may reach up to a staggering 26,000 by September.Dr Adeeba, formerly the Dean of the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), is currently a Science Council Member for the World Health Organisation.But some argued that this MCO is either half-hearted, half-baked or a half-measure. How strict is strict is a matter of semantics. There are simply too many exemptions to begin with.The city of Melbourne has implemented a total lockdown when 60 people tested positive to a more sinister variant called Kappa.Millions have to endure an extended lockdown after the first seven-day lockdown ended.The acting state premier of Victoria told reporters: “We’ve got to run this thing to ground, otherwise people will die.”Malaysia is seeing more than 8,000 new cases each day now. It is simply reckless not to take heed.We have seen how communities are infected. Most of us have seen family members, relatives, friends, colleagues and neighbours infected and sadly some succumbed to the virus.The virus is at everyone’s doorsteps.Lockdowns are hurtful and painful.In our case it has impacted the economy rather badly. Companies are winding up, people losing their jobs.The worst hit are those in the B40 category – Mak Cik Kiah included.The pandemic has shown another disturbing reality – inequality in wealth distribution. Those in the lower income group suffer much more than upper income Malaysians.We did right the first time. Everyone was on board in a ship traversing troubled waters. But we rejoiced too early.We were gleefully watching Singapore struggling with infections among its migrant workers. We did very well indeed that we let our guard down. We celebrated too early. We didn’t have an exit strategy. We inflicted upon ourselves the injury that we are dealing with now – the Sabah state election, our attitude and discipline, and many more.The people shouldn’t be blamed entirely. They wanted to move on with their lives. Lives must be saved, so too are livelihoods. Many were willing to make sacrifices and they did that.The government is partly to be blamed,too, for its indecisiveness, flip flops, and U-turn regarding policies and conflicting statements made by the ministers.We need to look at the surveillance and monitoring system. We have MySejahtera, which despite its occasional shortcomings should be utilised to the maximum. After all we have the capacity, the technology and the know-how.Experts have been talking about a holistic, all-in-society approach in dealing with the pandemic. Community engagement is critical. It shouldn’t be top-down approach all the time.Political parties must mobilise its machinery like the ones they have during elections – to reach out to the people. They must help withthe registration and vaccination appointments for the needy, especially the elderly in rural areas.Other than adhering to the SOP and to expedite the national immunisation programme, people must be part of the entire construct as stakeholders.This is our last chance to get out of this pandemic. We have no other options. We will have to make sure that this MCO is successful. Too much is at stake here.

      "ALMOST one week has gone by since a full lockdown was imposed but the number of new Covid-19 cases and deaths are still significantly high.By next Monday, with the end of two weeks of full movement control order phase, these numbers are unlikely to change by much, say experts.To date Malaysia has breached the 600,000 mark of Covid-19 cases, since March 18 last year, when the pandemic was declared. There have been more than 3,000 deaths related to this disease reported in hospitals nationwide throughout this period.A study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in the United States recently revealed the Covid-19 death toll in this country may reach a staggering 26,000 by September, based on the current trajectory, if Malaysia doesn’t bring the number of infections down significantly.If not, this means in the next three months another 23,000 Malaysians could die – an average of 250 deaths a day.Despite these grim figures, many Malaysians still had a lackadaisical attitude towards the SOP designed to fight the virus.For instance, we hear daily of people being caught for not wearing masks in public.And our roads are still busy despite most shops and shopping complexes being closed for business nationwide. Where are all these people going?Malaysians need to ask themselves how much longer we can endure this situation that is bringing the economy to its knees.The country’s financial health is also not in the best state, with statutory debt expected to hit 58.5% of GDP this year, coming in at RM975bil.While the government does its best, pouring billions into aid for those who have lost jobs and preventing more businesses from folding, Malaysians must also do their part to reduce the infection rate.This is every individual’s responsibility as we are running out of time with the country’s reserves depleting and our healthcare system stretched to breaking point.Other than staying home and strictly following the SOP when in public, we have to achieve herd immunity against this disease by getting 80% of the population vaccinated by the end of this year.While health authorities are boosting vaccination rate from 100,000 doses daily now to 200,000 shots by next month, Malaysians must do their part by registering for vaccination and more importantly, turning up for their appointments.We must not just flash the trendy #KitaJagaKita hashtag on social media but also play our part to get ourselves out of this pandemic.Stay safe, stay home, and get vaccinated!\n",

      "FORTY-FIVE years ago today, a Nomad N-22B aircraft that had entered Kota Kinabalu airport airspace began a one-and-a-half-turn spiral plummet that ended in disaster. The plane, which had departed from Labuan, crashed into shallow waters off the coast of Kampung Sembulan Baru, Kota Kinabalu.Killed in the tragedy on June 6,1976, was the crème de la crème of Berjaya, which had been led by its president, Tun Fuad Stephens, to victory over Usno just two months before in the Sabah state election. The dead were Tun Fuad (Sabah Chief Minister), Datuk Peter Mojun-tin (Local Government and Housing Minister), Datuk Salleh Sulong (Finance Minister), Chong Thain Vun (Communications and Works Minister) and Darius Binion (assistant to the Chief Minister).Others who also perished were Datuk Wahid Peter Andu (permanent secretary to the Finance Ministry), Syed Hussein Wafa (director of the Economic Planning Unit), Johari (Fuad’s son), Captain Gandhi Nathan (pilot), Corporal Said Mohammad (bodyguard) and Ishak Atan (Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah’s executive assistant).Two Australian-made Nomad N-22B aircraft had flown out of Labuan where federal and state leaders had met to discuss oil royalties. The other plane carried noted politicians like Finance Minister Tengku Razaleigh, Sarawak Chief Minister Tun Abdul Rahman Ya’kub and Sabah deputy chief minister Tun Harris Salleh, who would later replace Tun Fuad as chief minister.Today, it will be a quiet memorial for the “double six” tragedy, which remains a mystery among Sabahans who have many conspiracy theories about it.Sabah NGO Sunduvan has been organising a commemoration ceremony on June 6 every year since the tragedy; it will be a virtual one this year because of the current movement control order phase.According to Sunduvan chairman Aloysius Danim Siap, the tragedy is significant because it is linked to the petroleum agreement between the Sabah government and Kuala Lumpur.“The agreement was signed a week after the plane crash that killed Tun Fuad and three other state Cabinet ministers as well as key state government officials at the time, ” he said.The double six crash is also significant because among the dead was Peter Mojuntin, 37, who came to be immortalised in a 1978 book titled Peter J. Mojuntin: The Golden Son of the Kadazan by Bernard Sta Maria. However, the Malaysian government banned the book on the Moyog assemblyman who held the state seat in the Penampang parliamentary constituency.Peter’s nephew, Petrus Conrad, wants the ban to be lifted: “It’s high time our younger generation got to know the political history of Sabah during that period, ” he said.As a Kadazan from Penampang, I have my own memories of the legend. I remember an anecdote that illustrates why Peter was often called the people’s politician – supposedly Peter ate a dish of nonsom (a Kadazan preserved delicacy) a villager had served him even though it had giuk (worms) in it. Somehow this story that I heard three or four decades ago has stuck in my mind.I asked Petrus whether the story was true.“This is a story related to me by my mother, Theresa Bajerai. On my uncle’s campaign trail in remote Kudat, during lunchtime he was served nonsom bakas (preserved wild boar with rice and salt). He saw there were some giuk. He said the people there ate it, so he ate it too, as giuk is full of protein, ” Petrus related.Petrus also said his uncle was a gifted orator: “When he gave a speech, he spoke boldly and fierily, and everybody would listen closely.”To get an insight into Peter and the double six tragedy, I sent some questions to his brother, Datuk Conrad Mojuntin, Petrus’ father.Conrad believes the crash was connected to the oil royalties negotiation. He related one of the famous conspiracy theories many Sabahans believe, that an officer in Kota Kinabalu airport’s control tower did not now allow the plane to land, instructing it to circle a few times.Conspiracy theorists also love to share a video supposedly of Tengku Razaleigh explaining what happened minutes before the aircraft flew out of Labuan airport.In the video titled Oil for Who? uploaded in 2010 to the now defunct website razaleigh.com, Razaleigh is heard telling audience in a community hall in Penampang near Kota Kinabalu: “When talking about oil and Sabah I cannot help but remember a sad incident which happened to Sabah and Sabahans.“I myself had boarded the plane. We were all strapped in – wearing seat belts – on the plane. I sat behind Tun Fuad Stephens, and on my right was (Sarawak’s Chief Minister) Rahman, and behind me was the Tengku Bendahara Pahang, ” said the then Finance Minister.“Suddenly, Harris Salleh, who was Sabah deputy chief minister, asked me to exit the plane as he said it is better that we go [in the second aircraft] to Pulau Banggi to see a cattle ranch.”I asked Conrad, who was 28 years old in 1976, why he thinks Peter became a legend. He replied that it’s because his brother was willing to die for his people.“He was fighting for freedom of religion and basic human rights, specifically that the Kadazan people should be treated equally, ” he said.For me, the double six tragedy represents the what-ifs of Sabah history. The air crash killed Sabah leaders who had been seen as a new hope for the state.How different would Sabah have been if Peter or the other Berjaya leaders like Tun Fuad, Darius Binion, and Salleh Sulong hadn’t died? Would Sabah have agreed to receive only 5% royalties for its oil? Would Sabah have given away Labuan as a federal territory?“Sabah would never have agreed to 5%. Labuan would not have been given away, ” said Conrad, who replaced his brother as the Moyog assemblyman in a by-election in 1976, eventually becoming Sabah minister for Culture, Youth and Sport.If Sabah had got 20% oil rights, would its political and economic history be different?\n",

      "Cycleworld serves the the cold chain industry, from food to Covid-19 vaccine storageAT the frozen food section of the supermarket you can find an array of foods such as tempura prawns, fish balls, chapati and many others.Do you ever wonder if the freshness of the foods is maintained throughout the supply chain, and there is no break in the chain when it comes to keeping the items frozen?This is where Cycleworld comes in.With some 28 years of serving the cold chain industry, Cycleworld Corporation Sdn Bhd builds cold rooms to ensure food supplies are kept fresh and frozen.Born and bred in Malaysia, Cycleworld has been a building material provider to the cold chain industry since 1993, serving the food and beverage, cosmetics and logistics industries, and recently, the medical and pharmaceutical industry for Covid-19 vaccine storage.Cycleworld has a factory on a 2ha-site in Klang that manufactures sandwich panels for the Malaysian market and also exports some 50% of its product to Asean countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar and Cambodia, to name a few.A manufacturer of insulated sandwich panels – a structure made of three layers including a low-density core and a thin skin-layer bonded to each side – Cycleworld acquires raw material in the forms of chemicals for the production of its polyurethane (PUR) rigid foam and polyisocyanurate (PIR) rigid foam.Cycleworld ‘s panel construction method – steel skin PUR rigid foam panels – was popular in Europe after World War II, where advances in chemical knowledge, quick-build technology together with lightweight construction methods were paramount to the post-war boom.By the late 1950s and early 60s, building a large warehouse with insulated sandwich panels had become mainstream construction and today, almost all large industrial cold rooms are built using insulated sandwich panels.This method is comparable to other building materials like concrete or brick for commercial purposes, except that insulated sandwich panels far exceed the properties of thermal resistance.The insulating property of PUR is touted to be some 700% better than brick, whereby the thermal resistance (km/w) of PUR and PIR is between 0.022 and 0.028km/w whereas brick is only between 0.49 and 0.87 km/w.Meanwhile, when the foam is being manufactured, the foam is thermally bonded on pre-painted galvanised iron (PPGI) skins, and then moulded into sizes resembling large Lego block-like panels.This is the base when building a myriad of applications, such as industrial cold rooms, temperature-controlled warehouses, roofing, communication cabins and many others. Furthermore, this base can span across many industries.The year 2019 was an exceptionally good year for Cycleworld.It completed the supply of insulated panels and cold chains related products, such as Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems (ASRS), to the single-largest automated cold room built in Vietnam.The construction of the warehouse measured about 120,000cm3 of temperature-controlled space on land spanning some 7,600sqm in Ho Chi Minh City to house more than 59,000 tonnes of product.The same year, Cycleworld unveiled its latest investment, a state-of-the-art 33m double belt that fully automated the production line which quadrupled Cycleworld’s production capacity.This investment has been supported by the increasing demand for cold chain facilities in Malaysia and the Asean region.Today, with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a rapid increase in e-commerce activities which propelled the rise in demand for cold chain and logistic facilities as well.With a strong business foundation, Cycleworld has also diversified its business portfolio by producing a range of panels made from cement fibre board skins – also known as FastFix panels – instead of metal skins used for the construction of modular housing and buildings.Its excellent thermal insulation qualities, as well as its lightweight feature, are suitable for quick builds.This division known as Cycleworld’s Modular Division is at its infancy, but has already gained Industrialised Building System (IBS) status from the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB) and has been steadily exporting FastFix panels to Australia over the past five years.\n",

      "Businesses need accounting and finance professionals who are trained to do more than crunch numbers.ACCOUNTANTS are currently the fourth most in-demand professionals in Malaysia, according to the Institute of Labour Market Information and Analysis which listed them in the top five hottest jobs in May.Financial skills are among the most in-demand capabilities in today’s competitive job market, despite the pandemic.According to professional recruitment consultancy Robert Walter Malaysia, to attain a position such as a finance leader, graduates need a good mix of business and accounting abilities.In current times of uncertainty and economic volatility, the CPA Australia program allows accountants and finance professionals to hone necessary skills and safeguard their career with the backing of a world-renowned designation and a network of industry experts.Pursuing global success“One of my main reasons for choosing the CPA Program was because of its global recognition and in our home country, ” says Dutch Lady Milk Industries Berhad assistant supply chain finance manager Jamie Cheah.“It developed my critical thinking and decision-making abilities and allowed me to consider the current economy and industry trends when suggesting business strategies.“I would definitely encourage my peers to take up the CPA Australia qualification because it gives you a deeper, more specialised knowledge not only of accounting but of contemporary business issues and global strategy and leadership that incorporate real-world scenarios, ” she says.Like Cheah, former Yayasan Peneraju scholar Tengku Ikram Hussain, who is now an assistant finance manager for Total Marine Technology, says the program helped him to learn new accounting standards relevant to his work.“At the same time, the subjects offered by the CPA Program have equipped me with knowledge on business, strategy and leadership for the future.“My only wish is I had started sooner. I shall forever be grateful to Yayasan Peneraju for sponsoring my study, ” he says.Tengku Ikram was also attracted by the graduation benefits, among them membership of a globally recognised accounting professional body, CPA Australia.Furthermore, as a father-of-two, Tengku Ikram also needed a study option that was flexible.As well as providing the option of test centre exams or online proctored exams in most locations globally, the CPA Program offers an online learning platform that includes extensive resources from business simulations, video resources and weekly webinars to module quizzes and downloadable study notes.“I could study anytime online, and the guided learning resources that map out a step-by-step learning journey throughout the semester include everything you need to help you achieve a great result in your exam, ” he says.Gaining a competitive edgeChengco PLT’s audit associate Chua Jie Sheng, who has gained high distinctions in Ethics and Governance, Financial Reporting, Strategic Management Accounting and Advanced Audit and Assurance, agrees the CPA Program has given him an edge in his career.“Rather than merely follow what was done in the past, the CPA Program prompted me to take a step back and think if there are better ways to perform my tasks.“For example, insights from Strategic Management Accounting have helped me manage the expectations of both internal and external parties and taught me about increasing job scope as technology improves and market demands change, ” he says.Chua believes the quality of the CPA Program’s learning resources outperform those of other qualifications.“My father who ran a multi-disciplinary professional service read my Strategic Management Accounting textbook and became so excited by the information – till we were fighting to use the book.“For a textbook to have such an impact on a businessman, I believe the subjects taught by CPA have quality and are applicable in the business world, ” he said.For more details on the CPA Program, attend one of the Become A CPA Information Session webinars.

      "HISTORY was made at London’s Battersea Power Station (BPS) recently after the much-loved landmark – which is at the heart of a £9bil (RM52.8bil) regeneration project – opened the doors to its first-ever residents.Homeowners received their keys following the completion of Switch House West, the Power Station’s first major element. The rest of the building will follow in stages, with the Boiler House and Switch House East set to welcome new residents in the coming months.The Grade II* listed former coal-fired power station had laid dormant and derelict for decades after decommissioning in the 1980s, but is undergoing a major transformation to restore and repurpose it for modern use.It will be the crown jewel and focal point of a 42-acre (17ha) mixed-used development located on a former industrial brownfield site on the southern banks of the River Thames – which is regarded as one of the best urban regeneration projects not just in England, but all of Europe.It is jointly developed by Malaysia’s S P Setia Bhd, the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) and Sime Darby Property Bhd, under a consortium known as Battersea Power Station Development Co Ltd.Besides adaptive reuse of the Power Station, the masterplan also sees the creation of new residential, cultural and event spaces interspersed with community facilities and serviced by a Zone 1 extension to the London Underground’s Northern Line.There will be over 3mil sq ft of commercial spaces, including several hundred shops, cafes and restaurants, a theatre, hotel and medical centre. 19 acres of the site will be dedicated to public space, including a six-acre (2.4ha) park and 450m of river frontage.Once complete, it will be one of London’s most vibrant neighbourhoods and business quarters. An estimated 25,000 people will live and work here, serving as the anchor for the Vauxhall, Nine Elms and Battersea Opportunity Area.This exciting premise makes BPS a worthy Gold Award winner under the Masterplan Category of the FIABCI World Prix d’Excellence Awards 2021.A transformative journeyWhile the overall BPS masterplan was designed by Rafael Viñoly, each phase of the development was also shaped by the innovative ideas and visions of a range of specialist architects.Circus West Village has drawn millions of visitors since it opened its doors in 2017. The first phase is now home to more than 1,500 residents and includes facilities such as an entertainment room, cafe, spa and a gym.The Power Station is now nearing completion, and its 253 new homes are among the finest in the city. A truly modern, mixed-used building that belies its utilitarian past, it is also house Apple’s new UK Campus.The public facilities will open next year and include a 2,000-capacity event space, cinemas, office spaces and open piazzas. There will also be over 100 shops and F&B offerings, including an 18,500sq ft food hall, housed in the historic turbine halls.Also notable is the Chimney Lift Experience, to be operated by global events and entertainment leader IMG.A glass elevator transporting visitors 109m up inside one of the Power Station’s chimneys, it tops off with 360° views of the English capital’s skyline.“Naturally, transforming a Grade II* listed brick building that was never originally designed to be inhabited comes with its own challenges. We worked closely with all parties involved, including the architects and Historic England, to ensure it is brought back to life most sensitively and respectfully.“The building was on the UK’s ‘Risk Register’ before development started, which meant it was so badly decayed that it was at risk of further deterioration potentially beyond the point of return.“We had to source over 1.7 million new bricks from the original quarries and rebuild all four iconic chimneys using the exact same building methods used to construct them in the past.“Though challenging, it had always been our top priority to restore the Power Station to its original glory whilst retaining as much of its original essence as possible. Its heritage and history are deeply important and significant, ” said Simon Murphy, CEO of Battersea Power Station Development Company.The primary design goal was to reinforce the Power Station as the site’s main architectural feature by setting it in a formal space defined by a reflecting pool and open views to and from the Thames and its north bank.The development will also evolve with London’s new focus on sustainability. The mass of all new buildings were iteratively adjusted based on sun studies to ensure that all spaces will benefit from maximum daylight and views.Simultaneously, the forms of each new structure were also developed to support both passive cooling and user-controlled enclosures.This – together with a Combined Cooling, Heating and Power (CCHP) system on-site that links to a series of small plants feeding into surrounding residential buildings – makes BPS one of the largest, low-carbon developments in Europe.“Given its history and iconic status, BPS has all the makings to become a top cultural destination in London. It has gained significant interest, especially among arts and culture-fond Londoners, in the past few years following several successful pop-ups and events.“Both Circus West Village and the Power Station have a carefully curated list of retailers and operators to keep it entirely new, experiential and distinct from other retail destinations in London. The following phases will also see a good mix of upscale and high-street brands, ” added Murphy.An exciting futureDatuk Ahmad Pardas Senin, chairman of Battersea Project Holding Company, said, “As custodians of this globally significant building, this is indeed a proud day for Malaysia and the consortium of shareholders.“A new lease of life has been given to this historic building as restoration of its landmark features and transformation into a sustainable development will make it a highly sought-after address.”On the horizon is Phase 3A that includes Battersea Prospect Place, which will be renowned Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry’s first residential space in the UK. Its buildings will all have access to a private garden, and each home comes with its own winter terrace.There is also Battersea Roof Gardens, designed by prominent British architecture firm Foster + Partners. It comprises a mix of apartments and a new hotel with a rooftop swimming pool, bar and restaurant.Finally, there is Electric Boulevard. Conceptualised as London’s most exciting new high street, it will be home to world-class bars and restaurants, as well as flagship stores for some of the finest British and international brands.Battersea Power Station Development Company chairman Datuk Wong Tuck Wai added, “Strong progress continues to be made across the entire project, and we are delighted to see the Malaysian Vision for this thriving new London neighbourhood now becoming a reality. Congratulations to the team who had worked relentlessly to see this through, especially during this challenging Covid-19 pandemic period.”Visit batterseapowerstation.co.uk for details about the development, or follow @BatterseaPwrStn on social media for updates.\n",

Solar panels also help reduce energy consumption. All these ensures operations are clean, green and sustainable, with a lower carbon footprint.Modern community featuresMore than a warehouse, The 12 Waves also features rest and recreational amenities open to the public – including The Service Area with a convenience store, food court, public restrooms and ATM.

Many studies have also indicated that this behaviour shift (to online shopping) is likely to continue even post pandemic.Coupled with the economic impact Malaysia is facing, we have seen a growing interest in Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) as a payment option which offers consumers another way to manage their expenditure.Adopting BNPL as a payment option is an increasing trend globally, the option is widely offered by retailers worldwide and online sites.In Malaysia, BNPL options are also appearing across different retail industries such as fashion, travel, electronics and gadgets – as an alternative payment method with zero-interest fee.But the availability of BNPL services has raised concerns that many consumers may be caught in this new debt trap in the long term.Therefore, when paying with a BNPL service, consumers should plan their shopping and evaluate if the item they intend to buy is a “need” or a “want, ” and spend wisely according to their preferences and budget.They should also find out more about the different BNPL options available and decide what would work best for their respective financial situations.What is PayLater?PayLater by Grab is the latest payment option that allows eligible consumers to purchase and spread their payments to manage their cash flow.Under this latest feature, consumers have a more flexible payment option:This means consumers can shop online now and choose to pay next month or in four monthly instalments. For instance, instead of paying RM2,000 for an electronic device, shoppers can split the bill into four monthly-instalments with no interest charged.Why PayLater?Completely interest-free and with no extra fees when you pay on time.A whole range of features, like auto deduct bills, to help you stay on top of all your spending.Can be used for your Grab spending too, to consolidate monthly Grab spends into one bill and pay next month.No upfront costs.Therefore, through PayLater, consumers can shop for things they need and want like electronic gadgets, clothes, baby milk powder and kitchen appliances in a more transparent manner, while prioritising privacy and security to avoid any risk of fraudulent transactions.Some of the ways Grab helps to protect consumer’s wallets is through a 6-digit pin code, partnerships with globally recognised security systems with award winning fraud detection tools which is complemented with a strong in-house fraud and security team that adopts robust processes and customised algorithms to prevent and detect fraud. Grab has also set up a safety centre in the app to educate and keep consumers updated on how their personal information and wallets are protected.Is BNPL for everyone?It depends. While BNPL is a convenient option for consumers, it is important to exercise discretion on when to utilise it. Some key things to consider before any purchase:Do I need this, or want it?Can I afford this even with an instalment plan?Have I bought anything else in installments?BNPL can help you get that sofa you really want, but deciding if it is within the monthly budget even with BNPL, is essential. In short, BNPL services like PayLater can be considered as a budget management tool to reduce total liabilities!Conclusion, BNPL services aren’t all that bad, especially when we understand what the options are, and how it fits into our lifestyles.For more information on PayLater by Grab, visit https://www.grab.com/my/finance/pay-later/\n",

      "IN increasingly convoluted times and a perpetually evolving world, communication has become – more than ever – an important part of society.Monash University Malaysia’s Master of Communications and Media Studies (MCMS) co-ordinator Dr Tan Meng Yoe (pic) provides insights into the programme and relevance of communications and media studies in an increasingly complex world:“Communications is more than what is presented to us. We are inundated with media content from various sources, both solicited and unsolicited.“Looking beyond the noise, we must find out what’s really going on. It is in this process of inquiry where important critical thinking skills are developed. In news, we have to ask: whose agenda is prioritised, how stories are framed, what version of reality is laid out for us, who’s behind it, and whether it is useful or dangerous.“These are not easy questions, but with some training, they’re not impossible to answer either.“This can be applied to all avenues of communication. The key is to look beyond the obvious, and identify the contexts, structures and processes that make communication effective – or ineffective.”Thinking beyond ourselves“An important aspect of honing communication skills is broadening our knowledge and appreciation of a world beyond the familiar. This is more crucial than we think it is.“For example, whenever an advertisement receives backlash for insensitivity towards particular cultures or people groups, it is important to realise it is a result of collective ignorance indicating a lack of broader understanding of other cultures.“To be fair, it is impossible to know everything there is to know about everyone, and mistakes do happen. As such, the solution is to develop an ‘others-centered’ approach to making decisions.“Students enrolled in the MCMS programme are exposed to cultural issues within Malaysia and abroad. Due to the diverse demographic of students in the university, students also get to learn and work with people of various backgrounds and nationalities, adapting to different styles.”Learning and producing knowledge“Accumulating knowledge and widening one’s perspective is important, but taking it to the next level, MCMS students conduct original research and contribute to the knowledge pool.“Enrolling in the MCMS degree helps you develop an in-depth, nuanced understanding of the changing global contexts of media and communication practices, and guides you through key issues affecting the communications industry today.“The programme trains you in research methods and theories, besides exploring the challenges that digital technologies, geopolitics and cross-cultural interactions pose in the Asian region.“You may also choose to put your classroom learning into practice through an internship as an elective. In the final semester, you can choose to work on an industry research project.“Alternatively, you can choose to write a dissertation, which represents an opportunity to pursue research that contributes significantly to your chosen field of study and can potentially lead to future doctoral research.”What MCMS offersThe MCMS is specifically crafted to cater to the needs of working professionals, especially in the media and communications industries.A key strength of the programme is the flexibility and support it provides to working students. Running in both full-time and part-time options, the course allows you to pick up a postgraduate qualification without compromising on career progression or work experience.In dialogue with your accomplished peers and lecturers, you will be encouraged to actively reflect and draw on your own work experiences to inform classroom discussions, and also strengthen your professional network.The MCMS degree offers you the opportunity to finely hone the critical thinking and collaborative skills indispensable to success in the industry, and broadens your understanding of cultural contexts. The specialised training will leave you well placed to lead in diverse fields. The career-focused programme uniquely blends an internationally recognised curriculum, collaborative learning from leading experts, independent research, and cutting-edge cultural insight to help you advance both personally and professionally.To learn more about postgraduate coursework and research programmes at Monash, join its Virtual Postgraduate Day on June 26 (2pm).

      "WHILE some of us have been fortunate enough to bask in the beauty that is Malaysia, if our natural wonders are not preserved, our future generations might not be able to enjoy the gorgeous mountain landscapes of Mount Kinabalu or the crystal clear waters of Tioman.So there is a growing need for us to protect the present for the future.“All my life, I’ve wanted to save endangered species, ” said National Geographic photographer Joel Sartore.“The way they look and ignite our imaginations, in every colour imaginable, is amazing. I believe great photographs, and the stories behind them, have the power to save species and the habitats they need to survive.“I’m doing all I can to bring awareness to the beauty and wonder right here on Planet Earth. Now, how about you?” he said.To this end, OPPO would like to invite you to capture the one thing you would like to preserve until 2121 and participate in its Malaysia Future Photography Contest from which ends June 25. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.Here are some photography know-how using the OPPO Find X3 Pro to get you started:1. Capturing detailsTaking close-ups is a wonderful way of showcasing the incredible details of nature – be it our national flower the hibiscus or interestingly shaped foliage like the venus flytrap – the microlens on the FindX3 Pro can magnify the object up to 60 times, capturing the intricacy not visible to the naked eye.2. Shoot in the best lightMost nature photography would be outside in natural light, and a specific time of day could make the photos more captivating. When the sun is low in the sky, the golden hour can create a magical moment, like dappled light through trees.3. Perfect exposure with AI Highlight videoGood photos require the right amount of exposure. Although one can prevent overexposure when taking the photo by tapping the screen to lock in the focus or swipe up or down to adjust the exposure, opting for an advanced phone could prevent post-production difficulties.The AI Highlight Video feature of the FindX3 Pro automatically switches between Ultra-Night Video and Live HDR – adapting to real-life light conditions, and allowing for worry-free videography.4. Ultra-wide angle lensHow to make your main subject stand out when photographing a cluttered or dark background? Lying on the ground or shooting from a very low angle is always worth trying!However, with the 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera of FindX3 Pro, the free-form surface lens adds complexity to the design and allows light directions to be controlled more precisely – producing zero distortion and correct temperature consistency images.5. Edit carefully with AI PaletteNow it's time for the most important part – the editing. It requires skill to find the right feel while using the right adjustments will enhance the image. The AI Palettes on the FindX3 Pro can learn the colour profile of any picture on your phone and turn it into a custom filter without the need of downloading third party apps – creating professionally edited images in just a few taps.6. Composition is importantGreat photographs always tell a story. Beautiful landscapes, animals or bodies of water all require great composition and a great one draws attention to your main subject. Try using empty space to emphasise your subject.When taking the smartphone for a spin, it's 30W AirVOOC wireless charging – that can fully charge the phone in just 80 minutes – coupled with 65W SuperVOOC 2.0 wired flash charging, would come in handy during breaks.Furthermore, its 0.35mm ultra-thin vapour chamber runs across the motherboard and battery areas, ensuring energy-efficient through encouraging heat dissipation.One of the first to be powered by Qualcomms – a new flagship Snapdragon 888 processor that supports 5G connectivity – the smartphone’s most exciting feature is the collaboration between OPPO and award-winning composer Hans Zimmer that made its ringtones, notifications and alarms specifically for the FindX3 Pro.Want to be in the running to win attractive prizes? Be sure to only use the hashtag #TheStarXOPPO to enter the competition.Interested to learn more about FindX3 Pro?

      "THE Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) is changing how we live, work and communicate.With this development that focuses heavily on interconnectivity, automation and real-time data, intelligent technologies are rapidly transforming almost every facet of our life.Cash is no longer king, as banknotes are now being replaced by digital currencies, while e-wallets and digital payments are the new forms of payment.These transformations are spurred by the application of financial technology (FinTech) which embodies IR4.0 technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics.FinTech has risen to challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic by delivering digital, secure, seamless user experiences.Research conducted by the University of Oxford found that accountants have a 95% chance of being impacted by AI technologies.This phenomenon also signifies that accounting and finance professionals have to embrace rapid transformation and adapt to technological advancements.There is a need to be equipped with the strategic knowledge and technical skills for them to stay through new job roles such as FinTech specialists and business data analysts within the industry.In the National Policy on Industry 4.0, FinTech is listed as one of the areas that require talents, and this need has been further fuelled by the Government’s plan to transform the country’s digital economy.Apart from the Government encouraging the masses to use e-wallets through the e-Tunai Rakyat under Budget 2020, Bank Negara announced in 2018 its plans to issue up to five licences for the operations of digital banking within the country to encourage industry players of the financial sector to put innovative technologies into use.Hence, the need for talents in FinTech who possess the essential financial fundamental knowledge as well as the ability to apply technological know-hows in traditional financial services has become even more critical.The APU advantage – infusing IR4.0 into ProgrammesAs one of Malaysia’s highest rated Premier Digital Tech Universities that established its own IR4.0 strategy, Asia Pacific University of Technology and Innovation (APU) has formed an ecosystem that facilitates the delivery of IR4.0-relevant programmes infusing the following technologies:As part of this ecosystem, FinTech education is integrated into the accounting, banking and finance disciplines, powered by concepts and applications of blockchain technology, Robo advisory, FinTech governance and risk management, digital currencies and cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding.All students under APU’s accounting, banking and finance programmes are exposed to the essentials of FinTech through specially-designed FinTech modules, to ensure that they are not alienated by the rapid transformation happening around the financial sector when they graduate.Pioneering FinTech programmesFor school leavers and future IT professionals, APU offers Malaysia’s first academic programme in FinTech – the Bachelor of Banking of Finance (Hons) with a specialism in Financial Technology, in addition to the BSc (Hons) Information Technology with a specialism in Financial Technology - FinTech.With the recent launch of the Master of Finance with a specialism in FinTech postgraduate programme, career professionals can now stay relevant and keep up with cutting edge disruptive technologies, which are prevalent within the financial sector.APU’s FinTech education was established together with the industry.The first FinTech academic degree in Malaysia offered by APU was built in collaboration with SuperCharger, Asia’s leading FinTech accelerator through an memorandum of agreement inked in 2018. It was aimed to leverage on local opportunities as well as to address the talent needs of Malaysian FinTech and banktech institutions that are facing a talent shortage.Career and Internship Opportunities in FinTechAPU also became the first and only university to sign a pact with the FinTech Association of Malaysia (FAOM) in March 2020.This new partnership opens a whole window of opportunities as APU’s FinTech students are now exposed to career and internship opportunities with over 80 members of FAOM, which include leading banks, financial institutions and FinTech platforms.Industry-focused FinTech activities are set to take place at APU in collaboration with the member companies of FAOM, providing students with relevant industry exposure even before they graduate from university.Industry experts from FAOM will also provide inputs in enhancing the programme to comprise key areas of FinTech, namely digital currencies, blockchain technologies, crowdfunding, Robo-advisory and entrepreneurial finance.According to the latest Annual Graduate Tracer Study by the Higher Education Ministry, 100% of APU graduates were employed upon graduation. This is a significant symbol of APU’s success and pride in nurturing professionals for global careers.APU School of Accounting and FinanceAPU’s School of Accounting and Finance is headed by Prof Dr Nafis Alam – the only one from Malaysia and one of six from the Asia Pacific region – to be featured in the top 100 social media influencers shaping the conversation in the FinTech.Prof Nafis, who has recently published a book on FinTech and Islamic finance, has extensive engagement with the industry and FinTech circle which will further boost the delivery of the programme.\n",

      "MORE than ever, companies must heed the pressing call to go beyond borders to seek opportunities within markets that possess strong potential for growth.Despite uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated economic repercussions, overseas markets such as Asia remain key to growth.As trade tensions between the United States (US) and China continue, companies are eyeing countries in Southeast Asia to establish or expand their sourcing, selling or operations within the next six to 12 months.In addition, positive progress for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will eliminate tariffs on 91% of goods and introduce rules on investment and intellectual property to promote free trade, enable wider market access and in turn, fuel an increase in trade volumes within the Asian trade corridor.According to Standard Chartered’s Borderless Business study, Malaysia is ranked as the second most favourable country in the region for European and US companies, having attracted RM81.9bil in foreign direct investment for 2021 thus far, as compared to RM64.2bil in 2020.That said, Standard Chartered Malaysia’s corporate, commercial and institutional banking client coverage head Mak Joon Nien highlights a shift in the key priorities and concerns of corporations when entering new markets.He shared, “In the past, sourcing funding and managing liquidity, as well as managing foreign exchange risks, would be key concerns. What’s interesting is that we’re now seeing understanding regulations and building relationships with suppliers and supply chain logistics as emerging priorities.The survey revealed that 35% of all the survey’s respondents cite understanding regulations as the number one challenge, while also listing working capital optimisation as a key concern.“A lot of businesses are challenged by market regulations, so you do get a lot of situations where they have an under-optimised balance sheet and there’s a lot of trapped cash in their export markets. Also, a real risk of liquidity impact from the failure of supply chains, which the pandemic has really amplified,” he added.To succeed internationally thus requires expert navigation of both local and international cross-border challenges that have been further complicated by the pandemic.In this regard, financial institutions (FIs) with a global presence can play a facilitating role in easing access to unfamiliar markets and alleviating such challenges their clients face.It is crucial for businesses to have a banking partner that understands global regulations and challenges, not just what’s happening domestically. FIs can help to fund international growth amid market volatility and liquidity constraints,As the only international bank present in all 10 Asean countries with presence in two-thirds of the Belt and Road markets, Standard Chartered is able to appreciate the nuances and diversity of the local markets that it plays in and is thus able to provide its clients with a ‘one bank’ experience through ease of access to expertise, products and services worldwide.This is invaluable for companies looking to expand across geographical borders, as they can take advantage of its global network, while leveraging the bank’s lending products and other innovative finance solutions to execute complex international operations.In doing so, Standard Chartered helps local companies - or those interested to expand into Malaysia - grow their footprint and engage in trade in new markets they have set their sights on, by providing end-to-end solutions for efficient capital transmission and reducing the cost of managing funds.The bank also helps connect clients with the relevant local government bodies to navigate the regulatory landscape in new markets, leveraging its expertise to help clients unlock trapped cash in new markets and working with them on solutions to digitalise their supply chains.As for advice to businesses keen to build resilience, Mak stressed the importance of digitalisation, particularly the use of blockchain, big data and analytics in boosting efficiency, creating wealth, as well as increasing security of trade and overcoming fraud.The pandemic has also strengthened focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) elements, as companies that have adopted good ESG practices have proven to be resilient in times of crisis.“The corporate landscape as we know it has changed dramatically. Digitalising and complying with ESG are critical to organisations moving forward and these two elements are here to stay.“In an increasingly borderless world, businesses need to understand [current and future] trends and threats in order to recognise opportunities,” he concluded.\n",

      "COMPUTER engineers are the drivers behind many of the innovations in technology today, from apps on mobile devices and computers to the latest computer platforms.And the first step towards a career in computer engineering begins at Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP).Existing at the crossroads of computer science and electrical engineering, computer engineers have been behind many, if not all, technological advancements of the computer age.From computers, the Internet and smart phones to the technologies that are driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0) such as Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, autonomous systems and machine learning, computer engineers have made their presence felt.Although computer engineers have been around for a long time, in the past their role would have entailed the designing of computers from scratch, says UTP Bachelor of Computer Engineering programme leader Dr Patrick Sebastian.Patrick says computer engineers today design systems that use computing technology from large-scale computers to the very small-scale microprocessors or microcontrollers.“In everything that’s happening in the world right now, for example technologies relating to IR 4.0 or IoT, the engineers who are driving these are computer engineers, or rather the engineers with the specialisation or interest in computer systems.“They are the ones who utilise the various computing technologies and the communication that happens between the technologies,” he says, adding that computer engineers are behind many of the digital innovations, in particular app development.“Take for example, the MySejahtera app, which is used to manage the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak in Malaysia. It has the ability to capture the image of a QR code, then translates that image into necessary information such as the location and time of the image capture.“It then transfers that information to a centralised database where it gets processed, stored and hopefully then, be used to track and trace those who have been in close contact with infected people.“So, that’s one of the few very exciting and readily available examples of where computer engineers are contributing their expertise,” he adds.Computer engineers, he explains, are in high demand.“They can work in any industry from manufacturing, electronics and computer systems to IT fields because they understand how hardware works. They have one foot in the electrical and electronics field where it’s primarily circuits, schematics, hardware, and the other foot in programming languages.Patrick elaborated that these engineers have the synthesis of two worlds, both of hardware and software, and that they understand the underlying electronics that happen along with it.“They understand the underlying firmware and how to connect hardware to software to make things run a little bit better.”Computer engineering, he continues, would be an attractive career proposition for students with an interest in programming, apps development, and those with an inclination to building circuits or IoT devices.UTP introduced its computer engineering in 2016 as there is a need for this field in the near future in developing countries like Malaysia.The priority is to ensure that the undergraduates are equipped with strong foundational skills that can be applied to emerging technological trends.“We take a different approach from other computer engineering programmes in that we approach it from the ground up,” Patrick mentions.“So, students learn from the very small to the large server-based systems. When we started the programme five years ago, our approach was to instill in them a maker culture so that they could build circuits and systems from scratch.“To do that, they need knowledge in basic computer systems, basic embedded systems or microcontroller systems, and we started to expose students to emerging trends such as big data analytics as well as data visualisation.“We are now in the midst of enhancing the curriculum to prepare for the next five years. With the next iteration of the programme, we are slowly changing the focus to incorporate artificial intelligence into embedded systems, and explore its connection to large and small systems,” he affirms.Basic skills and industry exposureStudents at UTP are also equipped with skills in various programming languages. These open-source programming languages include C, C++, Java, Python and R, which is the programming language for big data analytics.“We expose students to microcontrollers, like Raspberry Pi (good for software applications), Arduino (that make hardware projects simple), as well as the chips and architecture of ARM,” describes Patrick.“We do this because ARM is becoming a worldwide standard - many devices run on ARM, for example mobile devices like the iPhone. So, we give them that kind of exposure.”Undergraduates also benefit from the Computer Engineering programme’s collaborations with UTP’s Centre for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research (CISIR), which is focused on medical imaging and video surveillance among others.“So, we try to link the programme with some of the research undertaken at CISIR research.”Patrick relates that undergraduates also benefit from projects relevant to the needs of industry and community.Students hone their skills in systems integration through IoT-based projects such as for smart farming, for instance, he adds.“We want our students to also be able to handle an entire infrastructure, from the capturing of data to its transfer to a larger system,” he says, adding that one of the projects currently being undertaken is an improvement to the MySejahtera app.Students are integrating sensor information and sensor technology with the hand phone, and developing their own dashboards to display the data for tracking, so that close contacts of a Covid-19 positive case can be tracked and traced quickly.UTP’s seven-month Student Industrial Internship Programme, its state-of-the-art labs, a multinational campus, and internationally recognised academic staff also set the university apart from other institutions of higher learning.The university is ranked 70th in the QS Asia University Rankings 2021 and also has a high ratio of international community among its staff and students.This offers students a unique global intellectual and cultural experience.For more information on UTP’s computer engineering programme, visit www.utp.edu.my\n",
