      "Asean+\n",
      "ERIC NG\n",
      "Beijing has given the green light for the formation through merger of a central government-controlled electricity transmission and distribution equipment giant, as part of a reform of industry and state-owned enterprises to drive efficiency.The move, which involves the consolidation of XJ Group and six units under dominant power distributor State Grid Corporation of China, will create a company with more than 100 billion yuan (US$15.5 billion) in assets according to state media reports.Some of the companies make products and supply software that enables the automation of power grid management, which enhances the distribution system’s capacity and flexibility to absorb intermittent renewable energy. This will help China meet its net zero carbon emissions goal by 2060 and fight climate change.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.“Stripping out the noncore businesses of State Grid and enhancing the competitiveness of the entire sector is a big topic under China’s power system reform,” said Dennis Ip, head of utilities and renewables research at Daiwa Capital Markets. “[This drives the company to] focus more on power grid operation, power supply, power trading and dispatch, and the construction of transmission and distribution projects.”The latest restructuring involves its distribution equipment businesses, which will result in the establishment of a yet-to-be named company under the supervision of the central government. It will absorb China XD Group and six State Grid units – XJ Group Corporation, Ping Gao Group, Shandong Electrical Engineering and Equipment Group, Jiangsu Nari Group Hengchi Electrical Equipment, Jiangsu Nari Turbostar Electric and Chongqing Nari-Bori Transformer.“As informed by XJ Group, and upon approval by the State Council, it is agreed that XJ Group will be merged with companies including China XD Group,” Hebei province-based XJ Electric said in a statement to Shenzhen’s bourse on Wednesday.Shanghai emissions contracts to start trading in July, using market prices to drive towards targetXJ Group is a provider of automation and grid management solutions. China XD is a Xian, Shaanxi province-based maker best known for its high-voltage switches, transformers and insulators. Henan province-based Ping Gao makes switch gear and circuit-breakers and Shandong Electrical is China’s largest power transmission equipment maker, focusing on transformers, towers, cables and wires. The three Nari units belong to State Grid and have different product focuses.Beijing embarked almost two decades ago on a “big-bang” reform with the break-up of former power behemoth State Power Corporation into five generation firms and two distribution outfits to drive efficiency and cut industry costs.State Grid, the larger of the two distribution firms, has been asked to gradually spin out its noncore operations – including some power plants – to promote a fairer and more competitive industry landscape.Non-fossil fuel capacity will soon surpass coal power’s, though much of it remains unused“By legally unbundling the electrical equipment makers from State Grid, it is probably easier for the regulators to verify the cost of investing and maintaining the transmission and distribution assets owned by State Grid, [which will facilitate] transmission and distribution tariffs setting,” said Lucas Zhang Liutong, director of WaterRock Energy Economics. “It will also provide a more robust market structure for fair competition to supply equipment and services to State Grid via competitive tendering processes.”However, Beijing is asking State Grid’s equipment makers to merge with its domestic competitor XJ Group, which may actually reduce competition in the domestic market, which is expected to grow substantially as huge grid investment is needed to absorb the fast-growing renewable energy output, he said.“My best guess is that the merger is to create a big equipment maker and service provider that can compete well in the overseas market, especially in nations targeted by Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative,” Zhang added.Shanghai’s new national carbon emissions trading platform unveils trading rules, sets stage for launchLittle financial data has been publicly disclosed by the groups that will be merged. However, four of their listed units – XJ Electric, Henan Pinggao Electric, China XD and Shaanxi Baoguang Vacuum Electric Apparatus – reported a combined revenue of 16.6 billion yuan, a net profit of 750 million yuan and total assets of 76.6 billion yuan in the first half of this year, according to stock exchange filings.More from South China Morning Post:China’s carbon neutral goal: Beijing sets ambitious hydropower storage goal to bolster wind, solar energy growthChina’s carbon neutral goal: Non-fossil fuel capacity will soon surpass coal power’s, though much of it remains unusedChinese utilities’ ambitious renewable energy targets raise questions about costs, deliveryChina should stop building more coal power plants soon, climate change think tank says ahead of Glasgow summitFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021.\n",

      "KULAI: The Finance Ministry is working together with other ministries in finding solutions to the rising cost of chicken feed including the possibility of providing subsidies to the chicken breeders.Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz stated that the government was aware of the resulting price increase in chicken meat and would seek a fair way to stabilise its pricing.\"The government is aware of these issues and the Finance Ministry together with the Agriculture and Food Industries Ministry and the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry will go through all solutions to stabilise the chicken price for the food industry.\"Any decision would need to be looked into first in terms of the impact to the breeders and all industries involved in the food industry chain and most importantly the effect to the consumers, which is our main concern,\" he said.He said this when met by reporters after visiting the freshwater fish breeding centre in Bukit Batu, here on Saturday (Sept 18).The visit was part of his two-day working visit programme to Johor on Sept 18 and Sept 19.Tengku Zafrul said that the Agriculture and Food Ministry was expecting a temporary price hike of poultry meat due to the unstable demand caused by the reopening of the economic sector.\"Whatever the suggestion is, we will take it through with the ministries involved before coming out with any solution,\" he explained.Earlier, it was reported that a discussion will be carried out with the Finance Ministry as well as the Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry to search for a long-term solution to stabilise chicken prices.Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi said while there were no plans to implement price control on the produce, for now, the ministry might enforce this if prices at every level of the distribution chain continued to go up unreasonably.Currently, the price of poultry meat was capped along with a list of other essential food items during festive seasons.\n",

      "WHEN Ellice Ng, 38, quit her studies in software engineering, she didn’t think that she’d come back to it in any way. The jargon was a challenge for her and she just wasn’t very into it.Instead, Ng went on to chart a path in communications and founded her own public relations company. She found considerable success in the industry despite starting off broke.“I didn’t have many friends and I only had RM500 in my account. But I wanted to give it a try. I got through the six months trial. It was tough, but it eventually got better.”But as fate would have it, she was drawn back into the technology field about five years ago following an encounter with Tim Hendricks – her future business partner and now husband – who was in Malaysia to train people in Mendix Low-Code.Mendix is a low-code application development platform.Low-code is a software development approach that requires little to no coding to build applications and processes. Instead, it uses visual interfaces with basic logic and drag-and-drop capabilities.This time, her interest piqued.“I got interested in low-code and did my own research. I found out that it was quite big in the US and in Europe but not in Asia. But it was also because Mendix did not focus specifically on Asia. So I thought of the opportunities that were available here.“It’s a growing industry worth about US$20bil (RM83.4bil) in the US and Europe. And China started using low-code in 2014,” she shares with a degree of enthusiasm.She took some time researching the potential market for a low-code platform in Malaysia and the region and in 2017, with funds taken out from her wedding budget, they kickstarted Orangeleaf Consulting.The company offers digital innovation services, specialising in Mendix Low-Code, to firms looking to digitalise their systems.Ng recalls that there was hardly any conversation in the market around low-code at the time and it was a challenge educating local tech talents on its application. They were also frequently turned away as companies were generally unsure about the concept of automating their operations then.However, Ng was convinced that low-code is the way to go to help companies with their digitalisation process.And given that it requires little coding, it was possible to build a system 10 times faster and with seven times fewer resources. For example, Orangeleaf built 15 applications for a local client with only two people on the project last year.“In a company, different departments will be using different software and they usually need to manually consolidate the data across. I believe Mendix can help them close that gap. And because we are a consulting firm, not a software house, we start off by helping clients build a digitalisation strategy before selling them the idea of using low-code.”Orangeleaf’s early clients signed on with them when they were shown the potential returns on investment. For its first customer, it built an entire system in two months, with three weeks of testing, at half the cost.Ng adds that the company does not offer off-the-shelf applications, preferring, instead, to help clients customise their systems.“It’s the build versus buy approach. If you buy something off the shelf, it’s harder to integrate that into your system. If you are a smaller company, buying off the shelf might work because it’s not something you want to bother too much with.“But if you have your own special features and you want to customise and build your own pipeline to enable the company to build systems internally, then we can help you (do that faster with low-code).“Clients need to look at what systems they can’t roll out fast enough to meet the market. And if they want to expedite that, they can leverage low-code. Mendix is all about getting the product out as soon as possible,” she says.While off-the-shelf applications may enable clients to immediately plug-and-play, she notes that building a system offers companies with more sustainable results.She also emphasises that Orangeleaf does not do long-term contracts, which are a norm in the software industry. Their projects are completed in days or months.“We come in to help them with complicated projects. However, in the long run, they can have their own internal people to build systems. Once the internal team familiarises themselves with the low-code environment, they can further build the systems later. This also helps them build their internal digital workforce.“Our vision here is to enable clients to digitise business by themselves. I really hope that Malaysia will one day be able to digitise things in the ecosystem that works, whereby nobody needs to go through a manual process in between two digital processes.”Given its flexibility in building various applications with low-code, the company does not focus on any one industry and serves clients in various sectors including manufacturing, construction and logistics.Ng adds that there is no limit to the number of solutions they can build. Notably, the company has seen tremendous growth of some 200% since the start of the pandemic as businesses look into every avenue to digitise their operations at the fastest pace and with the lowest cost possible.Enquiries from the local market have also picked up substantially with the growing acceptance of low-code.Currently, the bulk of its business comes from overseas markets like the Philippines, Japan, Germany and Australia.Correspondingly, the majority of their customer base are larger firms. SMEs, including startups, make up about 20% of Orangeleaf’s business.While there is plenty more that the company can do in the digitalisation space with rising demand, Ng wants to also look at the wider needs of the ecosystem.“After three years in the market, I noticed a high demand for low-code talent in Europe. People in Europe are looking to us for talent as we have the cost advantage. So our goal is to build a talent hub for low-code.“To have a healthy ecosystem, we need to build the supply of talent. So once our business stabilises, we want to roll out an academy in Malaysia to offer short courses on low-code by 2022,” she says.She adds that in the near term, more and more enterprises in the US and Europe will be using low-code given its accessibility.This may also encourage more women to join the tech workforce.“Low-code is very different from traditional programming. You need both the business and tech perspectives, and in this sense, I think women are better at seeing a balanced picture. But men and women have their own strengths and they actually balance out the development ecosystem quite well.“In the long run, I do see an increase in interest and I do encourage more women to explore tech and to take their learning into their own hands.”The return to tech has been unexpected, but Ng notes that it has also been a lot more interesting.“It has been a learning curve. But I do find IT more fun these days and I want to know more. I see tech very differently now. It is so much more incorporated into so many aspects of our lives. Technology has transformed our lifestyle,” she says.The road ahead is certainly promising for Orangeleaf as digitalisation trends continue to increase.For Ng, who has had a rough past year following a diagnosis of ovarian cancer, it is also a time of coming back on track and taking the opportunities ahead with gusto.“Nothing in life is easy. Everything you do is about the decisions you make and then going through the learning curve.“And every obstacle is an opportunity to grow. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it is that every status is not permanent.“I was an orphan. But now I see myself as a businesswoman and an entrepreneur. It takes a lot of perseverance, grit and patience.“If you learn the basics, you will go somewhere. And another piece of advice I can give is to not compare your life with others.“I overcame a hard life with gratitude and by picking my fights.”\n",

      "Seventy-eight-year-old Amy has Alzheimer’s disease, and she is cared for at home by her daughter Azlina. Her husband and domestic maid help as well.“I feel a deep sadness for the fate of my mum, but as a family, we’ve come to accept it as part of life. Mum is now totally dependent on us and she’s no longer able to communicate verbally,” says Azlina.“But we’re fortunate in some ways because she has been very gentle even in her most difficult moments and she still is. The hardest part was mainly handling our own emotions,” she adds.Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative brain disease caused by complex brain changes following brain cell damage. It leads to dementia symptoms that gradually worsen over time, with the most common early symptom being trouble remembering new information because the disease usually impacts the part of the brain associated with learning first.As it advances, the symptoms become more severe and include disorientation, confusion and behavioural changes. Eventually, speaking, swallowing and walking also become difficult.There is no way to prevent, cure or even slow down Alzheimer’s disease, especially when it’s diagnosed at a late stage.Caring for a loved oneAccording to Azlina, there are many things to consider when a family member is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease or any other type of dementia, things that she has learnt in the course of caring for her own mother.Firstly, it is a time of learning and adjustment for the whole family.“As with any chronic medical condition, everyone has to go through a period of trials and tribulation as we adjust and learn,” she says.“Since as family members, we’re taking on the bulk of the responsibility for caregiving, it’s important to educate ourselves about the disease and understand its effect on the person, as well as how the disease will progress so that we can prepare ourselves psychologically if not it will become very difficult later,” she adds.There is also the question of who will take on the responsibility of caregiver.“We’re a close-knit family so caring for mum personally was a natural choice. But if a parent-child relationship had issues before the onset of dementia, then caregiving can be difficult because both are adjusting to changing roles and needs. In those situations, it’s important to get help from others,” she says.When caring for the person with dementia at home, “dementia proofing” the home is necessary, says Azlina.Some ways of dementia proofing one’s home include: removing carpets or anything that can cause trips or falls because the person’s visual perception changes, installing handrails for bathrooms/toilets, making sure the bedroom and bathroom doors can’t be locked from the inside or that the key is easily accessible in case it does get locked, hiding the keys to the front and back doors of the house at night, and ensuring the gas tank is off when the kitchen is not in use.A lifestyle change with new activities would also be in order when a family member has dementia.“Understanding the disease is important and helps to put everything that happens into context. Find simple but meaningful activities to do together according to your family member’s changing ability. If the person is no longer able to engage in certain activities that they used to enjoy, then find new activities that the whole family can do together with them,” she says.Pandemic challengesAccording to Azlina, the pandemic and different stages of lockdowns hasn’t had much of an effect her mother since she’s at a very advanced stage of the disease and cared for at home (she doesn’t go out much).“But during her early stages, it might have been more difficult if she had to go through the pandemic then.”“This is because dementia patients are often restless and outdoor activities help to stimulate them, pass time and prepare their body for rest,” she says.“So, it’s especially difficult if they can’t go out and all the responsibility of ‘entertaining’ them rests on the caregivers within the walls of the home,” she explains.The pandemic also poses many challenges for persons with Alzheimer’s disease or other types of dementia who are still mobile and independent.“For some, the sight of masked people may cause them to feel scared or anxious.“If they’re outside and hungry, it’s not easy to just go to a restaurant and dine in during the MCO. So, they might have to wait and hunger is a major behavioural trigger.“Early closure of shops and pharmacies would also make it difficult for any emergency purchases like food, diapers or medicine,” she says.But one of the most difficult challenges would be not understanding the SOPs, especially if there isn’t a family member or carer to help them mediate any misunderstandings with members of the public, such as the need to queue or socially distance.“Individuals with early to mid-stage dementia who are still fairly independent may have issues with technology when they have to check in using the MySejahtera app every time they enter a shopping mall or other venue, and scan their temperature,” says Azlina.“If they’re not able to go out – like during the MCOs – the loss of social interaction is also likely to make them feel isolated and depressed,” she says.But despite all the negatives, Azlina says it’s important for caregivers to see things through positive eyes, and take things one day at a time.“Know your own limits as a caregiver and that it’s okay if things don’t go well all the time. Still celebrate the small victories and find humour in the simple things,” she advises.Being part of a support group so that one doesn’t feel so alone or overwhelmed in one’s journey as a caregiver is also important.“Talk to others, especially those who are also caregivers, about your feelings, and find a support group,” she says.For those based in Petaling Jaya and its surrounding districts, there is a support group based at the Atria Alzheimer’s Disease Community Centre.There is also a caregivers support group handled by the Alzheimer’s Disease Foundation Malaysia.During the pandemic, the support continues online through social media and networks such as WhatsApp and Facebook.“For example, in our support group, there is a chair yoga instructor called Janet who has been giving weekly online classes during the movement control order,” she says.“There are quite a number of smaller, more intimate support groups that exist too, usually around friends who are caregivers and living within the same area. So as a caregiver, it’s important to know you’re not alone in this and to get support,” concludes Azlina.\n",
