      "PETALING JAYA: A total of 3,330,436 Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered under the country’s National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme as at June 3.The vaccination rate has been rising for the past few weeks after getting off to a slow start and on May 27 the number of jabs given daily breached the 100,000 mark, with 107,340 doses administered.The vaccination programme started on Feb 24 with a target of covering at least 80% of the country’s adult population.The vaccination programme is being carried out in three phases.The first covers frontliners.The second which began on April 19 involves high-risk groups and those aged 60 and above.The rest of the Malaysian population aged 18 years and above will be vaccinated in the third phase, which is expected to start soon.Here’s how the states and federal territories are progressing:The following graph shows the percentage of Malaysia's population who have received at least one vaccine dose, versus others in Asean as well as South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and Taiwan.In terms of vaccine registrations, 12,584,422 people or 51.9% of Malaysia's population who are aged 18 and above have signed up as at June 2.There were significant spikes in registrations especially on May 2 - the first round of opt-ins for the AstraZeneca vaccine - and on May 26, when those below the age of 60 were allowed to book during the second round of opt-ins.The country recorded a total of 603,122 Covid-19 infections with 515,571 recoveries and 3,182 deaths as at June 4.Among Asean countries, Malaysia currently has the highest cumulative confirmed Covid-19 cases per million people, according to Oxford University's Our World in Data (OWID)website:In terms of Covid-19 deaths per million people among Asean countries, the OWID portal puts Malaysia third behind the Philippines and Indonesia as at June 3, 2021:One of the things health authorities and experts measure when trying to find out where things are headed is the infection’s reproduction number, called R0 (pronounced as “R naught”).The R value refers to the number of people that a person who has the coronavirus will infect.If the R value is 1 for example, it means that on average, one infected person will spread Covid-19 to one other individual.An R value higher than 1 means that the number of cases will increase.However, if the R value goes down, the disease will eventually stop spreading as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.Malaysia announced its first Covid-19 cases on Jan 25, 2020, involving three tourists who entered via Johor from Singapore on Jan 23.The number of cases then rose to 22 by Feb 16 last year, representing the first wave of cases.The second wave of cases began on Feb 27, 2020, followed by the third wave that began on Sept 20.The following is how the third wave of infections developed in each state and federal territory:\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The number of people in Malaysia infected with Covid-19 but who were only taken to hospital after dying of the disease is going up at an alarming rate.In May alone, we saw 123 deaths that the Health Ministry categorises as “brought in dead” (BID). The figure represents 47% of the 261 BID cases recorded in the country this year.Health experts said a detailed study needs to be done to find out why this happening, adding that the trend could be due to two possible factors.The first is that some people infected with Covid-19 did not take their initial symptoms seriously, only to face a rapid deterioration in their medical condition and as a result died before they could be taken to hospital.The second possible reason could be the widespread presence of more virulent variants of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes Covid-19.In any case, the experts said that the worrying trend underscores the importance of people closely monitoring themselves for any possible symptom and sticking to the standard operating procedure (SOP) such as social distancing and wearing masks when out, in order to better protect themselves.As at the end of May, Malaysia has recorded 2,796 Covid-19 deaths since the pandemic reached our shores last year, of which 293 or 10% were classified as BID.The majority of BID cases occurred in Sabah (29%), followed by Selangor (27.6%) and Kuala Lumpur (10.9%).While Sabah had more BID cases last year, this year saw Selangor recording the most number of such cases.In terms of age, most of the BID cases involved patients aged between 60 and 69 (24.2%), followed by those between 50 and 59 (20.5%) and the 70-79 age group (16%). The 30-39 age group made up 8.5% of the overall BID cases in the country.The youngest Covid-19 patient who was brought in dead, in Tawau Hospital on Nov 28,2020, was a four-year-old in Sabah.Most BID cases had a medical history of hypertension and diabetes. However, 31.7% or 93 of the cases did not have any record of medical illness.The Health Ministry said on May 28 that the rising number of BID cases involved three possible scenarios, with the first scenario comprising patients who did not undergo Covid-19 screening despite developing symptoms such as fever and cough.The second scenario involved confirmed Covid-19 patients who were found dead at home before they could be sent to a quarantine centre or hospital.\"Scenario three involves patients who experience the loss of sense of taste and fatigue but did not take these symptoms seriously. The patient only rested at home and after a few days, was found dead,\" the ministry said in a tweet.Universiti Malaya epidemiologist Prof Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud said the rise in Covid-19 patients who are brought in dead to hospitals may be due to several factors, including newer Covid-19 variants which are more virulent, resulting in a more rapid deterioration in the patient’s condition.Another possible reason that the infected person failed to seek proper medical attention quickly enough is that they brushed off their initial symptoms as a common cold or minor cough.\"Other factors may be due medical facilities being far away and not readily accessible, like in remote areas of Sabah and Sarawak,\" he added.In order to ensure infected persons receive the medical attention they need, Dr Awang Bulgiba stressed that a data analysis should be done to determine the type of patients who are likely to deteriorate.\"Factors that can predict disease progression may be modifiable but the correct analysis needs to be carried out to find out what those factors are,\" he said.Dr Awang Bulgiba also proposed that an epidemiological analysis be combined with genomic surveillance to prevent the spread of new undetected variants that will be a threat to the community.“Hardly 0.08% of virus samples are being sent for genome sequencing, ” he said, describing the figure as “dismal.”The medical condition of home-quarantined patients should be monitored more closely through the possible use of mobile applications that would allow the process to be done remotely.Dr Awang Bulgiba urged the government to ramp up vaccination efforts to between 300,000 to 500,000 doses per day.\"With half a million doses per day, the country can achieve herd immunity in just 100 days or within six months if we vaccinate at a rate of 300,000 doses per day.“However, the current rate is far below this number, so this is worrying,\" he added.Commenting on the increasing number of BID cases, Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman said a study involving animals in India has shown that the new coronavirus variant in that country is associated with more severe clinical manifestations.\"We are still studying the clinical data, but I believe the new strains of the virus may play a role in the deterioration of the symptoms,\" she said, adding that there is the possibility of multi-strains infections but should be proven by more research and clinical data.Dr Malina said that among the risk factors of developing severe Covid-19 and deaths are undiagnosed chronic diseases or medical illnesses that can lead to an immunocompromised patient (having an impaired immune system).\"Some of the factors include the person's compliance to put an effort to get and have the prescribed treatment, effort by the caretakers to help monitor the symptoms as well as the general attitude and practice towards SOP compliance,\" she said.She advised those who are infected to closely follow medical advice and to get help from others such as family members, neighbours or friends to keep tabs on them in case their condition worsens.Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy reiterated that delays in seeking medical attention, failure to recognise severe symptoms of Covid-19, and newer variants may have contributed to the rise in BID cases.\"Issues of getting quick access to healthcare especially in the remote interiors in Sabah and Sarawak may also be a factor,\" he said.Dr Subramaniam said proper assessments and monitoring are key to reducing BID cases, with those infected needing to be properly educated on the various Covid-19 categories to know if their symptoms are worsening from mild or moderate to severe.\"The CAC (Covid-19 assessment centre) would need to ensure more thorough assessments and the district health office would need to ensure all patients on home monitoring are checked on regularly.\"The Health Ministry must also be clear on when a patient should seek care at a hospital's emergency department,\" he said, adding that the patient's family or caregiver will need to be on alert to call in for medical attention if symptoms worsen.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Computer science graduate Muadz Halim normally tweets about football and Japanese manga, but when Israel attacked Palestine earlier this month, his focus expanded.The 23-year-old from Perak began to retweet and use pro-Palestine hashtags from early May, at a rate of 80 to 120 times each day.\"I hope that by doing this, I can at least raise awareness among my social media followers that the Palestinians are suffering and that we need to always support and show them solidarity.\"My greatest hope is that Palestine will be free and that there will be no more suffering,” said Muadz, who has racked up a total of 2,707 mentions and retweets on the topic.He is one of an army of local social media users actively spreading awareness on the topic, making Malaysians among the most prolific in the world in terms of expressing support for and solidarity with Palestine online, especially on Twitter.This is among the findings of an analysis by The Star which tracked the popularity of pro-Palestine hashtags among users of the social networking service.Social media monitoring software was used to search for 92 chosen keywords including popular hashtags and phrases that express support for and solidarity with Palestinians or which condemn Israel over its attacks.Most of the keywords were in English, and the majority of the social media posts tracked were on Twitter.The search found 31.26 million mentions by social media users from 193 countries over a one-month period from April 19 to May 19.Of the total, 1.18 million mentions came from Malaysians, making us the second most prolific, behind US-based social media users with 1.24 million mentions.Social media users in Pakistan came in third with 979,175 mentions, followed by people in Egypt (926,593) and India (858,704).Among the most popular hashtags mentioned or retweeted by Malaysians were #freepalestine, #savepalestine, #savesheikhjarrah, #gazaunderattack, #Israelterrorist and #Israelkoyak.Twenty-nine-year-old Syahmi Nazir, who has also been actively supporting Palestine on Twitter, expressed hope that it would help lead to action.Syahmi, who is known as @syahminamon on Twitter, posts five to seven tweets an hour on the issue in his free time, racking up a total 1,874 mentions on the topic since April 19.The 29-year-old entrepreneur who lives in Subang Jaya, Selangor, felt many people still lack an understanding of the extent of suffering in Palestine.\"We need to keep applying pressure and raise awareness until the people in power give Palestinians the basic rights they deserve, and uphold justice.”Student Nurul Aina Zulkarnaen from Terengganu said she spends her free time during the movement control order spreading awareness on the situation in Palestine in the hope that it might bring about positive change.Using the Twitter handle @callmeeyna, the 20-year-old has 1,041 pro-Palestine posts and hashtag retweets over the past month.\"I wish that the Palestinians will get freedom like what we have.“Their children have the right to a bright future and a peaceful life,” she said.Student Farah Aleeysha, who goes by @borahaedef7 on Twitter, said she retweets and posts 200 messages a day to show her support for Palestine, which she says is a sacred land for Muslims.\"Israel is showing its true colours but only a few countries are brave enough to stand up to it.\"By using my voice collectively with others, I can help create awareness on the atrocities and cruelty committed by Israel, and social media is helping us to achieve that,” said the 19-year-old.\n",

      "Suffering In SilenceHow the Pandemic is Affecting the Mental Health of Our ChildrenBY DIYANA PFORDTENNadia, a Form Five student, is the eldest among three siblings.Nadia is a composite character.She is drawn from descriptions by psychiatrists interviewed for this story, who were asked about the children – some as young as eight years old – in need of their help ever since the pandemic started.Adults are not the only people whose lives have been turned upside down by Covid-19.Children are also facing greater anxiety, depression and isolation due to school closures and sudden changes in their daily routines and interactions.Many are unable to cope but don’t know what to do and parents sometimes fail to notice that their children need help.The pandemic’s toll on the mental health of our school going children is a growing problem that parents and everyone in society need to pay more attention to, warn the experts.SOLS Health research and advocacy director Dr Arman Rashid said some of the mental health stressors experienced by children – exam stress, isolation from friends, anxiety about the future - are not unique to the pandemic but are escalated by it.SOLS Health research and advocacy director Dr Arman RashidDr Arman highlighted that the closure of schools means the lack of avenue for children to develop their socio-emotional needs besides fulfilling educational purposes.“Schools serve as an important support system for students with teachers and peers playing a role in their emotional wellbeing.“This important role of schools in the life of children was hampered during the pandemic. As a result, many children feel increasingly lonely, isolated and detached,” he said.Dr Arman pointed out the pandemic has also escalated uncertainty over future educational and employment plans, particularly for older students.“Generally speaking, all children have been affected by the pandemic but even more so for SPM/STPM students and those from B40 (bottom 40%) households,” he said, adding that burnout, exhaustion and anxiety over needing to perform well in exams escalated as students felt inadequately prepared.“The stress is higher for students from B40 families as many cannot get internet access, laptops or mobile devices for online classes, or access to devices. Many are also part of larger class sizes in school,” he said.Dr Arman highlighted that there are long-term implications of the pandemic for both mental health and education of students.“If students continue to face mental health stressors during this period, it can cause short-term and long-term problems in psychosocial functioning and day to day life, including academic performance, relationships, morale and others.“Though all children have been affected by the pandemic, coping is dependent on their own level of resilience and support system around them,” he said.Universiti Malaya Specialist Centre consultant psychiatrist Assoc Prof Dr Amer Siddiq Amer Nordin said he has been receiving a rising number of children between the age of eight to 12 years old who are in need of mental health support since the second movement control order.“Due to the pandemic, these children are learning online and parents who previously had control in terms of gadget time, now have very little control as it is the mandatory way of learning.“Kids are being exposed to higher degree of online time and we know that online time is a risk factor for online issues such as cyberbully,” he said.Universiti Malaya Specialist Centre consultant psychiatrist Assoc Prof Dr Amer Siddiq Amer NordinDr Amer noted that children, who lack understanding of the implication of their action, may resort to writing nasty things, photoshopping or calling names.“Because they were not taught on how to manage social media and have little understanding on how to regulate their emotions, these actions lead them to face emotional issues, mainly stress which then develops into depress mode.“Those without a support system will keep their problems to themselves to the extent that some develop depression and even harm themselves,” he said.Dr Amer highlighted that these children may display physical symptoms such as eating disorder, poor emotional control, deterioration in school performance or showing risk of self-harm.“To address this, parents need to teach their children what emotions are, name them and also validate them,” he said.Parents, added Dr Amer, need to bring their children for professional help if symptoms deteriorate as professional mental assessments can also reveal the child’s condition aggravated due to history of trauma, having divorced parents, medical comorbidities or drug or porn addiction.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), mental health conditions account for 16% of the global burden of disease and injury in people aged 10 to 19 years.“Half of all mental health conditions start by 14 years of age but most cases are undetected and untreated,” it said, adding that globally, depression is one of the leading causes of illness and disability among adolescents.WHO noted that the consequences of not addressing mental health and psychosocial development for children and adolescents extend to adulthood and limit opportunities for leading fulfilling lives.In Malaysia, the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2019 found that 424,000 children in the country were experiencing mental health problems.Dr Arman, who is also the former project manager of Humankind Buddy Bear, stressed on the need for children to have access to both formal and informal mental health support during the pandemic, including emotional support from teachers, parents and peers.“We must adopt a preventive approach, with parents and caregivers playing an important role in addressing emotional challenges faced by students.“Parents can help foster a supportive and positive environment for emotional expression and help-seeking at home.\"This involves listening and acknowledging feelings of children beyond meeting their physical needs,” he said.Parents and caregivers, said Dr Arman, are best placed to see early warning signs of mental health stressors, including connecting with mental health professionals if there is persistent distress.He also stressed that children also need more proactive involvement and supervision during online learning.“Emotional check-ins with children are very important. Parents need to look out for early warning signs like difficulties in concentration, frequent headaches, fatigue, irritability or sleep disruptions to offer emotional support.“If there are early responses, we can avoid mental health challenges from escalating into long-term conditions in most cases,” he said.If emotional distress persists and children show signs of intense hopelessness, social withdrawal, being overwhelmed, self-harm tendencies or thoughts despite support from parents or caregivers, Dr Arman encouraged parents to seek professional help.Acknowledging the shortage of mental health professionals, especially those specializing in supporting children, he said community stakeholders - parents, teachers, caregivers, social workers and others – need to be equipped with mental health skills and tools.“This has to go beyond general awareness to provide emotional support, assess needs and refer to formal resources if needed. In most cases, early interventions can prevent mental health conditions in the future.\"In the case of counselling, Dr Arman said there needs to be more of a focus on child-centred creative, expressive and play therapies in professional help, in addition to online support like Malaysia’s only child-dedicated helpline during the Covid-19 crisis, Buddy Bear, in helping children handle emotions and coping skills.“This is because children communicate differently than adults. This means we need to provide a range of services catering to children - psychosocial helplines, online platforms, peer support groups and professional help from counsellors and psychologists.“The bottom line is we need more mental health professionals specialising in supporting children,” he said, adding that inclusive access to mental health services is even more important for the B40 group and rural communities.According to data from 2018, there were 410 psychiatrists in our country with a national average of 1.27 psychiatrists per 100,000 population, which is much lower than the WHO's recommended ratio of one psychiatrist per 10,000 population.Dr Arman noted that SOLS Health-Thrive Well has an ongoing programme called Keluarga Akrab Mencapai Impian (KAMI)m which work with PPR communities to engage children and parents at the community level in preventing escalation of mental health challenges, improving relationships and developing emotional resilience.“SOLS Health-Thrive Well, with the support of Yayasan Hasanah and Ministry of Finance, is also offering the Jom Sembang project providing subsidised mental health care, particularly for B40 communities, including children,” he said.An English teacher at a school in Jerantut, who only wanted to be known as Farhan, said students, especially SPM candidates in the school he teaches in, were having a hard time coping with online learning due to poor internet connectivity.“We could only conduct lessons via WhatsApp where I would send pictures and voice note to explain the lesson.“Even then, only a few students would respond to the lessons and out of 20 children, only around four students would participate in the lessons and they are usually the same person,” he said.Farhan also said the students reported facing a lack of motivation, were preoccupied with housework or caring for their younger siblings, as well as a lack of supervision from parents.“When they return to physical classes, we will need to teach them from scratch. It was particularly challenging for SPM candidates who needed to catch up.“The higher-ups often push teachers to use Google Meet and advanced online learning tools but often neglect the accessibility of students in rural areas.“The fact is, there are many children who are left behind in their studies, face difficulties in online learning, as well as stress and isolation during the pandemic and this will definitely affect their future plans and to an extent,their emotional and mental health” he said.Those in need of help can contact Befrienders at befrienders.org.my/centre-in-malaysia or call 03-7627 2929; Talian Kasih at 15999 (24 hours); and Lifeline (Mandarin) at 03-4265 7995.Story: Diyana PfordtenIllustrations: Foo Chern HwanEditing: Razak AhmadVisualisation: Sim Leoi LeoiTOPBuilt with Shorthand\n",

      "TOUGH times call for strong characters, especially if you are a teacher trying to educate students living in hard-to-reach areas during a pandemic.Though schools had to close when the movement control order (MCO) began, education was not brought to a halt.It is easy for a teacher to teach when the conditions are ideal - the classroom is comfortable, there are enough tables and chairs, every student has a book, stationery and can they see the board clearly.But in rural schools, more often than not, the situation is far from ideal. Little, if at all, is readily available.The National Union of the Teaching Profession (NUTP) secretary-general Harry Tan said it was passion and responsibility that drove these teachers to do everything within their power to carry out their duty.With the closure of schools, teachers had to get creative and find novel ways to deliver their lesson modules to their students, he told The Star.Some of those who taught in the interiors would travel by jeep, boat and foot to reach their students at their homes to give modules and learning packs.Others would brave bad weather to personally hand deliver assignments to their charges.Click on the icon on the pictures below to view each teacher's storyEven though these were not as effective to teach compared to face-to-face learning, these teachers believed that this would be enough to keep the students from missing out.Sabah Teachers' Union (STU Sabah) vice-president Susan Atau said online learning was a “huge challenge” for her and her rural students last year.She said her students did not have any digital devices and, coupled with an “extremely hopeless” Internet connection, she could not finish the syllabus in time.To help those without any means of learning virtually, Susan printed notes and modules that was distributed to her students.“Tender loving care is what drives me and all other teachers to do this for our students, ” she added.Educationist Datuk N. Siva Subramaniam said these teachers deserved to be honoured for the great lengths they went through.“While we recognise the sacrifices and contribution of these teachers, we must never forget that they too have families to take care of, ” added the former NUTP secretary-general, Cuepacs president and human rights commissioner.He said the nation owes its development to the dedication of these teachers who would be based in schools miles away from their families.Some, he added, would even be placed in schools without basic amenities.Based on data from the Education Ministry, there are 671 schools located in rural areas in Malaysia. The majority being in Sabah (285) and Sarawak (330).This is out of more than 10,000 schools in the country.Unsurprisingly there are no rural schools in the federal territories - Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan.Though nothing much can be done about the locality of these schools, there is concern that the students here are once again going to be badly affected when home-based teaching and learning (PdPR) makes a comeback after the Hari Raya holidays.“I think that urban schools would be fine conducting PdPR but the rural schools will have problems, ” said Subramaniam.However, he pointed out that all teachers faced problems implementing PdPR as they were not trained to teach in that manner.He added that the government should quickly provide proper laptops and a mobile data plan to these teachers to enable them to conduct, not just PdPR, but also prepare modules to be sent to their students again.Universiti Utara Malaysia School of Education senior lecturer Dr Muhammad Noor Abdul Aziz said teachers are struggling to make learning happen for their charges.\"Given that Malaysian learners are divided into two categories - urban and rural – issues like Internet connection, possession of gadgets, and continuous learning support seem to be a major hindrance among learners in rural areas while their counterparts in the urban area are burdened with homework.\"Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The employment disparity between young men and women in the country is alarming.More young Malaysian women are eager to join the workforce, have clearer career goals, and are more academically qualified, but they face higher unemployment rates.This worrying trend was identified in a study by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute titled “Unemployment among Malaysia’s Youth: Structural Trends and Current Challenges”, authored by its senior fellow and Malaysia Studies Programme co-coordinator Lee Hwok Aun.The paper, which was published on June 18,2020, addresses several factors affecting youth unemployment, and substantial gender disparity was one of them.While diverse reasons affect employment opportunities among young Malaysian women, various bodies and non-governmental organisations say marriage-related reasons and cultural aspects play a vital role.Malaysian Employers Federation (MEF) executive director Shamsuddin Bardan said some women stop working after marriage.They cite reasons that include family responsibilities, such as having to look after their children and aged parents, he added.“Even after their children no longer require their mother to look after them or their parents have passed on, some women still choose not to rejoin the job market.“This is unlike Japan and South Korea, where women who stopped working due to similar reasons rejoin the workforce once their family-related responsibilities are reduced.“Despite the government’s incentive of tax exemptions for women returning to work after a career break, the take-up rate is low, ” he said.Creating a gender-diverse and inclusive workplace, Shamsuddin added, is a leadership matter.It must be a key component in employers’ policies and mission statements, as well as being demonstrated through actions.Gender biases must be managed through open dialogues and workplace campaigns as well, he said.“Women undoubtedly face more biases from both men and women themselves, explicitly and implicitly.“Unconscious bias is a result of ingrained cultural conditioning where women are not considered as valuable to the workforce, and they are seen as not very committed to the job or the organisation because of family responsibilities and conflicts.“Women might not be as forthcoming in expressing their discontent and their expectations from the employers as they are socially conditioned to undervalue themselves, ” he added.Moving forward, Shamsuddin said the female participation rate in the workforce could be pushed to higher rates, reaching beyond 60% of the LFP (labour force participation).Flexible working hours and work arrangements, work-life balance policies, and remote working are among the policies that could be implemented to encourage more women to work.“The private sector must embrace family-friendly policies and gender diversity in their workforce to boost women’s participation rate.“Employers who actively encourage, nurture and foster women in leadership roles also encourage more women into their workforce, ” he said.All Women's Action Society (Awam) information and communications officer Tan Chia Ee said the trend showing greater progress in closing the gender gap in educational attainment but less in economic participation is a global phenomenon.Occupational segregation could also explain the gender gap in economic participation, she added.“Women tend to concentrate in sectors such as retail, hospitality and care work while being underrepresented in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), both in universities and in the job market.“This is due to not only longstanding stereotypes surrounding women’s suitability in STEM careers but also having few role models and access to academic support that can boost their interest, motivation and confidence in entering STEM.“Labour market disruption due to Covid-19 exacerbates the gender gap in employment, as women are retrenched due to the destruction of sectors where they predominate, while female talent influx and/or rate of transitioning into STEM remains low, ” she said, adding that women still encounter substantial structural barriers to more productive employment.Women still face strong conventional societal expectations to be homemakers and caregivers, while men are still expected to be family breadwinners.This social norm, she said, can shape biases surrounding women’s suitability for work.In a survey conducted on Malaysian women, Tan said 47% of the 1,010 respondents were asked about their marital status during a job interview, 22% were asked about their ability to perform certain tasks as a woman, 15% were asked about their plans to have children, and 13% were asked if they would require a long maternity leave if they got pregnant.Such questions constitute gender-based discrimination and can directly affect employment outcomes, she stressed.To enable gender parity in employment, she said changes in pre-existing unequal gender power are necessary and the public must play its part.This could be achieved through a multi-pronged strategy involving education, awareness-raising and incentives.Solutions, too, must be viewed from a public policy angle and public awareness on gender equality needs to be increased.“The media also has a role to play in challenging social norms that perpetuate gender inequality.“By promoting sexist perceptions and interpretations, the media can reinforce existing patriarchal power relations, not only making it more difficult to challenge the gender inequality status quo, but also making physical and online spaces less safe for women.“By challenging patriarchal and actively shaping gender-equal public narratives in everyday media, substantial differences can be made in terms of creating a culture that supports gender equality, ” added Tan.Universiti Sains Malaysia Centre for Research on Women and Gender director Prof Dr Noraida Endut has 25 years of experience researching gender issues.The trend according to the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute study, she said, is not necessarily more alarming than before, but she described it as frustrating.“There is a lack of progress and even with progress, it is incremental and takes so much time.“In Malaysia, the LFP rate for women has always been low compared to men.“Only in the last five years or so has the overall LFP surpassed 50%, ” she explained.A study commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme in 2013, she said, showed that the four main reasons women don’t work or stop working include looking after their children, leaving after getting married, leaving upon their husband’s request, and supporting their husband's career growth.“Among the women who have worked before and are now unemployed, about 57% said they want to work but had to stop for various reasons and among the women who have never worked before, 43% said they would like to work.“Therefore, we can see that women end up not working because they had to give up their careers or had to give up seeking employment to fulfil their expected roles as mothers and wives... it's because they are women, ” she said.Prof Noraida stressed that there must be clear policies at workplaces to facilitate a balance between work and family.This would allow for improved gender division of labour at home and at work, allowing more women to return to their workplaces.“These policies include maternity protection that extends to both pre- and post-natal periods where women are given temporary reliefs from some work during their pregnancy, ” she said.In addition, there should also be measures that could include special parking for pregnant women, flexible work arrangements, and an ability to take time off to go for check-ups without sacrificing annual leave.Other moves could include providing safe and accessible lactation rooms, time off to use lactation rooms, and time off to look after sick children for both female and male employees.“A gender equality policy is also important to ensure the organisation observes and develops a gender-equal and non-discriminatory practice.“This includes, for example, prohibiting the practice of asking female candidates about her ability to execute her duties if she is a mother or about her potentially getting pregnant, ” added Prof Noraida.A sexual harassment policy and mechanism is also important because sexual harassment, she said, is a form of gender-based violence that hinders women’s access and opportunity to enjoy their rights at work.“It often causes women to be unfairly treated in their promotion or to be constructively dismissed.”Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities Centre for Research in Media and Communication Assoc Prof Dr Jamaluddin Aziz said the way forward is to depoliticise employment.He said the government, too, should step in to continue providing support systems that would facilitate women empowerment.Women empowerment projects, he said, must be carried out by the right groups and their efficiency must be tested and proven.“There are many factors that contribute to this trend.“Usually, these factors are when economic opportunities, level of literacy and cultural practices intersect with gender.“Therefore, gender is a valid lens from which this trend can be interpreted.“For instance, although a reasonable number of economic opportunities for women have been provided by the government, cultural practices, political interference, and level of literacy may hinder their participation, ” he explained.He said in some instances, although financial aid is given specifically to women to help with their businesses, some register for the benefit of their husbands.There are also those who register their businesses under their husbands’ names.“These are examples of issues at the operational level, while it is the fundamental levels that need more attention – such as the gender structure in our culture as it is often manifested in the way we assign value to men and women, and boys and girls.”Malaysia must move from this mentality and approach, he stressed.Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Countries around the world are exploring ways to show proof of an individual's Covid-19 immunity in order to allow travel and other easing of social restrictions.Several countries have initiated travel passports, which are Covid-19 vaccine certificates or any physical or digital document that would prove you've received both doses (or one dose for certain vaccines) of any of the available Covid-19 vaccines.In some countries, vaccine certificates can also be issued to those who have recently tested negative for Covid-19 or have built immunity against it after having been infected.All this would allow citizens to travel among participating countries or be granted exemptions to certain Covid-19 restrictions in their own country.A recent survey by market research firm Ipsos shows that more than three-quarters of adults surveyed (78%) across 28 countries agree that Covid-19 vaccine passports should be required of travellers entering their country.In comparison to the size of the majority in other countries polled, Malaysians were largely more supportive of having vaccine passports or similar health certificates in order to allow travellers to enter the country (92%).The survey was conducted from March 26 to April 9 with adults from the age of 16 to 75 in 28 countries.The findings show that Malaysians were also highly optimistic that vaccine passports will be widely used by the end of the year.\"They strongly believe that this will make travel and large events safe.\"Japan, host country of 2021 Olympics, and the United States, which has rolled out a vaccination programme efficiently, are not as optimistic as Malaysia,\" Ipsos said in a statement.Its managing director Arun Menon noted that countries across the world are progressing through their vaccination phases, but some are still facing larger surges or second or third waves of the pandemic.\"The Malaysian public widely supports the requirement of vaccine certificates to enter the country and access large venues.\"As we cross a year of living with Covid-19, the Malaysian public is looking for ways in which they can get back to normal, even if that requires carrying or mandating vaccine passports or similar health certificates,\" he said.Travel industry players are also hopeful that travel passports will help revive their battered industry.Travel passports or proof of vaccination can be in the form of a physical card, a piece of paper with a QR code, or most often, a mobile app.However, there is still no clear universal standard for vaccine certificates for all countries.The World Health Organisation has also outlined considerations regarding immunity passports due to the shortage of or unequal access to vaccines in many countries.Health experts in Malaysia advise caution on introducing travel passports too soon amid concerns of new Covid-19 variants emerging, vaccine effectiveness and the feasibility as well as fairness of establishing such a system.Despite that, many countries have already started initiating travel bubbles and vaccine passports among other selected countries.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised against travelling to certain parts of the world, and the US State Department's travel advisory outlines the level of Covid-19 risks in countries based on the spread of the Covid-19 virus and number of cases.Only 30 destinations in the world are classified under Level 1 in the travel advisory, which indicates a low risk of Covid-19. These include countries like Brunei, China, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand and Laos.CDC guidelines also noted that once fully vaccinated – defined as two weeks after taking the final dose – it is safe to meet indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks or keeping a distance.Some countries have also used vaccine certificates to return to some measure of normalcy with regard to social activities, such as allowing those with Covid-19 immunity to access mass gatherings, indoor venues and events -- such as stadiums, swimming pools, restaurants, gyms, theatres, concerts, hotels and also pilgrimage sites.However, the CDC guidelines advised those going to medium and large gatherings to take precautions by practising physical distancing and wearing a mask regardless of attendees' vaccination status.The Malaysian government suggested in early April that individuals who have completed two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine may be allowed to travel interstate or even abroad, as well as be exempted from certain Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SOPs).To date, no official decision has been made.The country is still in negotiations with international parties including Asean countries and the European Union on the need for a mutually recognised vaccine passport to resume travel among the partner states.\n",

      "From the Star Photo AlbumCapturing An Iconic Lightning StrikeBy Razak AhmadIN the blink of an eye, a giant spark of electricity shot down from the heavens and struck Putrajaya at 4.07pm on April 28, 2005.Nature offers a bounty of stunning images but few as fleeting, elusive and hard to capture in a photograph as lightning.Raja Faisal Hishan’s shot of that bolt of lightning as it hit the dome of the Prime Minister’s Office complex made the front page of The Star and won local and international accolades.The iconic image kicks off a series of interactive articles that aims to showcase some of the many stunning shots that The Star’s photographers have snapped over the years.Armed with 28 years of experience behind the lens, Raja Faisal recalls how he managed to catch lightning that stormy day 16 years ago.He was in the vicinity of the Prime Minister’s office for an interview assignment.Location of the Prime Minister's Office in PutrajayaPlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time00:12Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenThe sky, darkened by heavy clouds, was ablaze with lightning streaks signaling an impending thunderstorm.“I thought to myself, I need to capture this lightning.”It began to rain heavily, forcing him to seek shelter in his car as he tried to figure out how to get his shot.  He had to think fast.For safety, he decided to shoot from inside his car. He drove to a spot across the Prime Minister’s office complex and rolled down the window.He chose a wide angle 17-35mm lens as he didn’t know where exactly the lightning would strike.A lightning streak occurs in a fraction of a second, so he adjusted his Canon Mark 111 camera shutter speed to a high setting of 1/1250 sec and waited.And then it happened.There was a flash of light. He pressed the shutter button, capturing a machine gun rapid eight frames per second.Of the dozen frames he took; the lightning was present in four.He felt disappointed but decided to pack up and leave, rather than stay longer and raise the risk of getting struck.Checking his images after he got home, he realised he had done it.One of the four shots showed a perfect lightning strike on the dome of the Perdana Putra building.Photographer Raja Faisal explaining step by step how he captured the lightning videoPlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time04:34Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenThe photo made the front page of The Star on April 30 that year.The image won him first prize at the 2006 Malaysian Press Institute Award in the Media Photo News, beating over 61 other entries.It also won earned him the Silver Award in the Spot News category of the Asia Media Awards 2006 organised by Ifra, the world’s leading association for newspaper and media publishing.The awards were open to media organisations throughout Asia, with Raja Faisal the first winner from Malaysia.Raja Faisal winning the Silver Award during the Asia Media Awards 2006While photographing a fleeting flash of lightning is challenging, lightning itself is no stranger to many parts of Malaysia.The Klang Valley reportedly has the third highest number of lightning strikes in the world.Last year, the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang had a whopping 341 days with lightning.It was the highest for 2020 based on records of the Malaysian Meteorological Department’s 42 main meteorological stations.Subang meanwhile holds the record for the area with the highest ever number of days with lightning ever recorded.According to MetMalaysia’s figures, there were 362 days with lightning in Subang in 1987.Put another way, there were only three days in 1987 when the highly urbanised city in Selangor’s Petaling district did not see lightning.PlayPlaySeek% bufferedCurrent time01:16Toggle MuteVolumeToggle FullscreenAccording to MetMalaysia, the highest amount of lightning is seen during the country’s inter-monsoon periods between April to May and October.Lightning is also frequent between June and September during the south-west monsoon.The north-east monsoon from December to March however sees relatively fewer incidences of lightning.Story: Razak AhmadPhotograph: Raja Faisal HishanAnimation: Nor Shalina Abdul Samad and Shaiful Rizwan Mohd AzharVisualisation: Sim Leoi LeoiTOPBuilt with Shorthand\n",

      "Myanmar at a Crossroadsby MAZWIN NIK ANIS and JOSEPH KAOS, JRAP PhotoWHEN the 10 members of Asean meet for a special summit in Jakarta today, the most urgent and immediate task at hand is to resolve the political crisis in Myanmar, which has so far seen over 700 people killed in protests across the country.The fact that the summit, the first physical meeting amidst a pandemic, is taking place speaks volume of the urgent matter at hand and will see the attendance of heads of government, except for Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan o-cha who has confirmed that he will be skipping the meet.Thailand will instead be represented by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai.If the head of Myanmar’s military government, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, does indeed show up for the meet, this will be his first known foreign trip since the junta's coup on Feb 1.Protesters pour water in an attempt to diminish the effects of tear gas during a crackdown by security forces on a demonstration against the military coup in Yangon's Thaketa township on March 19, 2021. (Photo by STR / AFP)The Asean leaders' meeting in Jakarta, which was called by Indonesia, will be chaired by Brunei’s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah as the 2021 Asean chair.Also present will be Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.Muhyiddin, said Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein, had received a special invitation letter from Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah to attend the meet on April 17.“The Prime Minister has formally responded to the letter on April 19 that he will be attending the meeting,\" he told reporters during a buka puasa event at Wisma Putra on April 20.On Feb 5, Muhyiddin and Indonesian president Joko “Jokowi” Widodo had said that they were seeking a special meeting of the South-East Asian nations to discuss the situation in Myanmar.Singapore is also in support of the proposal.During the summit, coincidentally, Min is expected to sit next to Muhyiddin.As the country harbouring a large number of refugees from Myanmar - Rohingya from the conflict-ridden Rakhine State, as well as those of the Chin ethnic group, among others - Malaysia is certainly keen to see the current political crisis resolved as peacefully and as quickly as possible.This is particularly so when there is now a real fear of Myanmar turning into another \"Syria\", a country wracked by civil war since 2011.  \"There are clear echoes of Syria in 2011,\" United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has warned on April 14.On Sept 26 last year, as Malaysia grapples with the economic spillover from the Covid-19 pandemic, Muhyiddin has told the United Nations that as a developing nation coping with the cost of managing and providing protection to nearly 180,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers in the country - 86% of them from Myanmar - its resources are being stretched thin.Read more: Find moral courage, political will to do what's right, Muhyiddin tells UNPrime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. - BernamaMalaysia and Asean members will surely not want the present conflict in Myanmar to worsen and result in an even worse flood of refugees.Thailand, Myanmar's neighbour on the south, is already having to face some 2,000 refugees from the ethnic Karen minority massing along its border following air strikes by the junta.Myanmar, the largest country on mainland south-east asia with a population of 54 million people comprising 135 recognised ethnic groups, has long been engrossed in ethnic strife and is engaged in ongoing civil wars with various armed factions within the country, such as the Shan state army near the Thai border.Read more: Worried about Myanmar’s futureA Myanmar national in Malaysia, Than Phe Lay, says they will make their feelings heard via online protests.It was only recently - before the Feb 1 coup - that the country has seen relative peace under some semblance of democratic rule and trade with its neighbours flourish.But the killing of protesters in street demonstrations by the military junta has led to some ethnic armed factions vowing not to stand by and do nothing should this continue.Malaysia, said Hishammuddin, remains firm in its stance that the violence in Myanmar must end and that political detainees must be released immediately.  “We will reiterate Malaysia’s stance on the Myanmar situation in which the violence in the country must cease immediately.“Secondly, all political leaders in Myanmar must be released immediately.Read more: Malaysia calls for Suu Kyi’s releaseForeign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein. - MOHD SAHAR“Thirdly, Myanmar must agree to receive representatives from the Asean chair, which is Brunei, or from the Asean secretariat to help the country return to normalcy,” he stressed.From the three-finger salute, an inspiration from the dystopian novel Hunger Games, to painted Easter eggs, graffiti, and popular memes, the people in Myanmar are taking their fight for democracy to the Internet.The Internet has become as important - and certainly less risky- a frontline as the streets for protesters in the country.Brought on up a diet of social media feed, this Internet-savvy generation of protesters are making sure that when they do turn up for their rallies, they are colourful, unusual and Instagram-worthy to catch the world's spotlight and make sure that their fight is not forgotten.And despite the shutdown of Internet access by the military, they are making sure to flood social media with memes, ranging from Pepe the Frog to NFSW mottoess, mostly in English.This photo taken and received courtesy of an anonymous source on April 8, 2021, shows shoes being displayed with flowers in Mandalay, as part of the \"Marching Shoes Strike\" called on social media.

(AP Photo)Malaysia, the Foreign Minister has reiterated, will not be wavering from its stand.Besides the concern of more refugees as well as the occasional rallies against the treatment of Rohingya by the junta, Malaysia has generally enjoyed good relations with Myanmar in trade and tourism, with robust air links between Kuala Lumpur and cities like Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyidaw before Covid-19 put paid to flights.Demonstrators with tape on their mouths holding posters during a peaceful rally \"Silent Protest: In Solidarity With The People Of Rohingya\" by Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia at Dataran Merdeka in December 2018. RAYMOND OOI/ The StarIn fact, while many Western countries sought to levy sanctions and condemn Myanmar during Aung Sang Suu Kyi's house arrest in the 1990s and early 2000s, Malaysia has worked, through diplomatic overtures via Asean, for her eventual release, which subsequently, ushered in democratic rule in Myanmar.Aung Sang Suu Kyi is now back under house arrest and facing various charges, including corruption, while other senior leaders of the National League of Democracy (NLD), which won overwhelmingly in a general election declared void by the junta, are in detention and have their offices ransacked.The democratic progress of the recent past years is now in danger of coming undone.

      "PETALING JAYA: Ahead of Hari Raya Aidilfitri next month, many Malaysians are wondering whether they would be allowed to travel across state lines to celebrate the festival in their hometowns amid the Covid-19 pandemic.On Thursday (April 15), Health Minister Datuk Dr Adham Baba said that his ministry had proposed a postponement in allowing interstate travel for Aidilfitri celebrations as the Covid-19 transmission rate is still at a worrying level.The ministry had earlier said that it would do a risk assessment study to determine if it is safe to allow interstate travel for Aidilfitri, or whether doing so would lead to another surge of Covid-19 infections.For context, on March 5 the government allowed travel across districts while interstate movement remained restricted.The Star analysed the Health Ministry’s Covid-19 figures from March 1 to April 14 to get a clearer picture on whether things have been improving.What does the data show?One of the things health authorities and experts measure when trying to find out where things are headed is the infection’s reproduction number, called R0 (pronounced as “R naught”).The R value refers to the number of people that a person who has the coronavirus will infect.If the R value is 1 for example, it means that on average, one infected person will spread Covid-19 to one other individual.An R value higher than 1 means that the number of cases will increase.However, if the R value goes down, the disease will eventually stop spreading as not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak.To calculate the reproduction number, experts use data such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time to estimate how easily the virus is spreading.Since March 1, the daily R value for Malaysia as released by the Health Ministry has climbed to more than 1:Community clusters on the riseOf late there has been an apparent increase in the number of infections due in part to a failure to follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) during social activities and gatherings.In Terengganu, for example, mengeteh or ngeteh – having coffee or tea with friends in restaurants or stalls after subuh (dawn) prayers in mosques or surau – was one factor behind the emergence of a Covid-19 cluster in Besut.Last month, Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah reminded Sarawakians to avoid social gatherings and comply with the Covid-19 SOP.He said the number of cases was high of late because of the failure of some people to adhere to the SOP, particularly at social gatherings.\"Several clusters have emerged from social gatherings, where those affected were involved in funerals, weddings, gambling or cock-fighting activities.\"These social activities sometimes involve inter-district travel and movement from red zones to other zones, causing the disease to spread,\" he said at the state disaster management committee's briefing in Kuching on March 1.Often, such cases will involve what the Health Ministry classifies as community clusters.According to the ministry’s background description of the clusters, some were linked to funerals, celebrations, social gatherings and weddings.The remaining community clusters were related to index cases detected during hospital admission and procedure screening, pre-employment screening, pre-interstate travel screening as well as screenings of symptomatic individuals.The ministry's figures show that of the 347 new Covid-19 clusters that emerged from March 1 to April 14, 83 (23.9%) were classified as community clusters, making them the second biggest type of cluster behind workplace clusters, which recorded a figure of 236 (68%).A likely reason why workplace clusters dominate is the government’s decision to make it mandatory for all foreign workers to undergo screening.However, authorities experts have repeatedly warned about the threat that is also posed by infections within the community.In deciding whether it will be okay for Malaysians to travel to their hometowns for Hari Raya Aidilfitri, the Health Ministry has said that its risk assessment would be based on six factors:What the experts sayUniversiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman said interstate travel for the purpose of balik kampung should not be allowed until most of the vulnerable groups of the population have received their vaccinations.\"We have observed, based on recent data from the Health Ministry, that 69% of deaths related to Covid-19 involve those who are 60 years old and above, and 89% of them have underlying health conditions.\"If active and new cases are within one to two digits, and most of our vulnerable group (the elderly and those with comorbidities) have received their vaccines, only then should interstate travel for the country be allowed,\" she said.She urged the public to continue to take precautions, adding that decisions should be made to avoid the possibility of a fourth wave of infections.\"The government should continue current strategies on managing the outbreak, enforcement of regulations under Act 342, and promoting the vaccines.\"At the same time, all of us in the community should follow all those procedures, comply with the SOP and sign up for the vaccine,\" said Dr Malina.Universiti Putra Malaysia's consultant clinical microbiologist Prof Dr Zamberi Sekawi said that until the number of cases is reduced significantly and herd immunity is achieved, where at least 80% of the population is vaccinated, it is not yet safe for the public to travel freely or live a \"normal life\".\"With the current figures, chances are we won't be able to travel interstate for Hari Raya.\"Once you open up the borders, the number of cases will surely go up and spread to states where there are few cases,\" he said.Dr Zamberi said if the number of cases is not kept to a low figure, the country risks facing deadlier mutations of the coronavirus.\"Our best option now is to get as many people vaccinated,\" he said.He said the government can encourage more people to get vaccinated by giving special allowance to social activities for those who have received the vaccine, such as being able to gather without wearing masks.Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs senior fellow Dr Carmelo Ferlito, meanwhile, believes that movement controls such as the travel ban should be implemented in a targeted approach instead of having generalised policies.He said policies and solutions should be drafted to keep those at risk safe and protected, such as by restricting those liable to severe Covid-19 infections from traveling and to remain confined, while ensuring they have access to ad hoc support.\"We should allow the healthy part of the population to conduct a normal life, eventually get infected and go through the illness, developing immunity,\" he said, adding that for this segment of the population, limitations on the number of people per gathering, scientifically decided on a square metre basis of available space, is sufficient.He added that with such an approach, a lot of money could be saved in economic stimuli and instead be invested in developing an effective long-term treatment, which is beyond the use of Covid-19 vaccines.\"We have lost more than one year and resources in not trying to develop a treatment,\" he said.He highlighted that the percentage of total mortality from the total number of Covid-19 cases in the country has been on a constant downward trend since September and is currently at 0.37%, a relatively low figure when compared to other countries.He added that the mortality rate was also low in comparison to other illnesses or fatalities due to road accidents.\"At the same time, some scientific articles, like a recent one from Science, pointed out that our main concern cannot be simply to limit transmissions.\"In fact, by limiting transmissions we can prolong the duration of the pandemic to 10 years, never allowing it to become endemic,\" he said, arguing that interstate travel ban would already be safe if a targeted strategy was implemented.He said that data on death distribution by age groups and with comorbidities can help the government determine who are most at risk, and thus implement policies to protect them.\"It is also good to have access to the distribution of Covid-19 tests such as the ratio between tests and cases in places like workplaces and others,\" he said.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Unhealthy lifestyles are killing more and more Malaysians, with deaths linked to ailments such as heart and cererbrovascular diseases nearly doubling from 2000 to 2017.This is among the findings of an analysis done by The Star based on Statistics Department figures on the causes of deaths in the country since the year 2000.Commenting on the findings, health experts said the trend underscores why it is vital for Malaysians to adopt a healthy lifestyle through balanced diets, regular exercises and other good habits as these will help prevent health conditions that are killing a growing number of us each year.According to the department’s figures, heart diseases, pneumonia and cerebrovascular diseases are, in order, the top three causes of deaths in the country.Deaths due to ischaemic heart disease saw a nearly two-fold (197%) increase in Malaysia in 2017 compared to 2000.In comparison, the population of Malaysia over the same period only grew by 36%, from 23.49 million in 2000 to 32.02 million in 2017.Ishchaemic heart disease, which is also a leading cause of death in many other countries, happens when arteries cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart, causing a heart attack.In Malaysia, it mainly affects people aged between 41 and 59 years old, as well as those 60 years old and above, especially in urban areas.About 15% of the 109,164 medically certified deaths in 2019 was caused by ischaemic heart disease, followed by pneumonia (12.2%) and cerebrovascular disease (8%).Ischaemic heart disease was the primary cause of death among males, with men making up 69.4% of those who died from the disease, while pneumonia was the top cause of death for females.The number of deaths from cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs), a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, increased by 112% in 2017 compared to 2000.According to the World Health Organisation, an estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths.\"Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke.\"Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies,\" it said.Medical Practitioners Coalition Association of Malaysia president Dr Raj Kumar Maharajah said the steady increase in deaths caused by non-communicable diseases is due to unhealthy lifestyles.“Everyone feels that the responsibility for their health rests with their family doctor or the Health Ministry. People must realise that they are responsible for their own health and wellbeing.“Obesity rates, for instance, have skyrocketed and we are now the most obese nation in South-East Asia, ” he said.He also added that people in recent years are choosing to “self-medicate” from information they find on the Internet, especially over the last decade.“Many a time, patients search their symptoms on the Internet and they get their medication directly from the pharmacy or traditional medicine men -- bypassing their general practitioners.“This can cause irreversible damage to their bodies and by the time they go to the doctors and get their problems detected, the damage has already been done, ” he said.Dr Raj Kumar suggested that for patients to lead healthier lifestyles to prevent cerebrovascular diseases or ischaemic heart diseases, they must have a dedicated family doctor to continuously monitor their health.“With the Internet, there is too much information from unreliable sources. Patients must not self-medicate or take supplements without checking with their doctors.“Children in schools should be taught to eat good food, exercise regularly and sleep well. This has to be ingrained in school as it will become a habit to lead healthy lifestyles, ” he said.Malaysian Medical Association president Datuk Dr Subramaniam Muniandy said diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity caused by poor lifestyle habits can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases as well as pneumonia.Commenting on men being more susceptible to heart diseases compared to women, Dr Subramanian said the higher risk among men can be due to poor lifestyle choices.\"Unhealthy eating, smoking and alcoholism is known to be higher among men and this can be contributing factors,\" he said.Dr Subramaniam encouraged lifestyle adjustments to reduce the risk of developing these medical conditions.\"It is also important that people go for scheduled medical checkups with their general practitioners to be up to date on their health status,\" he said.Meanwhile, deaths caused by pneumonia recorded the largest increase of 579% or 10,543 more deaths in 2017 compared to 2000 and is the leading cause of death for women.\"Pneumonia is a condition where the lungs are infected because its smallest units, the sacs of alveoli, are filled with inflammatory fluid or purulent discharge (pus), which would lead to difficulty in breathing, compromised gas exchange, and reduce oxygen intake by the individual,\" said Universiti Putra Malaysia medical epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Malina Osman.Dr Malina said that the disease is mainly caused by micro-organisms like viruses, bacteria, fungi, and it is associated with underlying individual health status such as immune status, any chronic illness or pre-existing lung disorder, and socio-environmental factors such as pollutants, ventilation, crowding, and others.She believes that the large hike in the number of deaths related to pneumonia over the years may be due to improved documentation and classification, as well as medical diagnosis.\"There may be some changes in case definition for cause of death for the purpose of reporting.\"In early 2000, some of those cases with infection were being classified as septicemia,\" she said.Septicemia is a bloodstream infection that occurs when a bacterial infection, which happens elsewhere in the body, enters the bloodstream.The number of deaths caused by septicemia had indeed decreased in 2015 and did not garner notable increase thereafter.\"In general, pneumonia is treatable and preventable. There are some vaccines against certain infections,\" said Dr Malina, adding that those with immunity problems such as the young or elderly with health complications, may face more severe complications if infected with the disease.The World Health Organisation estimates that pneumonia kills an estimated 1.4 million children under the age of five every year.The disease is also the third leading cause of death for children under five.Dr Malina said the government, through the Health Ministry, allocated a specific budget for children's vaccination programmes and revised the type of vaccines and the vaccination schedule for children in 2020.\"At the current stage, those vaccines are available in all health clinics in our country,\" she said.Starting Dec 1,2020, the country kicked off the national pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) programme that allows children born from Jan 1,2020, onwards to be entitled to free pneumococcal vaccine jabs at the Health Ministry’s health clinics.The vaccine is aimed at preventing bacterial infections of streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus, which can cause diseases such as pneumonia, sinusitis, middle ear infection (otitis media), meningitis and septicemia.\"Every parent should get their children vaccinated to prevent severe cases of pneumonia that can cause death,\" she said.\n",

      "THE Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to seriously look at the way we live our lives and more importantly at how we consume food.As many people lost their jobs due to the pandemic, there are those who resorted to growing their own organic vegetables at home naturally, with some hard work.This is to offset paying a huge price for imported organic vegetables.“When we look at the organic agriculture industry in Malaysia, we find that we import a huge percentage of organic food, which doesn’t make sense because we are a farming country at the heart of it, ” said Petaling Jaya-based The Urban Farm director Brendan Lee.He said there was not much education in Malaysia when it came to organic and non-organic vegetables.“All this importing causes such a huge price discrepancy too. Organic vegetables can cost double or triple the price of non-organic vegetables, ” he explained.Brendan opined that we often do not think about the source of the vegetables, where it comes from and how it is grown.“Imported organic vegetables are expensive so people don’t see the need for it. And even if they do, many cannot afford to buy it.“It’s a shame, because when you look at other more developed countries, the difference between non-organic and organic vegetables is at 30%, which is very affordable.“That’s like US$3 (RM12.44) for non-organic and US$3.90 (RM16.17) for a head of organic lettuce in the US, while in Malaysia, it is RM3 for non-organic and RM7.50 for organic.”Brendan’s aquaponic farm was set up more than two years ago, and even then they were not the first.Aquaponic is a pesticide-free way of farming that combines aquaculture --- in this case growing fish --- and hydroponics which is growing plants without soil.The fish do most of the work, by eating and producing waste.The beneficial bacteria in the water converts the waste into nutrient-rich water and is fed to the soil-less plants.Brendan said there were more small and medium-size players coming into the farm-in-the-city game.“This is great, and it is not uncommon to source vegetables from other farms, so you will find that in this industry there is a lot of cross-buying and selling, ” added Brendan.Recently, Brendan started his second farm in Petaling Jaya Old Town, where he had built a fully indoor vertical farm.\"We are still utilising aquaponics as the method to grow our vegetables, but we have additional control over the environment with regards to temperature and daylight (through the use of LED grow lights), ” he said.This controlled environment allows him to grow many varieties of vegetables which are unable to tolerate the high temperature outdoors.Brendan, 27, grows many different varieties of kale (Curly kale and Siberian kale), lettuce (Lollo Bionda, butterhead, romaine), herbs (rocket, mint, sweet basil) and local favourites such as dwarf bok choy.According to him, vegetable prices customarily fluctuate depending on the weather.\"Excessive rain and flooding will cause prices of the produce to go up. Growing them indoors solves this issue,\" he said.He added that vertical farming also reduced the need to clear land for agricultural use.“By employing new technologies and systems, unused or abandoned urban areas can be revitalised and utilised for food production, ” he said.Over in Cheras, e-business student Sean Lee, 19, needed a hobby last year when the movement control order was first implemented.He had a lot of time on his hands when he was not attending his online university classes.More importantly, he was determined to find a solution to heal his father’s psoriasis.“My father can only eat organic vegetables.“The main problem is the fertiliser and pesticides used in (conventional) farming, and his immune system is working against him.“So, I decided to grow my own vegetables for him, ” said the teenager with a keen interest in aquaponic farming and who is the bubbly proprietor of E-Farm.Sean always had a love for rearing fish in aquariums, but did not like maintaining and cleaning the filtration system, which is why aquaponics worked for him.He started his aquaponic project with one fish tank, a makeshift filter and two vertical plant towers that had spinach, curly kale and bok choy.“Kale is rich in antioxidants, so I gave this to my father and his psoriasis healed a little, ” he said.He set out to start aquaponic farming on a corner lot house with a big garden that could fit a 92.9sq m greenhouse to grow 25 types of vegetables and herbs.It took two months and the help of many property agents to locate the ideal site to start his aquaponic farm, after scouting in Petaling Jaya, Subang Jaya and parts of Kuala Lumpur.As you step into the split-level greenhouse, the first thing you will notice is the pond full of healthy red tilapia.An automated feeder is stocked with fish pellets, and the fish are fed every three hours between 10am and 7pm.Sean said their fish pellets were custom-made to not contain any antibiotics or growth hormones.\"The fish are also fed vegetable scraps from unsold vegetables at the farm.\"Red tilapia are a common breed of fish used in aquaponic farming.“Patin and koi fish can also be used for aquaponic farming, ” he said.The oyster shells in the fish tank contain calcium and act as a buffer to maintain the optimum Ph level of 6.2 to 7 in the water.The aquaponic process starts with vegetable pellets that are fed to the fish and their waste produces ammonia. The waste is then pumped into the filtration system to remove the solids.The ammonia-filled water is pumped into the biotank, which is an “apartment for bacteria”, with a big surface area.“The bacteria will consume the ammonia (NH₃), and will change it into nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-). Nitrates are what plants need.“The ammonia and nitrite need to be at ‘0’ optimally, as both are poisonous to the fish.“The function of the biotank is to negate the ammonia and nitrite, ” Sean explained.The nitrate-rich water is pumped into the power system, where the plants absorb all the nutrients from the grow beds and multiple aisles of vertical trickle towers.The water from the tower will slowly make its way down into the pond system and from there it feeds the fish again.Sean grows vegetables such as bok choy (which have standard white or emerald green stems and come in a variety of species like Milky, King, Green Dynasty and Four Seasons); choy sum (Shangrila, King and Japan varieties), kale, watercrest, Oba or shiso leaf (Japanese mint), lettuce (green coral and butterhead), Okinawa spinach, Brazilian spinach and herbs such stevia, peppermint, spearmint, rosemary, mizuna and ensabi.He has 120 vertical towers with each holding 90 plants, totalling 10,800 plants overall.The eight grow beds underneath the towers are a space saver, he said.“Every inch is crucial for optimisation, ” he added.The grow bed uses clay balls, called hydroton or light expanded clay aggregate (LECA) which is a substitute for soil.Sean said the system only runs on one water pump which means their electricity bill was kept at a reasonable amount, averaging about RM500 a month while their water bill was RM15 monthly.“Suffice to say, this is a low cost way of growing vegetables, ” he said.Animation by Nor Shalina Abdul Samad and Shaiful Rizwan.Interactive graphics by Diyana Pfordten.\n",

      "JAKARTA (Reuters) - It took $100,000 plus expenses, and the opportunity for a reduced prison sentence, for the smartphone developer to collaborate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2018 and kick-start Operation Trojan Shield, according to a court document.Three years later, the investigation involving 9,000 law enforcement officers from 17 countries saw authorities monitor 27 million messages from 12,000 devices in 100 countries and track the activities of more than 300 organised crime groups, the European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol, said in a statement.To date, there have been more than 800 arrests and the seizure of more than eight tonnes of cocaine, 22 tonnes of cannabis, two tonnes of synthetic drugs, 250 guns, 55 luxury vehicles and over $48 million in cash and cryptocurrencies, Europol said.More arrests and seizures are expected, it said.The U.S. court document - an affidavit from an FBI special agent first published by Vice News - says the \"confidential human source\", a former drug trafficker, had been creating a new hardened encrypted phone with a bespoke app called ANOM.The source came on board after authorities dismantled the Phantom Secure encrypted smartphone network and arrested its CEO in 2018.For at least a decade, organised crime groups have used phones like Phantom Secure to organise drug deals, hits on rivals and launder illicit earnings without detection, police say. Among many of the phones' features, content can be remotely wiped if they are seized.But as one model was put out of business, new ones would enter the lucrative market.The FBI decided it would launch its own, inserting a master key into the devices that attached to each message and enabled law enforcement officers to decrypt and store them as they were transmitted.'COUPLE OF BEERS'In 2018, Australian police investigators and analysts met with the FBI. \"As you know, some of the best ideas come over a couple of beers,\" said Australian Federal Police (AFP) commissioner Reece Kershaw on Tuesday.Prodded by authorities, the developer-turned-informant tapped his trusted distributors, who targeted the Australian market. They settled on a soft launch in October 2018. The developer gave the distributors only 50 devices to sell. Seeing a \"huge payday\", they agreed, according to the affidavit.As the AFP monitored the messages and photos shared on the devices, \"100% of ANOM users in the test phase used ANOM to engage in criminal activity\", the affidavit said. Business grew organically, by word-of-mouth. Soon overseas criminals were flocking to use the ANOM phone.Law enforcers had \"an edge\" that they had never had before, said Kershaw. Among hundreds of arrests and tons of drugs seized, Australian authorities said they also disrupted 21 murder plots, including a mass killing, thanks to ANOM.But, due to \"technological issues\", the FBI could not directly monitor the phones in Australia. A court order in late 2019, however, issued by an unspecified country where a server for the phones was located, gave the agency far greater and more timely access to their content.The FBI and other countries' law enforcers discovered that Italian organised crime, Asian triads, biker gangs and transnational drug syndicates were all users.The special agent's affidavit, and the AFP's Kershaw, said criminals used the phones openly, often not even using code words and frequently sharing photos of massive drug consignments and details of how they would be transported.Among the images shared in the affidavit were mounds of blocks of illicit drugs and a diplomatic pouch identified in the court document as French and allegedly used to transport cocaine from Colombia. There was also evidence of corrupt government officials and police.Crime groups were being \"notified of anticipated enforcement actions\", the affidavit said.\"The review of ANOM messages has initiated numerous high-level public corruption cases in several countries.\"Raids targeting users of another encrypted phone, Sky ECC, in March saw ANOM's popularity surge, with active users growing from 3,000 to 9,000 in months, the affidavit said.But the expiry of the unspecified country's court order on Monday signalled the end of the phones' torrent of criminal intelligence. In a series of news conferences around the world the next day, Operation Trojan Shield was revealed.

      "PARISA HAFEZI，JOHN IRISH\n",
      "DUBAI (Reuters) - A host of barriers to the revival of Iran's nuclear deal remain firmly in place ahead of talks due to resume this week between Tehran and world powers, suggesting a return to compliance with the 2015 accord is still a way off, four diplomats, two Iranian officials and two analysts say.Iranian demands about sanctions relief and Western concern over Iran's expanding nuclear know-how are among questions that may need weeks or possibly months of further negotiations, the diplomats and analysts said.The talks seek to revive a landmark pact under which Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions, which opened the way for a brief thaw in decades of U.S.-Iranian confrontation.Then-President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 saying it was too soft on Tehran, and reimposed sanctions. Iran responded by violating the agreement's limits.Trump's successor Joe Biden has said he wants to restore the deal's nuclear limits and if possible extend them to cover issues such as Iran's regional behaviour and missile programme. Iran wants all sanctions lifted and no expansion of the terms.European Union envoy Enrique Mora, the chief coordinator of the talks, said last week he believed a deal would be reached at the upcoming sixth round of negotiations in Vienna, expected to resume on Thursday or Friday.Adding to the impetus to make progress is an election in Iran on June 18 to replace President Hassan Rouhani, a pragmatist who promoted the original deal. He is widely expected to be followed by a hardline successor.The election is not likely to change Tehran's negotiating stance: regardless of who is president any deal must be approved by Iran's hardline faction through Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. But neither Washington nor Tehran wants to start from scratch, or entangle the deal further in Iranian domestic politics.Iran's top nuclear negotiator said last week that barriers to a revival of the deal are complicated but not insurmountable. \"Differences have reached a point where everyone believes these differences are not insolvable,\" Abbas Araqchi said.However, none of the remaining sticking points lend themselves to rapid solutions, according to the diplomats, Iranian officials and analysts of Iranian nuclear matters.Their assessment chimes with downbeat remarks on Monday by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said Washington still did not know whether Iran was ready to resume compliance with the deal.\"I doubt that the next round will be the final one... The parties are still far apart on core issues,\" said Ali Vaez, senior Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group.And when, or if, disagreements are solved, more talks would be needed on so-called sequencing - the delicate question of which side takes which action and when, in return for reciprocal steps by the other side, the diplomats said.The negotiations have made considerable progress but are now at the hardest part with the key decisions still needed, said a European diplomat briefed on the talks, which began in April.'THE HEART OF THE MATTER'The talks have arrived at \"the heart of the matter on the nuclear dimension\", a second European diplomat said.A senior Western diplomat said that “of course” he hoped that the next round would result in a deal, but injected a note of caution, saying “until we are able to resolve the important issues that remain, we won’t know.”An Iranian official said: \"Everything depends on Washington. If the American side accepts to lift all sanctions, then Iran will return into full compliance with the deal.\"In addition to seeking the lifting of Trump-era sanctions, Tehran also wants Washington to remove Iran's Revolutionary Guards from a terrorism blacklist, which can be used to bar Iranian businesses from the international financial system. It wants Europe to guarantee foreign investors will return, and assurances that Washington will not renege on the deal again.But from the standpoint of Washington and its European allies, it would no longer be sufficient to return to the nuclear restrictions in the orginal deal, designed at the time to ensure that Iran could not build a bomb in less than a year.In the months that Iran has been breaching the limits, it has made technical advances that make the original restrictions out of date. Vaez noted that Iran has begun using advanced centrifuges, known as the IR9, which are 50 times more powerful at producing enriched uranium than the ones covered by the deal, known by its initials as the JCPoA.BREAKOUT TIME\"If Iran refuses to destroy these machines, its breakout time will be shorter, unless it agrees to dismantle an equivalent number of IR1 machines. That is seen by Iran as humiliating and beyond the JCPoA's scope,\" Vaez said.The Iranians have acquired knowledge and capabilities they did not have before, said the European diplomat briefed on the talks, citing Iran's first ever production of uranium metal, a material that can be used to make the core of an atom bomb.The development, reported this year by the International Atomic Energy Agency, was not something covered by the 2015 deal, and any revival of the pact would have to take account of this new-found capability, Vaez said.Bob Einhorn, a former senior State Department official and nuclear negotiator with Iran, thought it highly unlikely that there would be an agreement before the presidential election, but conceivable one could be struck during the interim \"lame duck\" period before the new president takes office.Einhorn, now at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said there could be some political advantage for the new Iranian president to a deal being agreed during the interim.A new president could criticize any concessions made by the current Iranian administration of President Hassan Rouhani, then later take credit for any economic boost the deal produced, he said. \"So you could see a kind of logic.\"(Reporting by Parisa Hafezi in Dubai; Additional reporting by John Irish in Paris, Arshad Mohammed in Washington and Francois Murphy in Vienna; Writing by William Maclean; Editing by Peter Graff)\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Parti Pejuang Tanah Air, which has yet to be officially registered, has received an invitation to have an audience with Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah at Istana Negara.Its pro-tem information chief Ulya Aqamah Husamudin said the party’s pro-tem chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad is scheduled to have an audience with the King on Thursday (June 10).“We received the official letter to have an audience with the King last week. However, we have yet to find out the exact time of the meeting, ” he told Bernama on Tuesday (June 8).Talk had been rife about political leaders being called to have an audience with the King.It is believed that the meeting will discuss issues in the current political landscape.However, when asked if they had received a similar invitation, Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia information chief Datuk Wan Saiful Wan Jan and MCA secretary-general Datuk Chong Sin Woon both said they had yet to be informed about the matter.Meanwhile, Gerakan president Datuk Dr Dominic Lau Hoe Chai and MIC president Tan Sri S.A. Vigneswaran said their parties have not received an official invitation to the Palace.Umno deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan admitted hearing talk about the King’s invitation but could not say if the party had received one.“I just heard the talk (about an audience with the King). I haven’t been to the office... I’m not sure if (Umno) has received an invitation or not, ” he said.PKR secretary-general Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution told Bernama to refer to a member of the Opposition’s ad hoc committee to end the Emergency, Datuk Seri Khairuddin Abu Hassan.On Monday (June 7), Khairuddin tweeted that the King had consented to meeting with political party leaders, including those from the opposition.In January, the King consented to the proclamation of a nationwide Emergency as a proactive step to manage the Covid-19 pandemic.The Emergency would last until Aug 1 or an earlier date if the pandemic can be brought under control.In February, the King consented to an appointment of an independent task force under Section 2 of the Emergency Ordinance (Essential Powers) 2021 to advise His Majesty on matters concerning the Emergency, including whether to continue or end it.\n",

      "MONTPELLIER, France (Reuters) - Laboratory technician Sara Zemmahi was running to be a local councillor backed by President Emmanuel Macron's ruling party until last month when it withdrew its support. Her transgression: wearing her hijab in a campaign poster.The 26-year-old and the three other candidates who had been on the same ticket are now running as independents in the southern city of Montpellier under the slogan \"Different but united for you\".The affair erupted after the far-right seized upon the image as proof Macron was weak on protecting France's secular values, and propelled Zemmahi into a national row over identity.\"We're not giving up,\" Zemmahi said, still wearing her hijab as she distributed campaign fliers in La Mosson, a low-income Montpellier district that is home to generations of Muslim immigrants from France's former north African colonies.In her first interview since she became embroiled in the national debate over the role of Islam in France, Zemmahi said she wanted to focus on promoting equal opportunities and fighting discrimination.\"This is my neighbourhood, I was born here. The headscarf wasn't an issue for the four of us.\"However, across much of France it is.Zemmahi's campaign photo split Macron's LaRem party, reflecting deep divisions over how secular laws should be applied, notably after Islam emerged as the country's second-biggest religion behind Catholicism.For supporters of a strict interpretation of laïcité, France's version of secularism, Islamic headwear has become a symbol of the politicisation of Islam, subjugation and resistance to the Republic's vision of French identity.Laïcité and identity will be central to the campaign battle ahead of the 2022 presidential vote. Opinion polls show far-right leader Marine Le Pen will be Macron's biggest challenger.Mahfoud Benali, who heads Zemmahi's ticket, said France was changing.\"I'm in favour of elected officials who reflect society,\" he said.FAR-RIGHT CHALLENGEZemmahi is not dogmatic about her headscarf. she often removes it at her laboratory for hygiene reasons. Zemmahi's fellow candidates said the campaign photo was meant to illustrate how they reflected the local demographic.The affair erupted after the number 2 in Le Pen's Rassemblement National party questioned Macron's credentials as a defender of secular values from what the president terms \"Islamist separatism\".\"Is this how you fight separatism?\" Jordan Bardella tweeted along with a copy of the flier.The LaRem line was that there should be no place for overt displays of religious symbols on electoral campaign documents, Stanislas Guerini, the party's general secretary, responded. Shortly afterwards, he retracted its backing.\"The moment you wear a religious symbol on a campaign poster, it becomes a political act,\" LaRem spokesperson Roland Lescure told Reuters. \"I prefer that our candidates and our elected officials speak to all citizens.\"French law does not prohibit wearing the hijab or other religious symbols in images on election fliers.LaRem lawmaker Coralie Dubost expressed regret at her party's stance: \"She should have a place in our party whether she wears a headscarf or not.\"In the marketplace, housepainter Karim el Ameraouy wished Zemmahi luck.\"A veil doesn't stop you being French,\" he said.(Reporting by Elizabeth Pineau; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Giles Elgood)\n",

Vidyananthan said MAF has agreed to set up a field hospital in front of the hospital's main building here and is expected to begin operations on June 17.“The MAF will be assembling their assets and equipment by Wednesday (June 9) to provide 60 hospital beds and four intensive care unit (ICU) beds in stages.“They were called in to provide assistance because there was an increase of some 30% of Covid-19 patients at government hospitals in Johor Baru since the start of Hari Raya.“This has contributed to the increase in bed occupancy for Covid-19 patients to more than 95%, including the ICU wards.“The armed forces will deploy three officers and 30 paramedics, in addition to the HSA medical staff at the field hospital, ” he said in a statement on Tuesday (June 8).As of Sunday (June 6), 1,247 Covid-19 patients were being treated in the state’s government hospitals. They comprised 105 patients in ICU wards, where 82 of them were on ventilators.He added that there were 24 patients receiving treatment for Covid-19 at several private hospitals here, where two were placed on ventilators.Vidyananthan said the HSA field hospital’s length of operation depends on the Covid-19 situation in the state, especially in Johor Baru and the surrounding districts.Besides MAF and the Health Ministry, the field hospital also involves the National Disaster Management Agency (Nadma) and Johor government through its disaster management committee, he added.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The country's goal to achieve Covid-19 herd immunity by December will be dampened if Malaysians become picky in choosing what vaccines they want, say health experts.Universiti Malaya Department of Social and Preventive Medicine Faculty of Medicine's Prof Dr Moy Foong Ming said the vaccination process response rate will be reduced if people start to choose what vaccine brands they want.This, she said, will slow down the country’s chance of achieving herd immunity.“There is a lot of information available in explaining the efficacy and effectiveness of various brands of vaccines,\" she said.She added that one particular brand of vaccine may not be as good as another in reducing transmission, but it is equally good - more than 90% - in preventing serious complications and hospitalisation, as well as death.“This information perhaps should be presented in ways that are easier to understand by the less informed groups, ” she said when contacted on Tuesday (June 7).Dr Moy said doctors from general practitioner (GP) clinics who are much more in contact with the public should play a bigger role in promoting vaccination and allaying public’s fear of certain vaccines.She suggested that NGOs should also do more outreach programmes on these issues.“The government also should be more transparent with the data on vaccinations for different brands, and the number and types of side effects experienced as well as breakthrough cases and its outcome. With these data, we may be able to gain the public’s trust on the various brands of vaccines, ” she said.Previously, coordinating minister for the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme Khairy Jamaluddin urged those who have vaccination appointments not to reject a particular vaccine in favour of another, after several senior citizens who turned up for their vaccination appointments at the KL Convention Centre vaccination centre had rejected one brand of vaccine and wanted another brand instead.Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia epidemiologist Assoc Prof Dr Azmi Mohd Tamil pointed out that certain parts of the Malaysian population are rejecting not only one brand of vaccine, but all forms of Covid-19 vaccinations.“This movement has gained traction due to ignorance and misinformation in the social media and communities. Therefore, the ability of this country to achieve herd immunity in a short period is not in sight.\"It is unfortunate that such ignorance and wrongful fears are concentrated only in certain parts of the population.\"Efforts must be made to identify the cause of vaccine hesitancy and community leaders must be roped in to help their communities register and be vaccinated, ” he said.Dr Azmi believed that the desire to register for the vaccine is very low, especially in the Malay-belt states.“The vaccine hesitancy in such states among those already registered are very high. Kelantan and Kedah have more than 10, 000 defaulters each, ” he said.He added that those who are eager to be vaccinated must be facilitated to get inoculated, otherwise the frustration among these groups will also grow.International Islamic University of Malaysia public health specialist Asst Prof Dr Mohammad Farhan Rusli said receiving any brand or type of vaccine will reduce an individual's risk of developing severe Covid-19 and will help free ICUs, hospitals and wards.He assured the public that they do not have to be afraid of the vaccines, as all the vaccines have received the World Health Organisation (WHO) Emergency Use Approval.“The vaccines have also been extensively checked by the NPRA on its safety use, ” he said, adding that the best vaccine is the one that is available to them.\n",

We can’t take what comes out in the media as a directive from the ministry, ” he said when contacted on Tuesday (June 8).Ameer noted that currently, all items considered as “non-essential” are still cordoned off in stores.“We haven’t opened it up yet unless we receive clear direction as we don’t want to be summoned. Until there is a new SOP and guidelines from the ministry, we still have to wait, ” he said.He added that a movement control order (MCO) is to restrict people from moving about and once people have done that, they should not be restricted from buying what they want as an essential consumer item differs from one person to another.“Shopping centres and department stores should remain closed, that I agree, as it is to limit the number of people out and about.\"But part of the shopping centre where there is a supermarket which is open should be allowed to sell everything in it, ” he said.Ameer also hoped that the government would come out with the guidelines first before making any statements to prevent businesses from “running helter-skelter”.However, Malaysian Pharmacists Society (MPS) president Amrahi Buang said there was never an issue from the beginning.But some pharmacies decided to implement the separations in fear that they would breach the SOP and be fined.“With the new information by the NSC, it's a non-issue. By right... we just follow the NSC’s decision, ” he said.On Monday (June 7), NSC director-general Datuk Mohd Rabin Basir clarified that convenience stores and grocery stores are allowed to sell all the products they have in-store during the lockdown period from June 1 to 14.Mohd Rabin’s comment came after the ministry, in its latest standard operating procedure (SOP) announcement, stated that stores could not sell non-essential goods.Some businesses then resorted to cordoning off parts of their retail space that offered such products for fear of being fined.\n",

The government has made a policy of giving vaccinations to the sectors allowed to operate, ” he said after jointly chairing the Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) meeting with Johor Mentri Besar Datuk Hasni Mohammad here on Tuesday (June 8).Khairy, who is Science, Technology and Innovation Minister, also said the government would be opening more industry PPV for other sectors in stages.“Besides Pengerang, another PPV would be opened in Johor Baru at Mount Austin by the end of this month before we open for other sectors such as plantation, construction and retail, ” he added.He also said that the government expected to complete vaccinating more than three million people living in Johor by the end of October.Khairy said the target could be achieved if the country does not face any hiccups in obtaining vaccine supplies.He added that the ministry was working closely with the Johor government in coming up with various strategies to make sure the state was able to reach the target.“To achieve the three million target, we need to increase the daily vaccine recipients from 14,000 a day to 50,000 a day.“We will do it in stages where, by September, we aim to vaccinate 30,000 individuals per day, ” he said.Khairy added that among the strategies discussed was the inclusion of more private healthcare players in the national immunisation programme.“The state government suggested opening up more mega PPV at each district in Johor and we will be looking into the suggestion.“We will also be getting private hospitals and clinics as we need more PPV and a bigger workforce, ” he said, adding that the Pfizer-BioNTech manufacturer has given an assurance it will supply 25 million doses to the country by the third quarter of this year.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Only breweries and shops focused on liquor are not allowed to operate during the current movement control order, says Datuk Seri Alexander Nanta Linggi.The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister dismissed claims by Bangi MP Dr Ong Kian Ming who claimed that the ministry remained silent on several issues including the sale of alcohol and permission to sell cigarettes.\"It must be stressed here that stores selling only liquor products are not allowed to operate.\"The sale of cigarettes in convenience stores is allowed as the stores have been listed as essential,\" he said in a statement on Tuesday (June 8).Last week, there was some confusion as to whether there was an outright ban on liquor sales as pictures of closed-off alcohol sections in shops went viral on social media.This was compounded by a police raid on a store in Brickfields that had reportedly violated its operating permit as it only sold liquor, and not food and beverages as stated.Nanta Linggi said he had issued an official statement on May 31 to explain the list of essential services under the trade sector that are allowed to operate during the lockdown from June 1 to 14 nationwide.\"In the statement, the list of essential services authorised to operate is clearly stated, in addition to the standard operating procedures (SOP) that must be observed by all parties involved.\"Convenience stores or mini markets as well as grocery stores are categorised as essential and given permission to operate.\"It simply means that all items in these convenience stores, therefore, can be sold to consumers, including alcohol and cigarettes,\" he explained.He also noted that he had made a similar explanation to the media and the statement was also shared on his Facebook page.The ministry took note of the National Security Council decision that allows the sale of liquor in convenience stores, given that the premises is licensed to sell such items, he said.\"Just like in convenience stores, liquor is also sold in supermarket beverage sections and therefore, it can be sold to consumers,\" he added.On the issue of car workshops, he also clarified in the same media statement that workshop services, maintenance and spare parts are listed as activities that are allowed to operate with the capacity of employees limited to 60%.However, car wash services are not allowed.\"I hope this explanation can provide beneficial input to everyone involved.\"This is a difficult time faced by all parties. I sincerely hope that each and every one of us will stop sensationalising various issues that can cause unrest,\" he said.\n",

      "SEREMBAN: Negri Sembilan MCA is urging the state government to use its reserves to buy Covid-19 vaccines to help speed up the inoculation process in the state.Negri Sembilan MCA chief Siow Koi Voon said the state administration should set aside some funds from its reserves of more than RM1bil for the purpose.“The state government often says that it has managed to raise the reserves to more than RM1bil.“We urge the state government to put these funds to good use for the benefit of the people and help save lives, ” he said when met at the state MCA office here on Tuesday (June 8).Siow said this was important as the number of cases reported in Negri Sembilan was among the highest in the country.Prior to this, state health exco S. Veerapan said only 79,872 of the 486,200 people who have registered for the vaccine in Negri Sembilan have received the first dose as of June 2.He said the process was too slow and this was due to the shortage of supply.Veerapan said although some vaccination centres had the capacity to inoculate up to 500 people a day each, only 300 were being given the jabs.Apart from the vaccination centres, there are five private hospitals and eight private clinics in the state authorised to administer the vaccines.On a separate matter, Siow urged Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Aminuddin Harun to explain if Invest NS (formerly known as NS Investment Centre) was going ahead with a proposed plan to offer Covid-19 vaccine package to those in the manufacturing and services sectors in the state.“Based on media reports, Invest NS is offering a RM380 package for the vaccine to those in the two sectors.“This should not happen when the vaccine is being offered for free by the Federal authorities, ” Siow said, adding that the state government should clarify this soon due to the confusion it has caused.On Saturday, Veerapan said a statement which has since gone viral claiming that Invest NS was offering the package was fake as it was issued without his knowledge or approval.However, Veerapan said he did receive queries from the manufacturing sector asking if they could buy vaccines for their workers.He said some industries were considering this so that they can run at full capacity.Siow said Aminuddin needs to clarify this as state industrialisation committee chairman Datuk Dr Mohamad Rafie Ab Malek has been quoted as saying that the programme was not cancelled but only deferred due to a shortage in the supply of the vaccine and price and logistics-related matters.\n",

      "JOHOR BARU: An elderly couple drove for almost two hours from Batu Pahat to get their AstraZeneca shots at the mega vaccination centre (PPV) at the Persada Interna-tional Convention Centre here.Retired school principal Idris Ahmad, 67, and his wife Azmah Hairun, 64, were determined to be vaccinated so they went on a 127km journey from their home in Batu Pahat.Under the ongoing national lockdown, inter-district and interstate travel are allowed for people who have vaccination appointments.Idris said they left their home after subuh (dawn) prayers just to be at the PPV in time.“There were not many vehicles along the highway due to the movement control order. It was a nice, slow drive.“Both of us had looked forward to getting the vaccine, ” he said at the PPV here yesterday.Idris said he was very happy that both he and his wife got the same appointment dates when their children registered their names through the MySejahtera app.Azmah, a retired teacher, urged those who had yet to be registered for the vaccine to immediately do so, which would help protect Malaysians against Covid-19.“I told all my family members to get vaccinated. But if they are still stubborn, then they should not come and see me at all.“If you really love your family, get vaccinated as there is nothing to be afraid of, ” she said, adding that it took them less than half an hour to get their AstraZeneca jabs.Checks by The Star at the PPV in Persada found people starting to form a queue as early as 7am.The presence of army personnel together with police, Fire and Rescue Department, Civil Defence Force and People’s Volunteer Corps (Rela) and volunteers from non-governmental groups helped manage the large crowd.An express lane is also provided for the elderly and disabled.Vaccine recipients would have to go through five different stations at the PPV, with the first for symptom and temperature screening, station two for registration, station three for consultation and authorisation, station four for vaccination, and station five for observation.The Covid-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF) had previously announced that the second round of administering the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine would be held from June 7 to July 27 at PPVs in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Penang, Johor and Sarawak.\n",

      "ALOR SETAR: While not admitting he has violated the standard operating procedure, Kedah Mentri Besar Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor (pic) says he’s prepared to face any consequences for allegedly test driving a car at Autocity Juru, Penang.He said it was not up to the people on social media, his detractors or supporters to decide whether he was right or wrong in this matter, but rather the established law enforcement system in the country.“I’m not saying I’m not wrong, but if there is a breach of SOP, it’s a serious case. And I apologise because it happened by chance, ” he said at a press conference after visiting the Covid-19 Quarantine and Treatment Centre (PKRC) at the Education Complex’s Al-Farabi Hall here yesterday.He said he would give his full cooperation to the police and, if his actions were found to have gone against the law, would pay the fine as well.“I am also willing to pay the fines for others linked to this action.“The police will take my statement this evening (yesterday). If they find it an offence, maybe it will only be a fine, so I will pay it.“If the car salesman is fined too, I will pay it, ” he added.In the incident last week, Muhammad Sanusi said he did not intend to buy a new car but was only attracted to the vehicle, which was placed at the exhibition area when he stopped by a nearby shop.“I did not even test drive the vehicle; the salesman drove.“After that, I went and looked at other (models) of the vehicle but I did not get inside.“When the door to the second vehicle was opened, I saw someone recording us, ” he added.Muhammad Sanusi said he also forgave the woman who is believed to have made the issue viral on social media.“Maybe she could have asked nicely what was going on at that time, and I would have answered nicely as well, ” he said.\n",

      "HANOI (Vietnam News/ANN): There is no evidence Vietnam has exported dumped or subsidised precision pipes and tubes in Australia, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Trade Remedies Authority of Vietnam (TRAV).There appear to be insufficient grounds for the publication of a dumping duty notice and a countervailing duty notice in respect of precision pipes and tubes exported from Vietnam, TRAV quoted the Australian Anti-Dumping Commission (ADC) as saying in its newly-released Preliminary Affirmative Determination, following a probe into the products from Vietnam, Taiwan (China), China, and the Republic of Korea.The ADC found no evidence of significantly different prices for raw materials in Vietnam compared to other Asian countries nor official Government plans to control or otherwise influence Vietnam's steel industry.The ADC said it was also unaware of any intervention by the Vietnamese Government affecting the normal value of the product.There exists no evidence of a continuing impact from steel master plans developed by the Vietnamese Government as these plans have been invalid since 2019, according to the findings.Recommendations will be sent by the ADC to Australia’s Minister for Industry, Science and Technology for final determination.According to statistics compiled by the General Department of Vietnam Customs, the export turnover of Vietnamese precision steel pipes to Australia in 2019 topped US$15 million.Review of imported galvanised steel measuresThe Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) has announced an end-of-term review of anti-dumping measures on galvanised steel products imported from China and the Republic of Korea.The ministry issued a decision in 2017 on the application of official anti-dumping measures for the products over five years from April 14, 2017, to April 13 next year.According to the Law on Foreign Trade Management and Decree 10/2018/NĐ-CP, for the end-of-term review, the investigation authority will assess the possibility of imported goods being dumped and the possibility the domestic industry will suffer material injury or be threatened if anti-dumping measures are removed.It will also consider the causal relationship between the possibility of dumping and damage suffered by the domestic industry, as well as the necessity, rationality and socio-economic impacts of the continued use of anti-dumping measures.The MoIT also stated the review will serve as a basis for the investigation authority to collect information and evaluate domestic producers' production and business activities, balance supply and demand, and monitor price movements of galvanised steel products in Vietnam, especially as the steel market is experiencing strong fluctuations.It can make recommendations on whether to continue applying anti-dumping measures or adjust the level of application in accordance with the law and based on the information and practical data collected. — Vietnam News/Asia News Network\n",
