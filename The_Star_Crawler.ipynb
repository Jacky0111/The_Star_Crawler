      "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Latin American and Caribbean nations should aspire to a regional block similar to the European Union, Mexico's president said on Saturday, in a bid to wrest diplomatic influence away from the Washington-based Organization of American States (OAS).The host of the summit, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, told nearly 20 presidents and prime ministers attending the meeting of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) at the gathering's opening ceremony that the block could better boost the region's inequality-stricken economies as well as confront health and other crisis.\"In these times, CELAC can become the principal instrument to consolidate relations between our Latin American and Caribbean nations,\" he said at the opening ceremony, held at the ornate national palace in downtown Mexico City.\"We should build in the American continent something similar to what was the economic community that was the beginning of the current European Union,\" he added, emphasizing the need to respect the sovereignty of the region's mostly Spanish-speaking nations.The summit's kickoff focused attention on the region's center-left leaders, including Peru's new president, Pedro Castillo, Cuba's Miguel Diaz-Canel and Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.No representative of Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro attended.But some fissures emerged, including criticism from Uruguay's center-right President Luis Lacalle, who said his participation in the summit should not be interpreted as an embrace of some of the region's more authoritarian regimes.\"We are worried and look gravely at what's happening in Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela,\" he said, ticking off what he described as repressive actions by those governments, including the jailing of political opponents.The leaders gathered at the invitation of Lopez Obrador with a stated aim of weakening the Washington-based OAS, the long-standing regional body that excludes Cuba and is viewed with skepticism by many of Latin America's center-left leaders.In his remarks, Bolivian President Luis Arce called for a global agreement to lower debts for poor countries while Cuba's Diaz-Canel spoke out for an end to the U.S. trade embargo against the communist-run island.Venezuela's late President Hugo Chavez helped set up CELAC in 2011, and his embattled successor Maduro arrived in the Mexican capital late on Friday in a surprise addition to the assembled heads of state .(Reporting by David Alire Garcia and Noe Torres; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n",

Nevertheless, a specialist will make the report.\"Police have also opened an investigation paper. When something like this happens, an investigation will immediately be carried out, just like what Selangor Criminal Investigations Department head SAC Nik Ezanee Mohd Faisal had explained. That is the focus of our investigations,” he said.Arjunaidi said the policeman who was on duty when the incident happened had been called for further investigations.Earllier, the media had reported on Sept 8 that lorry driver T. Vinaiyagar, 49, was detained in BantingHowever, his wife, N. Navaneetham, 35. claimed that she did not receive any information about her husband’s detention.A post-mortem which was carried out stated that the cause of death was due to ulcer in the stomach. However, Navaneetham claimed she saw swellings on her husband’s body.In another development, Arjunaidi said the four policemen who were detained in a raid at an entertainment outlet in Klang on Sept 11 have been re-assigned while waiting for a full report for drug abuse offence.\"They have been automatically reassigned and had disciplinary action taken against them and were compounded for failure to comply with the SOP.\"For drug-related offences, action will be taken after we have received the full report from the experts,” he said.The media had earlier reported that four policemen who were on duty in Selangor were among the 35 individuals detained in a raid on an entertainment outlet in Klang.Preliminary urine screening tests found a total of 19 people tested positive, including the four policemen. - Bernama\n",

      "HAMILTON, Ontario (Reuters) - Canada's election is in a dead heat two days before the Sept. 20 vote, according to a new poll on Saturday, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Conservative rival both campaigned in the same seat-rich region to scour up votes.The latest Sondage Leger poll conducted for the Journal de Montreal and the National Post newspapers put the Conservatives one percentage point ahead of Trudeau's Liberals, with 33% over 32%.The tightness of the race has put the focus on turnout, with low turnout historically favouring the Conservatives. The Leger poll put the third-place left-leaning New Democratic Party at 19%.Trudeau, 49, called an early election, seeking to convert approval for his government's handling of the pandemic into a parliamentary majority. But he is now scrambling to save his job, with Canadians questioning the need for an early election amid a fourth pandemic wave.On Saturday, the Liberals announced they would drop a candidate over a 2019 sexual assault charge that the party said was not disclosed to them. Kevin Vuong, a naval reservist running in an open Liberal seat in downtown Toronto, denied the allegations on Friday, noting the charge was withdrawn.\"Mr. Vuong will no longer be a Liberal candidate, and should he be elected, he will not be a member of the Liberal caucus,\" the party said in a statement on Saturday.Earlier this month, Liberal member of parliament Raj Saini ended his re-election campaign amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards female staffers.Both Trudeau and his Conservative rival Erin O'Toole were campaigning around the Toronto region on Saturday.O'Toole, 48, is slated to appear in a Conservative-held riding west of Toronto that was closely fought during the 2019 election.The area’s member of Parliament, who is not running again, came under fire last spring for saying COVID-19 lockdowns were the \"single greatest breach of our civil liberties since the internment camps during WW2.\"(Reporting by Anna Mehler Paperny; Editing by Daniel Wallis)\n",

      "KOTA KINABALU: Centre Point Sabah will not be able to proceed with the construction of a connection linking its building to the multi-million ringgit Sky Bridge this year as a portion of the shopping complex's funds have been used to fight Covid-19.Centre Point general manager Megan Liu said that the pace of business had slowed down for many of the mall's tenants, while some have had to close their shops as they were unable to sustain operations.Liu also said that Centre Point's management had also assisted their tenants by granting service charge rebates totalling over RM1.44mil thus far.“As such, the allocated budget for connecting the KK Skybridge project has been utilized for that purpose, and also for several charity projects such as the food bank programs, blood donation campaigns, and sponsorships to frontliner personnel,” she said in a statement on Saturday (Sept 18).“Hence, the management of Centre Point Sabah Shopping Mall has decided to postpone the construction of linking to the KK Skybridge to next year, with the support from over 400 business owners of the mall,” Liu added.She also said that the movement control orders and the closing of borders have led to a lack of visitors to Sabah in general and the shopping complex specifically.“The current situation shows that it is not possible for businesses to recover and would only deteriorate further this year,” she said.Liu said that she hopes local authorities such as the City Hall and state government could consider helping in terms of allocating some funds for the construction of the entrance.She said the management has decided to put the plans to construct the opening linking the Skybridge first, and to focus on helping mall operators get back on their feet.Liu also called on the public to pay more attention to the needs of hospitals and frontliners battling this pandemic above other matters first given the increasing number of cases in Sabah.She said that many quarantine centres are almost full and medical facilities are lacking essentials such as intensive care beds and an oxygen supply.“The management’s current project is to contribute some of these medical facilities to hospitals,” she said.Those who are interested in donating may contact the marketing event team, Winnie or Zia at 0117 412 8785, or to send an email to info@centrepointsabah.com, she added.Earlier, mayor Noorliza Awang Alip said according to the initial agreement between the mall and the state, the construction of the opening from Centre Point Mall would be done six months after the project is completed.This RM31.5mil project is a 440-metre Sky Bridge equipped with escalators, an elevator for the disabled and 20 kiosks connecting Asia City, Api-Api Commercial Centre, Warisan Square and Oceanus Mall among other facilities.Construction of the bridge started in April 2017, but was halted in between works due to financial constraints among other reasons, and was only completed this year and opened to the public officially on Sept 9.\n",

      "JOHOR BARU: Johor Ruler Sultan Ibrahim Ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar (pic) has expressed his pleasure in seeing two outstanding Johoreans striking success on the international entertainment scene, namely singer-songwriter Gin Lee and comedian cum actor Ronny Chieng.His Majesty congratulated the two for their remarkable achievements on the global stage.“I’d like to thank them for bringing glory to Johor in their own way and wish them continued success.“I believe Johor has many talents who have yet to be found and nurtured. Let them be an example and inspiration of what Johor can achieve, and also spur our own local arts and entertainment scene to greater heights,” His Majesty said in a statement posted on Sultan Ibrahim’s official Facebook page here on Saturday (Sept 18).Gin Lee emerged champion at Malaysia's Universal Music songwriting competition at just 18-years-old and released her debut Mandarin album titled ‘One & Only’ on Dec 29, 2009.Two years later, Gin Lee moved to Hong Kong and debuted as a Cantopop singer after self-learning Cantonese and released several chart-topping songs, including an album ‘beGin’ which won Best Female Singer at the 2020 AIM Chinese Music Awards presented by the Malaysian Recording Industry Association.The 34-year old recently took the stage with one of Hong Kong’s Four Heavenly Kings, Jacky Cheung at the Miss Hong Kong 2021 pageant, singing their duet ‘Let the Street Lights Rest When the Sun Rises’.Meanwhile Ronny Chieng, 35 were cast in ‘Crazy Rich Asians’ with fellow Malaysian star, Henry Goulding and Marvel’s ‘Shang Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings’ set to release on Oct 7 in Malaysia this year.Chieng started out as a standup comedian since his university days, where he performed with Trevor Noah in 2013, and later proceeded to become a senior correspondent on The Daily Show hosted by the latter.In 2016, Chieng co-wrote and starred in the sitcom ‘Ronny Chieng: International Student’, based on his own experience as a Malaysian student at the University of Melbourne and he was named one of ‘10 Comics to Watch’ by Variety in that same year.Netflix has also started streaming his stand-up special, “Asian Comedian Destroys America!” in 2019.He has clearly not forgotten his roots as seen in a Malaysia Day promo video for ‘Shang Chi’, where he flaunted his Malaysian passport and spoke fluent Malay by saying “Johor Bahru kampung saya. Saya anak Malaysia”.Chieng showcased his use of ‘lah’ and ‘meh’ in his daily conversations and his ability to still order at a ‘kopitiam’ like a pro.\n",

Saravanan (pic) said following discussions, the ministry saw the need to protect the group who had been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, especially when husbands as the family’s breadwinner, could not go out to work.\"However, this will depend on the government's financial position... in this pandemic situation, if the husband is out of work and the wife has some chronic illness, they have no safety net.\"As a government that cares and prioritises the people’s welfare, we recommend that this move be considered to provide two million B40 housewives with a free safety net protection,\" he said after presenting Socso’s benefits to the widow of the late Vijaya Kumaran T. Veerasamy here today.Vijaya Kumaran died on May 21 after suffering brain damage following a road accident on April 12, last year.Prior to this, the deceased's medical treatment, which included an implant surgery amounting to RM23,000, was fully paid by Socso.Earlier the government had agreed to make contribution payments to some 150,000 women in the B40 group registered under e-Kasih.Meanwhile, on labour shortage in the plantation sector, Saravanan said, currently the country needed 100,000 workers in the sector but the ministry would continue to give priority to locals to fill the job vacancies.\"Foreign workers will be hired as a last resort,” he said adding that priority would continue to be given to locals, despite pressure from the plantation sector employers and the fact that this could affect national income. - Bernama\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Budget hotel operators want the government to regulate online travel agencies (OTAs), saying that the industry would not be able to sustain itself in the long run without regulations especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.The Malaysian Budget and Business Hotel Association (MyBHA) also said that there was a need to enforce the short term residential accommodation (STRA) guidelines.MyBHA deputy president Sri Ganesh Michiel said the commissions OTAs charged to the hotel operators meant that they did not get enough profit for the continuity of their business.He said that the price war among the OTAs drove prices of hotel rooms down further.\"The operational costs are very high but the selling price of the rooms are low,” he said during a virtual press conference on Saturday (Sept 18).An OTA is an online marketplace that allows consumers to book travel products and services, including hotels and flights.Ganesh asked why the government could control bank interests and even the price of Covid-19 test kits but not the commissions earned by OTAs.\"The use of online services has increased and all efforts to revive the hotel and tourism industry will not be successful if the government fails to resolve the threats we are facing, especially those because of digitalisation,\" he said.He said that these OTAs also conducted promotions without any notice or consent from operators and suspended the accounts of any hotels that refuse to cooperate with them.He said that the whole industry had to be united before they could stop using these OTA platforms.He said that 90% of the public were using these platforms as they were cheaper and that the rate of walk-ins had become less.“If we stop using these agencies, our competitors will get the business. We rely on them to get our rooms filled. If we use these agencies, our profits drop by almost 60% to 70%\" he said.Sri Ganesh also said that customers were also preferring to opt for non-hotel condominium or residential units, where there was no need for operating permits or business licenses.He added that they did not have to pay any taxes to the government and hoped that the matter could be addressed in the upcoming 2022 budget.\n",

      "HANOI, Sept 18 (Vietnam News/ANN): Textile, garment and footwear industries are still facing many difficulties due the Covid-19 pandemic, and unable to recover production and business in the short term.These are large industries that have contributed large parts to the national export value and provided jobs for many workers.However, many localities are implementing pandemic preventive measures, especially in southern cities and provinces where enterprises are suffering serious impact from the pandemic on production.A large textile and garment enterprise with about 5,000 employees has had to suspend production for a month. However, it still has to pay VNĐ17.5 billion per month in depreciation expenses, insurance premiums for employees, bank loan interest and Covid-19 testing of employees. This figure includes air freight for urgent orders and salaries of employees though workers stay at home.Meanwhile, a footwear enterprise with about 9,000 employees has spent US$1 million to implement anti-pandemic measures. It has also faced increased input costs of 5-10 per cent.However, garment and footwear enterprises said the highest cost was still fines for late delivery. If the delivery of products is delayed, besides higher transport costs by plane, they could be fined hundreds of billions of đồng. Along with that, they would not be able to receive orders for the next season.In order to keep orders for production next year, Phan Thi Thanh Xuan, general secretary of the Vietnam Leather, Footwear and Handbag Association, said many enterprises had found solutions to maintain production and ensure delivery.The association proposed a gradual recovery of production for the footwear industry. Initially, enterprises would resume about 30 per cent of capacity. Then, they would continue to gradually increase production capacity to 50-70 per cent.Xuan said the industry’s prospect was not positive until year end and possibly next year. Now, many enterprises were facing difficulties and could not continue production or meet set targets in production and business.Vu Duc Giang, chairman of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association, said that if the pandemic continued complicated development, textile, garment and footwear enterprises would be unable to maintain production and keep customers. This was a huge challenge for the textile, leather and footwear industries.\"Besides that, workers at enterprises have also left large production centres in the south such as HCM City, Bình Duong and Dong Nai, to avoid the pandemic, causing enterprises to have a serious labour shortage,\" Giang said.According to the Vietnam National Textile and Garment Group, an important issue is to ensure human resources in the context of changed production plans, shortages of Covid-19 vaccines and an unpredictable pandemic.The Ministry of Industry and Trade said the industrial production index of the whole industry in August was estimated to decrease by 4.2 per cent month on month and 7.4 per cent year on year.Export turnover decreased by 9.2 per cent for textiles and garments and 38.5 per cent for footwear year on year.In order to restore production of the textile, garment and footwear industries, the ministry would focus on removing difficulties and providing support for factories to maintain and restore production.Initially, solutions would aim at completing signed export contracts and attracting more orders for the year-end shopping season in the European and US markets. - Vietnam News/ANN\n",

      "VIENTIANE, Sept 18 (Bloomberg): Bats dwelling in limestone caves in northern Laos were found to carry coronaviruses that share a key feature with SARS-CoV-2, moving scientists closer to pinpointing the cause of Covid-19.Researchers at France’s Pasteur Institute and the University of Laos looked for viruses similar to the one that causes Covid among hundreds of horseshoe bats. They found three with closely matched receptor binding domains -- the part of the coronavirus’s spike protein used to bind to human ACE-2, the enzyme it targets to cause an infection.The finding, reported in a paper released Friday that’s under consideration for publication by a Nature journal, shows that viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 exist in nature, including in several Rhinolophus, or horseshoe bat, species. The research supports the hypothesis that the pandemic began from a spillover of a bat-borne virus. About 1,000 such infections may be occurring daily in southern China and Southeast Asia in areas with dense populations of bats from the Rhinolophus genus, a study Tuesday found.The three viruses found in Laos, dubbed BANAL-52, BANAL-103, and BANAL-236, are \"the closest ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 known to date,” said Marc Eloit, head of pathogen discovery at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and co-authors. \"These viruses may have contributed to SARS-CoV-2’s origin and may intrinsically pose a future risk of direct transmission to humans.”The receptor binding domains of three Laos coronaviruses are closer to that of SARS-CoV-2 than to the RaTG13 virus identified in Rhinopholus affinis bats from the Mojiang mineshaft in Yunnan province, that was regarded as the pandemic strain’s closest match. The BANAL-236 virus has an almost identical receptor binding domain to the pandemic virus, according to the paper.\"The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 looked unusual when it was first discovered because there were so few viruses to compare it to,” said Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney, who wasn’t involved in the research.Tracing Ancestors\"Now that we are sampling more from nature, we are starting to find these closely related bits of gene sequence,” Holmes said in an email Saturday. \"Eventually, with more sampling, the natural ancestry of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome will be revealed.”None of the bat viruses isolated in Laos harbors a so-called furin cleavage site in the spike that facilitates cell entry. It’s a feature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has led some scientists to theorize that it was created in a laboratory.No evidence supporting the lab-leak theory has emerged. Last month, the U.S. intelligence community ruled out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was developed by China as a biological weapon, but no consensus was reached on its origin.The lack of furin cleavage may be explained by insufficient sampling in bats, or by acquisition of the furin cleavage site during chains of transmission in an alternate animal host, or during unreported circulation in humans in the early stages of the outbreak when the virus may have caused few symptoms, the authors said.\"Our results pinpoint the presence of new bat sarbecoviruses that seem to have the same potential for infecting humans as early strains of SARS-CoV-2,” they said.Guano CollectorsPeople who spend time in or close to caves, such as guano collectors, are particularly at risk of being exposed. Further investigations are needed to assess if people exposed to bats have been infected by one of these viruses and whether they have antibodies that may provide protection against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infections.\"This paper is really interesting and we need more research like it,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s technical lead for Covid-19, in an email.The researchers studied 645 bats from 46 species captured on four sites -- in Fueng and Meth districts of Vientiane province, and in Namor and Xay districts in Oudomxay province -- between July 2020 and January 2021. The bats live in the limestone karstic terrain common to China, Laos, and Vietnam in the Indochina peninsula.The paper highlights the diversity of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses present in bats in Southeast Asia, Holmes said.\"Continual sampling is the only way to understand the origins of this virus and it is important that more sampling is done throughout China as this remains the most likely place of origin,” he said. \"This study emphasizes that bat coronaviruses that have the potential to infect humans readily exist in nature and could emerge any point. This is the clear risk for the future.” - Bloomberg\n",

      "BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Sept 18 (Borneo Bulletin/ANN): Flooding is the most serious climate change impact for some Southeast Asian nations, according to a climate survey on South-East Asians’ attitudes and perceptions that has published.The survey conducted by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute gathered responses from Brunei, Vietnam, the Philippines, Myanmar, Malaysia, Laos and Indonesia.Respondents also suggested that businesses in Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam should adopt green practices.Eighty per cent of respondents from Vietnam and 77.9 per cent from the Philippines agreed that climate change is “a serious and immediate threat” to their countries, while 58 per cent from Brunei said the issue must be monitored.The survey also revealed that Southeast Asians are only marginally optimistic about the potential economic benefits of adopting climate change measures and policies. In addition, almost half of respondents feel that the stimulus measures and Covid-19 spending by respective governments did not contribute to a green recovery.ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute conducted the second iteration of its South-East Asia Climate Outlook Survey from June 11 to August 2.Designed to gather insights on the perspectives of South-East Asian citizens towards a variety of climate change issues, the online survey covered topics including climate change impacts, urban mitigation and adaptation, low-carbon transitions and partnership on climate action.It drew a total of 610 responses from citizens of all Asean member states, and its findings provided a general sense of the prevailing views of Southeast Asian citizens towards climate change issues.About a third of respondents identified the European Union (EU) as having demonstrated global climate leadership, but a substantial portion felt that no country had fulfilled the role of climate leader.However, when asked which country could potentially play a more proactive role in climate issues, respondents’ top three choices were the EU, Japan and the United States.At the regional level, Asean’s effectiveness in tackling climate action is in question as the majority of respondents question the regional organisation’s role in climate change.Commenting on the results, Director and CEO of ISEAS– Yusof Ishak Institute Choi Shing Kwok said, “This is the second year we have conducted the survey.The results show that South-East Asians believe that more should be done to address climate change issues, with a majority viewing climate change to be as much of a crisis as the Covid-19 pandemic.“Survey respondents also believe that better and more innovative climate change policies can result in higher economic competitiveness, which will translate into strong support for governments and private companies pursuing climate change initiatives in the region.”Coordinator of the Climate Change in South-East Asia Programme at ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute Sharon Seah said the survey confirmed that climate change remained top priority for Southeast Asia despite the ongoing pandemic.Respondents were unequivocal about the role of governments, businesses and individuals in reducing carbon emissions and the need to cut reliance on coal as soon as possible. This was accompanied by an emerging consensus on the potential of a renewable energy transition. - Borneo Bulletin/ANN\n",

The ministry also reported seven new deaths and 492 recoveries.As of Sept 18, Cambodia had recorded a total of 103,482 Covid-19 cases with 96,767 recoveries and 2,096 fatalities.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Hun Sen had announced that he had advised the national Covid-19 vaccination committee to determine whether to make a third dose – or booster shot – a part of the standard inoculation protocol for Covid-19.“We have to adopt this as a standard, or else herd immunity will remain elusive,” he proclaimed at the launch of Covid-19 vaccination campaign for children aged 6-11.Hun Sen cautioned against using antibody tests to check for immunity from SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen that causes Covid-19, citing inconsistent results from person to person.“But no matter what, being vaccinated is better than not. My doctor drew my blood to test for antibodies and observed that I had low levels,” he said. The prime minister took his booster shot on September 14.Phnom Penh and Kandal province next month are collectively set to be the first region to make booster shots available to the general public aged 18 and over. Other provinces will later allow people to get a third dose four months after their last jab.The prime minister said Cambodia is also keeping tabs on global developments to determine whether a fourth dose is necessary, noting that the government would shoulder the costs of acquiring additional jabs as needed.“We have to keep an eye on this and follow pertinent developments around the world and the observed immunogenicity of an additional dose, as well as recommendations from the World Health Organisation.“I understand that one of our foreign allies has already started administering a fourth dose, but I don’t want to name the country,” Hun Sen said, in reference to Turkey. Israel has also placed a fourth dose on the table.The prime minister also signalled that he was keen to allow all businesses to reopen soon if the Covid-19 situation shows significant signs of improvement.“No one wants to see closures like this, our people want to go out. I first want to reopen the education sector, followed by the service industry ... [including] domestic tourism, our people want to travel on Saturday, Sunday and public holidays,” he said.He pointed out that critical Covid-19 hospitalisations have trended down as vaccination rates rise.The prime minister advocated for home-based care for patients with milder symptoms, but stressed that treatment facilities would remain available to those who need them.He also called on Minister of Education, Youth and Sport Hang Chuon Naron to work out an arrangement with Beijing for Cambodian students enrolled in Chinese universities to return to China and resume in-person classes. - Phnom Penh Post/ANN\n",

      "SINGAPORE, Sept 18 (The Straits Times/ANN): Passengers with travel history to Indonesia within the last 21 days prior to departure for Singapore will be allowed to transit in the Republic again, following a ban which started on July 12.The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (Sept 17) that as the Covid-19 situation in Indonesia has improved, these travellers can transit in Singapore from 11.59pm on Sept 22.As for travellers from Indonesia entering Singapore, MOH said they will be required to undergo an on-arrival Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.They previously needed an antigen rapid test in addition to a PCR test on arrival.These travellers from Indonesia will still be subject to restrictions applicable for visitors from countries deemed by Singapore to be of the highest risk of Covid-19 infections.This means they will have to serve a 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) at a designated facility, and go through multiple Covid-19 tests.MOH also said that Poland and Saudi Arabia will be added to Category II from 11.59pm on Sept 22.Other countries in this category are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea.Travellers departing from countries in this category will have to take a pre-departure PCR test within 48 hours of their flight and another PCR test on arrival.Instead of a 14-day SHN, these travellers will serve seven days in quarantine at a dedicated facility or at home.They will need a final Covid-19 swab test on the final day of the SHN.The revision of the rules for Saudi Arabia and Poland is based on Singapore’s country-risk classification, which has four categories. Places deemed to be of lowest risk of Covid-19 infections are grouped in Category I.Travellers from Hong Kong, Macau, mainland China and Taiwan only need to undergo a PCR test on arrival and are free to move about if the result is negative. Countries of highest risk are grouped in Category IV.MOH said the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, France, Latvia, Portugal and Spain will be added to the Category III list of countries.From 11.59pm on Sept 22, fully vaccinated travellers from these countries may apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their homes or other suitable accommodations.Applications to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities will be considered if the vaccinated traveller has fulfilled criteria such as remaining in the respective countries for the last 21 days prior to arrival in Singapore, and is occupying their respective places of residence alone.For Singapore citizens and permanent residents, the application must be made three days prior to arrival via the SafeTravel website.Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to undergo a 14-day SHN at dedicated facilities.The other countries already in Category III are Austria, Belgium, Japan and Switzerland. Travellers from countries in this category will have to take six Covid-19 swab tests in total.“As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a Covid-19 resilient nation,” said MOH.\n",

      "Manila, Sept 18, 2021 (AFP) - Exhausted nurses in the Philippines are struggling to care for patients as colleagues contract Covid-19 or quit a profession that was dangerously understaffed even before the pandemic.The country is enduring a record rise in infections, fuelled by the Delta variant, with the health department reporting a nursing shortfall of more than 100,000 -- forcing those left to work long hours for little pay on often precarious short-term contracts.\"They are tired and burned out,\" nursing director Lourdes Banaga, at a private hospital south of Manila, told AFP.\"At the start of the pandemic we had almost 200 nurses,\" said Banaga, director for nursing services at the Lipa Medix Medical Center in Batangas province.\"By September that will reduce to 63.\"Official figures show 75,000 nurses are working in public and private Philippine hospitals but roughly 109,000 more are needed.The pandemic has exacerbated a pre-existing lack of nurses, said Maristela Abenojar, president of Filipino Nurses United -- a situation she describes as \"ironic\" in one of the world's biggest exporters of healthcare workers.The \"chronic understaffing\" is down to inadequate salaries, she said.An entry-level nurse in a public hospital can earn 33,575 pesos ($670) per month, official data show.But Abenojar said most were on short-term contracts, earning 22,000 pesos with no benefits such as hazard pay. Meanwhile, those in the private sector were making as little as 8,000 pesos.And many have had enough: About 40 percent of private hospital nurses have resigned since the start of the pandemic, according to the Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines.More than 5,000 nurses have been given the green light to go abroad this year after a Covid-19 ban was replaced with a cap to ensure enough nurses were available in the Philippines.It hasn't worked.\"We can't get additional nurses, we can't compel them to apply,\" said Jose Rene de Grano of the private hospitals association.- 'We feel exhausted' -In recent weeks, health workers have protested over unpaid benefits, including a coronavirus special risk allowance. Abenojar said many were still waiting.President Rodrigo Duterte has asked for patience while the government tries to come up with the money.\"We don't feel cared for,\" said Melbert Reyes of the Philippine Nurses Association.Many hospitals boosted their bed capacity after a virus surge earlier this year threatened to overwhelm them.Official data show coronavirus ward and ICU bed occupancy rates at more than 70 percent nationwide as daily cases often exceed 20,000, fuelled by the hyper-contagious Delta variant.A public hospital in Binan city, near Manila, turned a car park into a ward.\"Many of our nurses are sick and in quarantine,\" medical director Melbril Alonte told AFP.\"We feel exhausted... but we always keep in mind that we have to help our people because... no one else will.\"But due to the nursing shortfall, some facilities -- like the Lipa Medix Medical Center -- have had to slash their bed capacity, and extend their nurses' shifts.Nurse Trixia Bautista said she works up to 15 hours per shift looking after mostly severe Covid-19 patients at a public referral hospital in the capital.At times, she has cared for as many as 30 patients on her own after nurses on her ward quit or got sick.\"Physically it's very tiring,\" she said. \"There's not enough people to cater to all these patients.\"- 'Not worth being a nurse' -But there are plenty of qualified nurses in the Philippines, said Abenojar of Filipino Nurses United.She estimated 200,000 to 250,000 were not working in the sector.Many healthcare workers enter the profession to try to secure better-paid jobs abroad, but the shortage is not due to overseas migration.\"It's because nurses have left the profession,\" said Yasmin Ortiga, assistant professor of sociology at Singapore Management University, pointing to the dearth of stable jobs and dismal wages.A proliferation of nursing programmes led to an oversupply, with many unable to get a permanent position in a local hospital -- necessary to work abroad -- and subsequently a drop in enrolments.Ortiga said: \"People realised that if I am unable to leave the country it's really not worth being a nurse at home.\" - AFP\n",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP): Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen (pic) has boasted of barging uninvited into a video conference call hosted by his political opponents.An enthusiastic user of social media, Hun Sen said that on Friday (Sept 17) he intruded into the Zoom call to warn his opponents that he and his spies were keeping a close eye on them.The Sept 9 call was held by former members of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, which a court dissolved in 2017.Cambodia's courts are widely seen as doing the bidding of Hun Sen's government, in this case eliminating the sole credible opposition party ahead of the 2018 election. The party had been expected to present a strong challenge to Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party, which instead swept the parliamentary polls.Clips of part of Hun Sen's sudden intrusion on the video call have been circulating on social media. They show Hun Sen holding a 12-minute conversation with Long Ry, a former opposition lawmaker.In their chat, Hun Sen complained that members of the former opposition party insulted him personally even though, he claimed, he had tried to promote a \"culture of dialogue.”A spokesman for Hun Sen’s party, Sok Eysan, initially denied that the intrusion and exchange had taken place, saying the video clip was a fabrication.Hun Sen, however, during a live television broadcast Friday opening a COVID-19 vaccination campaign for children, acknowledged the exchange and said he had listened in on about 20 previous calls of his opponents without revealing his presence or showing his face.He also wrote on his Facebook page about his exploit, stressing that he had not been reaching out to negotiate, but to warn them against disruptive activities.U.S. government-funded Radio Free Asia quoted Long Ry as saying that Hun Sen was able to join the Zoom meeting because one of his team members shared the meeting link or password with others so they could listen. He said he would be happy to invite Hun Sen to future meetings to discuss national issues.\"But morally, when people sneak a peak into our affairs, we are not happy,” it quoted Long Ry as saying. \"In politics, I think we should employ honest and straightforward methods, and not take advantages of others by secretly sneaking into their affairs.”Most senior members of the Cambodia National Rescue Party fled into exile after the party was dissolved. Hun Sen has been in power for more than 36 years and said repeatedly he has no intention of stepping down soon. Human rights groups and Western nations accuse his government of suppressing democratic and human rights.Crashing other people's Zoom conferences became a small fad last year when use of the application skyrocketed during the pandemic as many people began working at home. It is usually accomplished by obtaining a password, which is often casually circulated to invitees. - AP\n",

      "(Reuters) - The quartet of newly minted citizen astronauts comprising the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission were due to splash down in the Atlantic off Florida on Saturday, completing a three-day flight of the first all-civilian crew ever launched into Earth orbit.To prepare for atmospheric re-entry and return to Earth, the SpaceX Crew Dragon vehicle completed two rocket \"burns\" on Friday to lower its altitude and line up the capsule's trajectory with the targeted landing site.The Dragon capsule, dubbed Resilience, is scheduled to parachute into the sea around 7 p.m. Eastern time, shortly before sunset, according to SpaceX, the private rocketry company founded by Tesla Inc electric automaker CEO Elon Musk.SpaceX supplied the spacecraft, launched it from Florida and flew it from the company's suburban Los Angeles headquarters.The Inspiration4 team blasted off on Wednesday from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral atop one of SpaceX's two-stage reusable Falcon 9 rockets.Within three hours the crew capsule had reached a cruising orbital altitude of just over 363 miles (585 km) - higher than the International Space Station or Hubble Space Telescope, and the farthest any human has flown from Earth since NASA's Apollo moon program ended in 1972.It also marked the debut flight of Musk's new space tourism business and a leap ahead of competitors likewise offering rides on rocket ships to well-heeled customers willing to pay a small fortune to experience the exhilaration of spaceflight and earn amateur astronaut wings.The Inspiration4 team was led by its wealthy benefactor, Jared Isaacman, chief executive of the e-commerce firm Shift4 Payments Inc, who assumed the role of mission \"commander.\"He had paid an undisclosed but reportedly enormous sum - put by Time magazine at roughly $200 million - to fellow billionaire Musk for all four seats aboard the Crew Dragon.Isaacman was joined by three less affluent crewmates he had selected - geoscientist and former NASA astronaut candidate Sian Proctor, 51, physician's assistant and childhood bone cancer survivor Hayley Arceneaux, 29, and aerospace data engineer and Air Force veteran Chris Sembroski, 42.Isaacman conceived of the flight primarily to raise awareness and donations for one of his favorite causes, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a leading pediatric cancer center in Memphis, Tennessee, where Arceneaux was a patient and now works.The Inspiration4 crew had no part to play in flying the spacecraft, which was operated by ground-based flight teams and onboard guidance systems, even though Isaacman and Proctor are both licensed pilots.SpaceX already ranked as the most well-established player in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures, having launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the space station for NASA.Two rival operators, Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc and Blue Origin, inaugurated their own astro-tourism services in recent months, with their respective founding executives, billionaires Richard Branson and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, each going along for the ride.Those suborbital flights, lasting a matter of minutes, were short hops compared with Inspiration4's three days in orbit.(Writing and additional reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Daniel Wallis)\n",

If they are islands, they can join the 7+7 sandbox extension. If they are areas that have airports, then a system can be set up to conduct Covid-19 tests on new arrivals.• Come up with prevention and control measures in areas that will be opened. Ensure locals are prepared and make enough vaccines available to curb the spread of the virus.• See if the areas to be reopened have enough hospital beds and medics to treat patients should infections spread.The Public Health and Tourism and Sports ministries are expected to discuss details of these measures, after which the Interior and Tourism and Sports Ministries will start reopening the country in two phases:• Phase 1 from October 1: Areas ready to reopen under sandbox schemes.• Phase 2 from October 15 or November 1: Reopening destinations that either have cultural attractions, mountains or seas in the North and the East of the country.Meanwhile, the plan to reopen Bangkok by October 1 has been postponed by two weeks because most residents are waiting for their second jab.So far, 37 per cent of the city’s population has been fully vaccinated, while another 33 per cent are waiting for their second shot.Apart from Bangkok, the reopening of Pattaya, Chiang Mai, Hua hin and Cha-am is also in the pipeline.

      "TWO years ago, video conferencing was a tool used by only a few. Company officials preferred meetings in person even if it meant travelling abroad to seal a deal, or go through lengthy negotiations.Staff meetings were mostly in the office, and face-to-face. Today, almost all of that is conducted online.Despite a partial return to normalcy as we know it, video conferencing does look like it is here to stay. It has proven to be an effective and cheap means of communication.But what the Covid-19 pandemic brought was to force organisations to adapt to changes. It has been a litmus test of resilience. Companies are facing not only changes in the way they conduct day-to-day business but also how they face an economic crisis.Consumer behaviour has changed and so too has the mindset of investors and stakeholders. For some time now, investors have been opting to put their money into companies with strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.A huge amount of money is going into ESG-related funds. According to S&P Global, in 2020, ESG funds in the United States reached US$51bil (RM212.64bil) in assets under management, doubling from 2019 and a 10-fold jump from 2018.It is expected that ESG funds globally would surge to US$53 trillion (RM220.98 trillion) by 2035.“Companies are taking matters surrounding ESG and digitalisation more seriously based on the recognition of the risk of fading into oblivion if they fail to be forward-looking in their approach,” says KPMG Malaysia head of sustainability Kasturi Nathan.She points out that economic disruptions during the ongoing pandemic have brought to light the urgency towards more sustainable consumption and production life cycles.“We’ve seen how companies are pushed to the limits of operational viability when they continue to utilise scarce and non-renewable resources, prioritise sales of new products, and fail to collaborate, innovate or adapt.“In contrast, a company with a sustainable or circular economy mindset will be well insulated from value chain disruptions because it will have engineered a way to extract limitless value from its resources,” Kasturi adds.Berjaya Corp Bhd (BCorp) CEO Abdul Jalil Abdul Rasheed says ESG adoption by corporations like Berjaya is a natural progression.“Sustainable investing is no longer a fringe subject and is very much here to stay. It is critical not just because of the obvious ‘green’ issues but because strong performances across the pillars of ESG suggest that a business commands some level of resilience,” he tells StarBizWeek.While the ESG concept is not new, it is brought into focus after large Malaysian corporations such as Top Glove Corp Bhd, FGV Holdings Bhd and Sime Darby Plantations Bhd were alleged to have questionable labour practices.It took more than a year for Top Glove to resume selling its glove products to the US after it was banned by the US Customs and Border Protection last July.Another palpable change taking place in corporate Malaysia is the efforts being taken by giants such as national oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd and utility provider Tenaga Nasional Bhd to lead the way by announcing their commitment to have net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.Technology turbo-chargedJalil of BCorp notes that the prerequisite for post-pandemic success is agility, namely the ability to pivot and make business decisions quickly, a process that traditionally took longer.And that the adoption of technology is no longer a competitive advantage but an “absolute necessity.”“Covid-19 has presented itself as an opportunity for the Berjaya Group to identify our core strengths while putting a spotlight on areas of distress.“One of our first objectives is to streamline the business so as to create clarity, synergy and greater transparency,” he says.In the next two years, he reckons that BCrop will be focusing on mining the value of its assets that will eventually turn it into a strong and agile investment holding company.BCorp is a diversified conglomerate, with 109 subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures.Under its new strategic plan, BCorp plans asset divestments worth RM2bil over two years and RM5bil over five years and a reduction of its debt level from RM5bil to RM2.5bil over three years. It is also implementing a dividend policy for all operating companies.Forecasting mega trendsErnst & Young PLT Malaysia turnaround and restructuring strategy leader Datuk Stephen Duar says many corporations were “woefully underprepared” when the pandemic emerged.This was despite the fact that “infectious diseases” was cited as one of the top 10 global risks in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Risks Report 2020.“As we have witnessed during the pandemic, most corporates and businesses have limitations in forecasting mega trends, which are trends and forces outside their usual scope of analysis, and understanding what the drivers are for long-term risk and opportunity,” he says.Duar says the pandemic has revealed inherent weaknesses in many business models.He says digital and technological disruptions have already been underway in recent years but the pandemic has intensified its pace.“For example, the prolonged movement control order (MCO) has forced many corporations to rethink their business delivery model in response to shifts in consumer purchasing behaviour.”He adds that the pandemic, coupled with recent “climate disasters”, has exacerbated social challenges such as rising inequality, growing human rights abuses in supply chains and collapsing social safety nets, especially in developing countries.“For example, calls for action against labour abuses, such as insufficient health and safety measures and wage cuts amid the Covid-19 pandemic, has resulted in companies having to issue public statements on their practices and making commitments on better employment practices.“As more issues are being mainstreamed and openly discussed, more companies are beginning to understand that considering ESG risks and opportunities is not just good business but an imperative strategy to maintain the social licence to operate, regardless of sector or industry,” Duar says.This week, British American Tobacco (M) Bhd laid out its sustainable strategy dubbed “A Better Tomorrow” with the aim of reducing risks associated with smoking cigarettes as part of its new strategy focusing on sustainability.“We will work to reduce the health impact of our business and at the same time champion environmental, social and governance excellence.“We believe this will drive the company’s long-term business sustainability and create shared value for consumers, society, employees and our shareholders,” BAT Malaysia legal and external affairs head Nicholas Booth said at a press conference on Tuesday.The tobacco company also said it will be benchmarking itself against the FTSE4Good Bursa Malaysia ESG rating.The FTSE4Good index is used to measure companies that meet ESG compliance set by FTSE Russel. Right now, there are only 76 companies listed in the index out of 933 listed companies on Bursa Malaysia.Facing a difficult situationSome companies are also facing declining earnings and tight cashflow due to the pandemic, which are driving them to restructure.Take the case of Boustead Holdings Bhd. While the company has announced its digitalisation plan, it is also in the race to sell its assets and non-core businesses to improve its depleting cash and pare down its huge debt that stands at RM7.5bil.Boustead, however, has not elaborated on its digitisation efforts, which has drawn some criticism from the market as the group is very much a brick-and-mortar company trying to shake off some legacy issues.The aviation industry has also been hit. Driven by the bleak outlook, AirAsia has been quick to enhance digitalisation, pivoting into e-commerce, ride-hailing, food delivery and growing its logistics arm Teleport.AirAsia is also raising funds to keep its airlines business afloat.Since the pandemic, the company has gone through almost various means to raise funds including private placements, rights issues and government-guaranteed loans.AirAsia’s digitalisation efforts started in 2016 and are starting to pay off. AirAsia expects its non-airline revenues to contribute up to half of group revenue in the next three to five years, and gradually overtake the airline revenue.The group is now working on creating what it calls an Asean super app, which aims to offer all its services on one platform.Deloitte Malaysia CEO Yee Wing Peng notes that there could be a significant cut in air travel post-pandemic as more companies embrace technology and digitalisation.“As an international firm with global offices worldwide, Deloitte also recognises the impact of our carbon footprint. In April 2021, we launched the Deloitte WorldClimate initiative, where we pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, and one of the key initiatives is to cut air travel,” he says.He expects more “distress-related” mergers and acquisitions to take place in the hospitality, aviation, retail, wholesale and automotive sectors.He reckons that companies now have changed their strategies, moving from “acquiring for growth” to “acquiring to transform”, with technology being the main focus.“Companies that take advantage of this can implement new business and operating models for a combined or separate entity, and drive significant revenue growth and sustainable margin improvement,” he says.According to PwC Malaysia deals leader Victor Saw, at the onset of the pandemic, many companies in Malaysia adopted the “wait-and-see” approach believing that they had sufficient cash reserves to sustain themselves through the pandemic.“Clearly, many thought the pandemic would only last for a few months. The continuous lockdowns, however, have put a significant strain on their cash reserves and as the economy begins to open up, the demand for working capital has never been more critical.“We are seeing a greater number of companies wanting to divest their non-core assets in order to shore up liquidity and allocate their resources towards their core business as government assistance and moratoriums come to an end,” he says.Based on PwC Malaysia’s 2021 “Act Now To Recover” survey on business recovery among Malaysian business leaders and owners, he says about 65% of respondents have used a rapid cost-reduction programme to help relieve operational and liquidity pressures.In the short term, he believes that corporations may want to place greater scrutiny on their cash and working capital requirements to be more agile.“The journey to recovery is certainly challenging yet it also presents an opportunity for businesses to reinvent themselves to continue to stay relevant to the market’s needs.“This may mean that corporations need to continuously reassess their business model amid significant disruption caused by the pandemic to not only stay afloat but to survive and thrive,” Saw says.\n",

      "WITH the acceleration of the nationwide vaccination programme and reopening of more economic and social sectors, a pick-up in property transactions in the near term looks promising.And with the Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) also coming to a tentative end on Dec 31, industry observers and property consultants are optimistic that buyers will be scouting for new homes.Savills Malaysia Sdn Bhd group managing director Datuk Paul Khong says he expects many prospective buyers to capitalise on the discounts and rebates offered under the HOC, before time runs out.“This year has been a challenging year with more than three months of full lockdown and as we head towards the end of 2021, many buyers may still decide to pick up a new property to enjoy the final discount packages from developers and incentives under the HOC.“We do not expect a big surge in property purchases for the remainder of 2021 but may see some last-minute buyers who have been waiting out since the start of the year,” he tells StarBizWeek.Knight Frank deputy managing director Keith Ooi says while the housing market is on a recovery path, prices, however, are anticipated to remain flat.“Although there was an improvement in transactional activity in the first quarter of this year, the average house price for Kuala Lumpur, a buyer’s market, was lower by 3.1% year-on-year.“This is likely attributed to weaker demand amid rising inventory as potential buyers and investors adopt the wait-and-see approach during this trying time.”In contrast, he says, average house prices for Penang remained resilient with 0.2% growth, supported by initiatives under the various stimulus packages and the HOC.“Moving forward, with domestic investors shifting from the stock market to safer and less volatile alternative investment products, supported by the record-low interest rate environment, lockdown savings and attractive property deals, the overall housing market is expected to gradually recover throughout 2022.“But prices in general are expected to remain flattish.”Going forward, Ooi says the overall value in the residential sub-sector in Malaysia is likely to remain soft throughout 2021.“Pricing for prime housing, particularly landed properties, are expected to gradually rise throughout 2022, as the property market is widely expected to start recovering on the back of a more positive outlook,” he says.According to Knight Frank’s latest Global Buyer Survey, the line between primary and secondary residences has become distorted during the lockdown.“With children being home educated and parents working remotely, some home owners have spent a longer amount of time at home.”Khong says the ongoing HOC will continue to spur demand for primary homes.“We see good discounts offered on many new projects and the entry costs are much lower for buyers.“This is a good time to shop for properties. The secondary market has also taken a hit due to the pandemic. As such, asking prices have become attractive and this segment of the market is expected to stay competitive.”Khong adds that the medium, high-rise segment will continue to perform in 2022, as these are considered safe products catered for the mass market.“Demand in this segment is expected to stay relatively strong, especially for those projects located in well-established neighbourhoods with good accessibility, especially via public transportation.“The landed terrace house segment will also be another sector to watch. We expect to see some good launches from the township developers on their landed housing projects into the last quarter.”UOB Kay Hian in a recent report says it expects resilient underlying demand for landed properties from home occupiers and upgraders when the pent-up demand kicks in, as was evidenced in the first quarter of this year.“We prefer developers that focus on township development, matured areas and landed properties at this point.“We foresee pent-up demand towards the fourth quarter of 2021, given the projected herd immunity by year-end, low interest-rate environment and the ongoing HOC.”The HOC was initially kicked off in January 2019 to address the overhang problem in the country. The campaign, which was initially intended for six months, was extended for a full year.It proved successful, having generated sales totalling RM23.2bil in 2019, surpassing the government’s initial target of RM17bil.The government reintroduced the HOC in June last year under the Penjana initiative to boost the property market after it was adversely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.The campaign has been extended to the end of this year, with property consultants and developers fully supporting the move.In March this year, during the Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association’s briefing on the property market for 2021, its president Datuk Soam Heng Choon revealed that since the HOC was reintroduced last June, a total of 34,354 residential units valued at RM25.65bil had been sold as at Feb 28, 2021.Additionally, UOB Kay Hian says long-term fundamentals remain unexciting.“The market’s long-term growth prospects could continue to be clouded by structural issues such as unresolved supply glut and deteriorating affordability.”The research house adds that the revised Malaysia My Second Home programme, with stricter terms to foreign buyers, could cast a shadow over the already subdued economy and the housing market over time.“Yet, we expect marginal impact on the developers in the near term as foreign buyers account for less than 5% of their property sales.“We understand the new housing minister is re-examining the new criteria imposed and we are hopeful for a positive outcome,” UOB Kay Hian says.Meanwhile, the National Property Information Centre (Napic), says the acceleration of the nationwide vaccination drive and National Recovery Plan threshold across the states will see the reopening of more economic and social sectors in the fourth quarter of 2021.“Supported by the implementation of various government initiatives and assistance, the property market is expected to be on the recovery path, in line with the gradual economic recovery,” it says in a statement.According to Napic data for the first half of 2021, there were 92,017 transactions worth RM34.51bil recorded during the period.This represented a year-on-year increase of 22.2% in volume and 34.7% in value.“Performance across the states improved in the review period. All states recorded higher market volume except for Putrajaya. The four major states, namely Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Johor and Penang, formed about 50% of the total national residential volume.”In the primary market, Napic says there were 16,660 units launched, down by 34% against 25,227 units in the first half of 2020.“Against the second half of 2020, the new launches were lower by 24.1%.”Sales performance in the first half of 2021 stood at 24.7%, surpassing the 12.9% recorded in the previous corresponding period.“The improvement in sales performance can be attributed to the various measures by the government such as incentives under the HOC and low interest rate.”By property type, Napic says terraced houses dominated new launches in the first half of this year.“Single-storey (2,624 units) and two and three-storey (5,455) units together contributed 48.5% of the total units, followed by condominium/apartment units at 41.4% share (6,893 units).”Meanwhile, the residential overhang level exhibited a moderated growth, Napic says.“A total of 31,112 overhang units worth RM20.09bil was recorded, showing an increase of 5.2% and 6.2% in volume and value, respectively, against the preceding half.”\n",

      "THERE is a common joke in China’s real estate fraternity. When the real estate market is bad, buyers will complain about everything during the property handover. But during a bull market, if you handover a unit without a front door, they would still gladly take possession.That is the nature of the real estate industry. It is one of the most important sectors in the economy in most parts of the world, not only from an economic standpoint but also from a societal angle.Housing for the masses has always been a thorny issue that governments of the day are required to address.A good government is one that is deemed to have a policy which balances the people’s housing needs versus the vibrancy of the real estate market. This is because real estate functions not only as an asset class but it also serves a greater humanitarian need, a roof over one’s head.Traditionally, developing economies around the world have higher gross domestic product (GDP) growth percentage in comparison to developed nations as real estate and construction forms a huge weightage in its contribution towards the GDP of a country.The real estate sector creates far reaching spillover effects where a boom in this single industry results in growth for other sectors along the value chain such as building materials, steel, furniture, logistics and countless others.However, as a country’s economy transits from developing to developed, one would notice a gradual slowdown in the pace of its real estate projects.Indeed, real estate, infrastructure and construction is the most direct way in which fiscal stimulus can inject life into the economy but it is never the most sustainable.This is primarily because it is a debt driven sector where developers, contractors and end consumers rely on loans to fuel its demand. Hence, debts will pile up substantially over time, especially if unregulated.This brings me to the most pressing issue in the real estate world today; China’s Evergrande Group’s (Evergrande) potential collapse. Evergrande is the second largest real estate developer in China by sales revenue. Another interesting “title” it helms would be the world’s most indebted company.Evergrande has liabilities amounting to an estimated US$300bil (RM1.26 trillion) from years of aggressive expansion.To put it into perspective, Malaysia’s total debt as of December 2020 stood at RM1.26 trillion. Imagine a company’s liabilities is equivalent to our nation. Now what if it defaults on its debt obligations and goes under? Until today, China has yet to go through any major recession unlike other economies around the world. Many market commentators are increasingly worried that the potential default by Evergrande would pose a systemic risk to the economy of China.Some are even saying that Evergrande may potentially be China’s version of Lehman Brothers. Although I do not think so, there are flashing red signals.At present, Evergrande has 10 active offshore bonds issued on the market. To get a gauge on its precarious state, the company’s bond with the soonest maturity on March 23, 2022 has fallen a whopping 70% to 30 US cents as of Sept 14, 2021.For the bond furthest from maturity on June 28 2025, it has fallen 67% to 27.46 US cents. This essentially means the bond market is pricing a default. The table shows five of the largest Evergrande bond issuance in size and its performance.When the 2019-2020 Hong Kong protest (also known as Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement) erupted, many with the government of the day blamed the Hong Kong youths as unpatriotic, unappreciative and hateful.While not highlighted sufficiently, there were actually underlying economic factors which spurred the protest.The key one being exorbitant housing prices which made it out of reach for many youths. Unlike Singapore, the affordable housing schemes in Hong Kong is far from comprehensive due to the expensive land cost which is part of a key revenue stream for the Hong Kong government.During the protest around September, 2019, I was in Hong Kong for a business meeting. I remembered my friend’s 630 sq ft private condominium unit in Sai Kung (which is near the port and surrounded by fishing villages), cost HK$11mil (RM5.9mil).That is equivalent to an unfathomable RM9,400 per sq ft. In my view, most youths would never be able to own a home at such pricing.Real estate is often described as old economy and many of the older generation built their wealth from real estate during the booming economic years.In fact, many of the “old money” of the world today have some ties to real estate one way or another. After all, it is an asset class that hedges well against inflation and preserves the value of wealth or money rather effectively.Yet, whether real estate should be economic driver of a country is debatable.Whenever I assess the real estate market, a respectable figure that comes to my mind would be Tan Sri Chew Chee Kin, the long time president of Sunway Group and trusted general of Tan Sri Jeffrey Cheah.Back in 2015, I was a group strategy manager with the organisation and had the opportunity to sit in some of the leadership meetings.I remembered his wise words to the senior management at the time. He said “the golden age of real estate may likely come to an end with the supply flooding the market, the company needs to take note of this. Unless one can find a way to build houses like how Toyota build their cars, otherwise it is hard to maintain a dominant position in a fragmented market.Although we are witnessing real estate companies venturing globally to foreign markets, at the end of the day, real estate is still a localised industry. It is important to remember why HSBC did well and it has to do with its motto; “The World’s Local Bank.”Years later, I met Chew again during a friendly corporate delegation visit. At the time, several of the largest real estate developers in China were venturing into Malaysia in a big way.I will never forget what Chew said in eloquent Mandarin as an ice-breaker during the visit, “Sharks may rule the ocean, but not freshwater river. That said, I look forward to learning from you.”The pandemic exposed the structural flaws in many emerging markets economy and in a way, brought about a great reset for industries, companies and people.I personally learn to appreciate the conventional wisdom of the business leaders before my time and the older generations like my father.Sunway Group has proven to be a resilient organisation which has a core group of industry titans sitting right at the top.They are guided by the success and mistakes of the past, especially the two economic crisis in 1986 and 1997/98 that nearly brought the group down. As they pivot along the industries (property to healthcare) within the conglomerate prudently, it showed bigger is not necessarily better.There is no more fitting illustration of the importance of prudence and fiscal responsibility than the Evergrande episode. Whether Evergrande remains ever grand is a side story. Nonetheless, it should be a lesson to all companies especially those within the property sector.

      "KUALA LUMPUR: Despite a drop in Top Glove Corp Bhd’s net profit in the fourth quarter ended Aug 31 (Q4’21), the world’s largest glove maker is confident that the demand for gloves will continue to be strong on the return of its customer orders from Africa, Middle East, Vietnam, Thailand, China and the United States.Its managing director Datuk Lee Kim Meow said its customers’ orders from these countries are returning as average selling prices (ASPs) of gloves are currently trending lower.“These are some of the positive signs. Countries that were not active in purchasing gloves from last year and up till early this year are now coming back because it is affordable to buy gloves. They will continue to play their part to take-up the gloves,” he said during the the media and analyst briefing on its Q4’21 results.As such, Lee is enthused that the demand for gloves would continue to surge amid heightened concerns of new Covid-19 variants.In Q4’21, Top Glove saw a pick-up in sales volume in Africa and Middle East of 15% and 38% respectively, compared to the Q3’21.For the full financial year ended Aug 31, 2021 (FY’21), the glovemaker saw a rise in sales volume from Latin America, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Asia excluding Japan of 17%, 8%, 15% and 12% respectively compared to a year ago.Following the lifting of the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) ban, Lee said Top Glove is expected to see a boost in sales volume in the coming quarters with the resumption of sales to the US market.It is important to note that its sales to the US accounted for 15% of the group’s total sales in FY’21.He pointed out that exports to the US is expected to be fully normalised by December and shipments would resume as early as end of this month.“We are back in business and have goods that are ready. We are confident that we will retain our customers in the US and also attract new customers.“Our customers know that we have the capacity and capability. They know one of the ways to grow bigger in their industry is to have a strong supplier like Top Glove,” Lee said.Top Glove’s disposable gloves are now admissible at all US ports of entry effective Sept 10.After getting the nod to resume selling its glove products to the US, AmInvestment Bank Research, in its report said Top Glove could see a boost in its earnings.“This is a positive development as it indicates that environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns have been alleviated,” it said.The glove maker posted a historic net profit of RM7.87bil for the FY’21 from RM1.75bil a year ago.However, its Q4’21 earnings fell to RM607.94mil compared to RM1.17bil a year ago amid the very challenging operating environment.The group’s revenue fell 32% to RM2.12bil in the quarter from RM3.11bil a year ago.As at Aug 31, Top Glove’s net cash position remained healthy at RM2.05bil.The group declared a total dividend of 65.1 sen per share, amounting to RM5.21bil for FY’21 which represents a 452% increase from the full year dividend 11.8 sen per share in FY’20.Besides that, Top Glove said it would renew its listing application to push ahead with its plans to raise US$1bil (RM4.17bil) in Hong Kong.The group has been seeking a dual primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since last year, but the deal was put on hold following the import ban from US authorities.\n",

It continues to show us the cracks in our businesses, particularly from an ESG perspective, while highlighting the importance of resilience and adaptability.Investor appetite and expectations have certainly shifted with accelerated demand for the adoption of ESG best practices as investors are increasingly integrating these factors into their decision-making processes.This could be considered a silver lining due to the Covid-19 pandemic, given that ESG will drive greater improvements for society as a whole and for corporations in their engagements with the communities in which they operate.A few salient benefits that corporations will need to move faster on would be reversing the degradation of the environment, improving social compliance and most certainly conducting business with more principles and governance.According to the International Institute of Sustainable Development, in 2018, global sustainable investments amounted to about US$30 trillion (RM125 trillion). By 2036, that number is expected to reach over US$150 trillion (RM625 trillion) signifying a 433% increase.MSCI data confirms that companies with high ESG performance relative to their sector peers have done well and have continued to attract capital even during the pandemic. Bursa Malaysia announced earlier this year that companies with better ESG practices were more resilient during the pandemic.How does ESG criteria impact investment decisions and portfolio construction at KWAP?At KWAP, ESG is a given and it is embedded in our DNA when it comes to investing. Eventually, we foresee a fully ESG-compliant portfolio. Hence, we had asked for improved compliance with ESG practices from our portfolio of companies.It is not just about the bottom line performance, it is about how businesses operate.Climate change, debt bondage and corporate fraud are just a few of the negative outcomes in relation to poor ESG practices. Companies must raise the bar on how they conduct their businesses.As a major investor with a portfolio of RM150bil in assets under management, KWAP must take the lead to ensure that the ESG journey is accelerated in the country. To do this, we are focused on active shareholder engagement.We look into sustainability, impact on the environment, workers’ rights, employee living conditions, adherence to international labour standards and much more. We are mindful that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to ESG compliance.For example, some of our neighbouring nations do not need to depend on foreign labour while we do to a certain extent. Dependency on foreign labour exposes these companies to the risk of unsavoury practices by foreign agents.As part of our engagement with our portfolio companies, we also emphasise the need for them to ensure good ESG practices across their supply chain, be it their suppliers or outsourcing partners.ESG is a journey and we will continue to see evolving expectations and new benchmarks set. What might have been acceptable ESG practices in 2020 might not be so now and what is acceptable right now may not be next year.What strategy should corporations impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic be thinking about as they restructure to stay afloat?A key consideration should be future-proofing their business. We are living through the devastating impact of the pandemic and it is not difficult to imagine how much more severe the impact of climate change will be on society and the global economy. Businesses that are not future proof will not be viewed favourably.Automation and digitalisation will have to be accelerated and this needs to be accompanied by specific improvements to efficiencies. This applies to any sector and any nature of business.It would be imprudent to presume that such key areas of change need not be pursued on the premise that the pandemic will fade away.Asset owners expect investee companies to address their financial risk, reputational risks as well as threats and opportunities.The Covid-19 pandemic will very likely be considered an endemic and this will come with its fair share of challenges.Hence, companies and sectors must strengthen processes and indeed have a mindset change on how they prepare to manage their businesses future-forward.What opportunities have become apparent in this crisis?Covid-19 also provides new opportunities. Clearly, new growth areas are opening up as a result of this pandemic such as renewable energy, low-carbon technologies, water, health, ageing population and sustainable agriculture.One of the areas we are also looking at is how businesses need to pivot in terms of strengthening their network in the value chain particularly if they are export-driven.As we have seen recently, there has been a pragmatic move by major global manufacturers to move their manufacturing hubs away from traditionally preferred geographical locations in order to be less dependent on one particular geographic area to support their supply needs.This provides opportunities for entrepreneurs. As a long-term investor, KWAP sees this upside potential especially for Malaysia to benefit from such adjustment.Has Covid-19 sharpened investors’ focus on sustainability, ESG factors and digitalisation?Our ESG journey started as early as 2009 and it was triggered by our focus that investing in companies with good ESG practices can contribute towards delivering sustainable risk-adjusted returns and therefore enhance shareholder’s value in the long run.This remains true, even in the post-Covid-19 world.In terms of digitalisation, for the last few years, we have been encouraging our investee companies to adopt digital solutions. Unfortunately, the take-up rate has not been quick enough.However, the pandemic has played a part in fast-tracking the adoption of digitalisation, arguably due to necessity as companies clamber to adjust to the new norm in order to continue their operations and remain competitive.As highlighted earlier, companies have no choice but to strengthen their infrastructure in terms of digitalisation and this must be executed in tandem with cultural changes for companies, given that staff will need to be engaged in a more conscious and considerate manner to ensure that staff are better prepared for this new age of conducting business.Will this focus on sustainability last?If there are any lessons that we need to take from this pandemic it is that we can never revert to the previous status quo.The focus on sustainability will only gain momentum.We will see more regulatory demands as governments strive to meet their sustainability goals including climate change-related goals, we also expect demands from consumers to increase and of course, investors will continue to focus on ESG compliance.Based on Bloomberg data released in July 2021, ESG assets are on track to exceed US$50 trillion (RM208.57 trillion) globally by 2025 compared to US$35 trillion (RM146 trillion) in 2020, US$30.6 trillion (RM127.65 trillion) in 2018 and US$22.8 trillion (RM95.11 trillion) in 2016.There is also an increasing number of asset owners and asset managers who have integrated ESG into their investment decision making by becoming to the United Nations Backed Principles of Responsible Investment (PRI).KWAP became a signatory to the UN-backed PRI in 2018.As of July 1, 2021, PRI assets under management stood at US$121.2 trillion (RM505.59 trillion) based on 3,404 investor signatories, representing an increase of US$17.9 trillion (RM74.67 trillion) from US$103.4 trillion (RM431.33 trillion) at the end of March 2020 (17% increase).This long-term formal commitment is a strong indication that sustainability is here to stay.The pandemic was a turning point for corporations locally and globally. We need to ensure that we do not regress to the past.KWAP is focused that there is a permanent shift to incorporate sustainability into our organisation’s DNA and become part of our culture.\n",

      "WHILE banking stocks have so far acted negatively to the Finance Ministry’s (MoF) instruction to get banks working on exempting interest payments for moratorium borrowers, observers say it is too early to predict the exact impact on banks.“We await the announced outcome and allow banks to distil the impact and/or provide some pushback,” CLSA banking analyst Peter Kong tells clients in a report.Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) analyst Chan Jit Hoong says he is making no change to his earnings forecasts for banks at the moment “till we gather more updates from banks.”It is understood that the banks themselves are awaiting more instructions from Bank Negara on the matter.On Tuesday, the MoF said in a statement that it had instructed banking institutions to quickly work on exemption of interest rate payments for recipients under the country’s moratorium programme.This will involve borrowers from the bottom 50% of all Malaysians as measured by income, for the October to December 2021 period.The moratorium – a temporary halt of loan payments by bank borrowers – is in place as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic which has caused many, especially from the lower-income groups, to not be able to service their regular loans because of factors like job losses and closure of businesses.While borrowers do not have to make payments on their loans under a moratorium period, the downside of it is that interest tends to accrue as a result of taking up the moratorium, and the borrower will have to bear this interest.“While we do not downplay the plight of those suffering, we believe interest waivers need to be selective, and see banks pushing back if this were not the case,” says CLSA’s Kong.“Details are scant, but modification losses may arise in this current form and we cannot rule out a potential knee-jerk reaction,” he adds.Banks have declined to comment on the matter at the moment.However, some have chosen to highlight the measures that they have been implementing in the current times.CIMB Group Holdings Bhd CEO Datuk Abdul Rahman Ahmad (pic) says the bank remains cautious in the second half of 2021, as it anticipates the global Covid-19 resurgence to bring about challenges such as stagnant loan growth, low interest rates, margin compression and modification losses.“We will continue to focus on helping our customers navigate the economic challenges caused by the pandemic,” he tells StarBizWeek.According to him, CIMB has offered various payment assistance programmes in three phases from 2020, and to date, it has helped around 480,000 customers through its opt-in programmes and about 1.2 million customers via the blanket moratorium offered in March 2020.“We recognise that providing repayment assistance in a fast-tracked and convenient manner is key.“We invested heavily on digitising this area in order to provide assistance in a seamless and digital manner.“And whilst I am aware there are still shortcomings and criticisms on banks, given the constraints of our working environment due to the mobility restrictions, I am pleased to say that CIMB took the lead in providing repayment assistance with our straight through digital processing platform, with a virtual 100% approval rate.”Abdul Rahman says beyond the repayment assistance, CIMB continues to provide support to communities in need and also to the national healthcare system.“In Malaysia, we recently announced our RM10mil aid commitment under our Komuniti Kita Covid-19 Relief project towards upgrading hospitals and medical facilities and food aid programmes in partnership with several NGOs,” he adds.CIMB is expecting provision for doubtful debts to remain elevated amid the ongoing pandemic.AMMB Holdings Bhd (AmBank) group CEO Datuk Sulaiman Mohd Tahir is expecting the same, taking a prudent stand on provisions.“We have taken an additional RM87mil of overlay in the first quarter of financial year ending March 31, 2022 (FY22), which is necessary at this juncture, with total overlay carried forward standing at RM833mil now,” he tells StarBizWeek.“Nevertheless, we are actually experiencing a reduction in impaired loans, (FY21 1.54%; FY20 1.73%) which again is a function of how we have managed the moratorium for our clientele.“Frankly, if not for the current moratorium, we would have seen a lot more non-performing loans.“The current structure also provides for those who are servicing their loans currently with the freedom and prospect of not backloading their loan payments,” says Sulaiman.He declined to comment on the recent instruction by the MoF.Meanwhile, in his report, HLIB’s Chan notes that MoF’s instruction to exempt three months of interest payments for the B50 segment under the loan moratorium is a negative development but unlikely to have material impact on banks.“However, forecasts are unchanged till we gather more updates from banks. In any case, we have rolled our valuations to FY22 and this is a one-off event. We reckon price weakness is an opportunity to accumulate.”According to Chan, the banking sector’s risk-reward profile continues to “skew to the upside” as Covid-19 woes will likely fizzle out in 2022 while the state of the economy and banking sector will “only get better” in time.“Furthermore, valuations are undemanding and there is ample liquidity in the market.”For large-sized banks, he likes Malayan Banking Bhd for its strong yield, and Public Bank Bhd for its resilient asset quality over CIMB.\n",

      "SIX months ago, in a column entitled “Early signs of weakness in commercial real estate” dated March 6, a review was carried out among listed Malaysian Real Estate Investment Trusts (M-REITs) in terms of the market value of their properties, and to see the impact of the pandemic on the valuation of their properties.In summary, based on the reported data by M-REITS with the financial year-end of December 2020, there are early signs of weakness among commercial properties, but not necessarily across the board.Even within the office, retail, or hospitality segment, M-REITs seem to be resilient enough to withstand the economic headwinds.A quick check with M-REITs that had financial year-end outside the December period saw some material movements, but these assets were mainly confined to retail and hospitality REITs.Among them was a RM19.1mil or 5.1% drop in The Summit Subang, USJ’s market value, owned by AmFIRST REIT, which stood at RM357.4mil against the carrying value of RM376.5mil.Other notable changes were seen in YTL Hospitality REIT’s (YTL REIT) assets, in particular their Australian and Japanese properties.According to YTL REIT, these assets saw an increase of RM132.3mil and RM30mil in the market value of the properties, representing an increase of 7.2% and 6% respectively. Even YTL REIT’s Malaysian hotel assets saw an improvement in value with a modest increase of RM24mil or 1.1%.Hence, despite the lockdowns and economic challenges faced by M-REITs, we have only seen isolated cases where the value of commercial properties has declined and to the contrary, for YTL REITs, the value of its assets, even for those that are located in Malaysia, rose.M-REITs welcomes IGB Commercial REITTo be listed on Monday, IGB Commercial REIT (IGBCR) is coming to the market at a time when the real estate market is facing tough times.Recent reports have suggested that the office sub-sector is facing some form of glut, not only driven by the pandemic and business closures or scale down of operations, especially with the culture of working from home, but also due to the sheer size of the incoming office supply.In fact, the recently released data from the National Property Information Centre (Napic) for the the first half of 2021 showed occupancy rate of purpose-built office (private) in Kuala Lumpur fell to 72.2%, down 3.6 percentage points from the first half of 2020 rate of 75.8%.Data also showed that some 70 office buildings within Kuala Lumpur or approximately 17.1% of all buildings have a vacancy rate in excess of 50%.A year ago, this figure was 63 buildings or 15.7% of the total number of buildings. For the record, Kuala Lumpur alone has some 2.54 million square meters of available space and that represents 50.1% of Malaysia’s total vacancy of 5.07 million square meters as at end of the first half of 2021. Although no shares were offered to the public, the initial public offering (IPO) involved a restricted offer for sale (ROFS) to IGB shareholders on the basis of two IGBCR for every five IGB shares held at an offer price of RM1 per unit and a distribution-in-specie of three IGBCR for every two ROFS subscribed.In effect, the shareholders of IGB have subscribed to IGBCR units at an effective price of RM0.40 per unit for the five IGBCR that they obtained via the ROFS and the distribution-in-specie.The ROFS was undersubscribed by 21.3% or some 163.5 million units. Together with the original allocated institutional tranche of 130mil units, the unsubscribed ROFS of 163.5mil units too were also sold to institutions at a final fixed price of RM0.71 per unit. Hence, based on the final numbers, the institutional tranche is approximately 12.7% of the total 2,307.3mil units to be listed on Monday while subscribers of the ROFS will hold approximately 26.3% of the total issued units, which comprise of related, non-related, and minority shareholders.The shareholders who have subscribed to the ROFS are now sitting on some paper losses due to a drop in the share price of IGB shares itself. Based on IGB’s last Wednesday’s closing market price of RM1.92 and the cum-price of RM2.84, an IGB shareholder holding five shares of the company before the ex-date for the entitlement to the ROFS has suffered a loss of RM0.92 per IGB share. As in theory, they have a gain of RM0.31 per IGBCR (the difference between the effective cost of 40 sen per unit against the reference price of 71 sen), IGB shareholders are sitting on a paper loss of 61 sen per IGB share held before the ex-date.IGBCR will be the 18th M-REITs to be listed on the market but in terms of size, with a market capitalisation of RM1.64bil, based on the institutional offer price of 71 sen, it will be the sixth largest among all the M-REITs. However, in terms of exposure to the office sub-sector, IGBCR will emerge as the largest office REIT with a market value that is almost equivalent to UOA Reits and Sentral REITs combined. As a percentage of the Bursa Malaysia REIT index, IGBCR will emerge with a 4.21% weighting on the index.IGBCR comprises 10 highly valuable office buildings which were injected into the REITs at a combined value of RM3.16bil. This was satisfied via the issuance of the current units in circulation, which is 2,307.5mil units at an issue price of RM1 per share and cash of RM853.2mil to the vendors. The cash portion is funded via borrowings whereby IGBCR has raised RM850mil via a medium term note programme. In essence, the market value of the company of RM1.64bil is 51.8% of the value of the ten assets combined valuation and a 29% discount to the net asset value (NAV) of the company.The lukewarm response to IGBCR’s IPO, especially via the ROFS perhaps is a reflection of the soft market conditions. In fact, IGBCR too revealed that its current occupancy rate is at about 76.3%. When compared with its nearest rivals, Sentral REITs and UOA REITs have a much better occupancy rate of 93% and 88% respectively as at end of 2020.In terms of prospects, IGBCR did provide some guidance for this year, with an estimated distribution per unit of 3.9 sen per share. This translates to a yield of 5.5% based on the reference price of RM0.71 per share. As can be seen from the table, when compared with UOA REITs and Sentral REITs, IGBCR looks to be attractively priced on a P/NAV basis but not on a dividend yield basis as both the former have a weighted average yield that is at least 2.5 percentage points higher than IGBCR. This could be a reflection of a lower occupancy rate at IGBCR’s properties.Valuation matrix of office REITs and IGB REITsAs IGB has gained a reputable name in the management of its assets, judging by the premium IGB REITs itself commands, which at 1.58x P/NAV and just 4.1% in terms of yield, it may not come as a surprise that IGBCR too may attract investors interest due to its premium market position and value that it brings to investors. While IGBCR has an inferior dividend yield but comparable P/NAV with other office-based REITs, it commands a much higher dividend yield and lower P/NAV when measured against its sister company, IGB REITs.Pankaj C Kumar is a long-time investment analyst.

      "ON the eve of Malaysia Day, I was delighted to share a few drinks and cigars with my two elderly sifus, Peter Khoo and TK Teo. Khoo, an accounting and tax practitioner and Teo, an experienced banker and corporate personality, have such great stories to tell with much wisdom imparted from their past experiences.But our discussion turned sombre when I asked them how bad has this pandemic-driven recession affected Malaysian SMEs, as compared with other recessions since 1987.Both say that the SMEs are facing the toughest challenges ever seen before.Khoo reckons some 30% of Malaysian SMEs have closed down in the last 18 months. Teo feels that more SMEs will close down come January 2022 when the bank moratorium ends.My hairstylist who used to have a saloon in Kota Damansara told me that more than half of the 40 over hair salons in his area have closed down in the last 18 months. Many shopping malls across the country have seen retail and F&B stores close. Not forgetting the closures of so many hotels and all tourism businesses. The list is endless. The damage is extensive.The many lockdowns and strict SOPs have ruined many businesses. As the losses mounted, cash flow depleted super fast, defaults on bank loans reprieved by two moratoriums, savings are all used up and there is no light at the end of the tunnel for any recovery in business. Until now.Luckily for Malaysia, our vaccination programme has been accelerated and in three weeks, 90% of our adult population would be fully vaccinated. The adult population is the working population. This has enabled the government to open up the economy gradually and come October, hopefully all sectors will be reopened and we hope that it includes allowing interstate travelling.How can the government help the SMEs? I had asked Teo this question before we left for home.The following day, Teo asked if I remembered about the Export Credit Refinancing (ECR) scheme which was introduced by the government after the 1987 major recession.Of course I remembered. In the late 1980s, I was managing a rubber glove factory and had used the ECR facilities to the maximum. Upon receiving a purchase order (PO) from my customers, I could utilise up to 80% of the PO value to issue letters of credit to my latex supplier, order packaging materials and pay for the gas bills.Upon completion of the order, the money received is first paid to the bank and the balance money is used to pay salaries. Manufacturers could borrow upfront based on a firm order so that production could proceed.Financing cost was at 4% compared to the standard 8%-10% commercial rate of borrowing. It was a Bank Negara initiative, all ECR loans and facilities extended by commercial banks were guaranteed by Credit Guarantee Corporation (CGC), owned by Bank Negara and Malaysian banks.Teo explains more: “As we know, SMEs are the worst hit sector during this pandemic. Most of them have no more working capital even if there is new demand for their products or services.“Most of their existing loans have now turned into non-performing loans (NPL). So they have little chance of getting banks to extend additional facilities to them. Therefore, Bank Negara can introduce a similar funding scheme that can cater to SMEs that have contracts or orders in hand, but need fresh working capital.“These funds can be guaranteed by CGC and also with the condition that part of the new business proceeds must be used to settle the existing NPL.”Teo’s idea is practical and offers an amicable solution to all parties.SMEs will get fresh loans and cash flow to proceed with their operations to fulfil orders. Banks are able to reduce the NPL impact without taking on more risks.The government controls a quantitative easing measure that is directed at productive activities that contributes towards faster growth of our gross domestic product.I would like to expand on Teo’s idea and suggest the following:> Set up a RM100bil SME revival fund. Allocate an amount to the banks based on their respective loan size to the SME sector. CGC can guarantee up to 80% of the new loans extended by the banks to existing SME customers.> Set the interest charged for these loans to not more than 3%. With overnight policy rate at 1.75%, there are sufficient margins for the banks to implement this scheme profitably.> For export business, reintroduce the ECR scheme. For domestic business with orders or contracts in hand, a similar domestic credit refinancing (DCR) scheme can be implemented.The total amount of financing should be about two to three months of rolling future sales. Assuming it makes RM500,000 monthly sales, based on 80% financing, a RM1.2mil DCR facility would be sufficient.> For businesses that depend on future orders like F&B and services, a one-off revival loan can be implemented. Assuming the F&B outlet can generate RM100,000 monthly sales, then an upfront RM100,000 loan repayable over three years can be implemented. This RM100,000 loan will be sufficient to kick-start the business.Bank Negara should consult the various trade associations and banks to ascertain their needs before designing the SOP’s for the SME revival fund.In addition, Bank Negara should open a channel for the unrepresented SMEs to start a dialogue to understand their needs.The ECR and DCR schemes can be implemented quickly and should be implemented before the moratorium expires by the end of this year.With the economy opening up, let us hope that our government will not resort to further lockdowns because the country will plunge into an economic abyss and never recover. We also need the government to ensure proper public health policies go hand in hand with economic activities.The Health Minister has started the vaccination of children from the ages of 12-17 years, but the speed of vaccination will depend on the supply of Pfizer vaccines, which is again delayed.The Education Minister has wisely delayed the starting of the school term and correctly said it should coincide with the vaccination progress of children.Some countries like Singapore have started booster shots of vaccines for the elderly and for cancer patients so I am sure our Health Minister will look into this urgent matter, again subject to the delivery of vaccines.Our Senior Minister for Security has announced that the 181 SOPs will be reduced to just 10 ‘simple to understand’ SOPs.The whole nation will rejoice when the new SOPs are announced. It should be based on vaccination status, public health considerations of wearing masks, sanitisation, social distancing and crowd control.Further considerations will be on self testing, home quarantines and contact tracing. Generalise the instructions for businesses and citizens to follow and make SOPs simple so that it will not be misinterpreted by local enforcement officers.Businesses should not be subjected to International Trade and Industry Ministry approvals anymore.We should not burden the police with applications for interstate travels. The civil service must revert back to pre-Covid efficiency levels. It is unproductive to have to make a booking online for an appointment to submit a document and frustrating to see all slots have been fully booked for the next two weeks.What used to be a simple task of going to a public service department, collect a waiting number and conducting a simple transaction on the same day, must resume immediately.I have never seen any government departments refusing to collect taxes or stamp duties before until this pandemic.The land office is closed, the public have not been able to get road tax since March and the Inland Revenue Department is refusing to collect cheque payments at their counters. Funnily enough, our Finance Minister was lamenting about the low collection of tax revenue.Lastly, the plantation and the manufacturing sectors are screaming for foreign workers to be allowed entry.Since the pandemic started, we have had net outflow of foreign workers returning home upon completion of their contracts as no inflows are allowed. Working mothers are also in search of domestic helpers since their previous helpers have left for home.With the economy opening up quickly, we need to allow entry of new foreign workers and domestic helpers. It is a major revenue for the Home Ministry as workers levy and fees run into hundreds of million a year.Managing this recovery will require all ministries and our civil service to work together, coordinate better and communicate with one voice. And do listen carefully to the voice of desperate SMEs and to the voice of frustrated citizens as GE15 is only two years away.Tan Thiam Hock is an entrepreneur.

      "RISING global oil prices amidst increasing Covid-19 vaccination rates and anticipated higher world economic growth rates in 2022 are brightening the outlook for Malaysia’s oil and gas sector, say research analysts.According to the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) in its latest monthly oil market report, world oil demand is projected to hit 100.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2022, exceeding pre-pandemic levels.This is compared against global oil demand in 2021, which is now projected to average 96.7 million b/d.“As vaccination rates rise, the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to be better managed and economic activities and mobility will firmly return to pre-Covid-19 levels. Steady economic developments are expected to support the partially delayed recovery in oil demand in various sectors,” said the cartel.Opec pointed out that United States growth is forecast at 6.1% in 2021, supported by unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, followed by projected growth of 4.1% in 2022, with further potential upside that may come from additional fiscal stimulus.Growth in the eurozone has also picked up strongly, especially in the second quarter of 2021, with economic growth for the entire year forecast at 4.7%, followed by 3.8% in 2022.Meanwhile, China’s first half of 2021 (H1’21) gross domestic product (GDP) figures confirmed a stable economic recovery, albeit the renewed Covid-19 variant outbreak is forecast to limit 2021 growth at 8.5%.“China’s anticipated softening of the H2’21 growth momentum is forecast to continue into 2022, leading to growth of 6%. India’s growth is forecast at 9% for 2021 and 6.8% in 2022,” said the cartel.Meanwhile, Opec noted that global oil demand in the third quarter of 2021 (Q3’21) has proved to be resilient, supported by rising mobility and travelling activities, particularly in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).However, H2’21 global oil demand has been adjusted slightly lower, partially delaying the oil demand recovery into H1’22 due to the increased risk of Covid-19 cases primarily fuelled by the Delta variant, clouding oil demand prospects going into the final quarter of the year, resulting in downward adjustments to Q4’21 estimates.Meanwhile, AmInvestment Bank Research maintains its “overweight” call on the oil and gas sector, and says it likes Dialog Group Bhd for its resilient non-cyclical tank terminal and maintenance-based operations, as well as Yinson Holdings Bhd’s strong earnings growth momentum from the full-year contributions of floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels Helang, off Sarawak, Abigail-Joseph in Nigeria and Anna Nery in Brazil, plus multiple charter opportunities in Brazil and Africa.The research unit noted that Yinson had recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to supply a mid-sized FPSO vessel to Enauta’s Atlanta field in Brazil.AmInvestment Bank Research also likes Sapura Energy Bhd as its completed RM10bil debt restructuring package positions the formidable engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (EPCIC) group to secure fresh global orders.“Meanwhile, Petronas Gas Bhd offers highly compelling dividend yields from its optimal capital structure strategy and resilient earnings base,” said the research unit.AmInvestment Bank Research is maintaining its 2021 to 2022 oil price projection at US$65 to US$70 (RM271 to RM292) per barrel as Brent crude oil prices have recovered above US$70 (RM292) per barrel currently after falling to US$65 (RM271) per barrel on Aug 20 this year on concerns that the Covid-19 Delta variant could dampen global demand.The research unit said while United States shale production could rebound and Opec may continue to raise production quotas against the backdrop of the brighter oil price environment, this could be mitigated by rising global demand on the back of Covid-19 vaccine rollouts in H2’21.However, AmInvestment Bank Research pointed out that the pandemic had impacted Q2’21 order flows to Malaysian oil and gas operators.“Contract rollouts are still being impacted by the global pandemic, movement restrictions and energy transition policies, which caused Q2’21 awards to decrease 33% quarter-on-quarter to RM2.2bil,” said the research unit. It pointed out that while new contract awards in H1’21 to Malaysian oil and gas operators (excluding Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd in light of its accounting issues raised by its former auditor) rebounded 2.6 times year-on-year to RM5.6bil, largely from multiple jobs awarded to Sapura Energy - the sharp recovery stems from the spending collapse to only RM569mil in Q1’20 due to the earlier Saudi-Russia price war and onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.This is reflected in Petronas’ H1’21 capital expenditure (capex) decreasing by 14% year-on-year to RM12.7bil mainly due to project delays and rephasing of activities caused by movement restriction orders.AmInvestment Bank Research noted that H1’21 appears to be below Petronas’ annual capex plans, accounting for 28% to 32% of the national company’s target of RM40bil to RM45bil over the next five years. As a comparison, H1’21 accounted for 33% to 44% of the group’s capex over the past three years.Petronas plans to spend 55% of the annual capex allocation on domestic investments, with the remainder on international investments.Meanwhile, KAF Equities’ research unit also maintains its “overweight” call on the oil and gas sector, and favours companies with exposure to the downstream and tanker businesses.“The upstream service provider subsegment is showing early signs of recovery,” said the research unit, adding Upstream Online news portal had reported that Petronas Carigali is carrying out studies for the potential deployment of a FPSO vessel on its Sepat oilfield offshore Peninsular Malaysia.While market sources said the concept of an FPSO at Sepat is not new, and there is still no guarantee that it will proceed, KAF Equities said this could still be an opportunity for local FPSO players namely Bumi Armada Bhd, Yinson and MISC due to Petronas previous track record of preference for local service providers.While the size of the potential project is undisclosed for now, KAF Equities estimates the new FPSO might involve daily production capacity of up to 50,000 b/d range for it to be worthwhile for Petronas to spend on the asset upgrade. Also, the Sepat field is likely to require further development or drilling to boost its production to justify extra capex for the new FPSO.KAF Equities said for comparison purposes, it believes it would be smaller than recent proposed supply by Yinson of a mid-sized FPSO vessel to Enauta’s Atlanta field in Brazil, indicating that the potential capex for this Sepat project to be US$500mil (RM2bil) to US$600mil (2.5bil) or lower.“Judging from balance sheet capabilities, we expect MISC and Yinson to be strong candidates if there is a bid, whereas we do not discount the possibility of non-listed players competing as well,” said the research unit.Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research also maintains its “overweight” call on the oil and gas sector, and said its fundamentals are turning positive, with higher oil prices, stronger commitment from Opec+ to keep oil prices afloat, higher impending capex from Petronas in H2’21 albeit not at pre-Covid levels, timeline of vaccine rollouts and the strong economic recovery from China, United States and Europe.HLIB Research’s top picks are Bumi Armada (buy; target price: 80 sen) for its strong FPSO business and fast improving balance sheet and Dialog (buy; target price: RM3.45) as the research unit believes that its share price has bottomed out and its growth in sustainable earnings and potential for further expansions for its tank terminals business will provide upside.The research unit also expects Petronas to elevate its capex spending in H2’21 as its financial performance has improved significantly, and this is expected to benefit most oil and gas services companies in Malaysia.HLIB Research maintains its Brent crude oil price per barrel forecast at US$70 to US$75 (RM292 to RM313) for 2021 and 2022 as its believes that Opec + is committed to provide a good equilibrium for oil prices.“Increasing demand from the re-opening of economies globally would neutralise Opec+’s easing of production cuts, providing a stable oil price of around US$70 (RM292) per barrel in 2021,” said the research unit.However, Kenanga Research maintains its “neutral” call on the sector, saying that undamentals still remain largely weak, with a long-term oil price outlook of US$55 to US$60 (RM229 to RM250) per barrel.Kenanga Research also noted that Petronas group has recently agreed to increase its financial year 2021 (FY’21) dividends by RM7bil to RM25bil, from RM18bil previously.“While the group should have no problems meeting this commitment, given its net-cash position of RM60bil – we do note that this is still halved from two years ago (end-2019 net-cash position of RM117bil),” said the research unit.Kenanga Research also said while upstream is still the largest area of investment for Petronas, it believes this trend of gradually diminishing upstream spending could likely continue, as the group might seek to divert some of its investments into other renewable energy sectors in efforts to keep up with current energy transition trends.Overall, considering Petronas’ increased dividend commitments and efforts in energy transition, the research unit believes the recovery of activity levels – particularly for local-centric contractors (Velesto Energy Bhd, Uzma Bhd, Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd) could still be rather slow.“Realistically, we do not expect activity levels to revert back to pre-pandemic levels any time before 2023”, said Kenanga Research.\n",

      "Johor Corp restructuringJOHOR Corp Bhd is said to be in the midst of a full-scale restructuring. It would be a timely and potentially necessary move for the state investment arm of Johor.As StarBizWeek has highlighted this week, large corporations are being nudged to reorganise themselves in light of the economic distress brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. It is a wake-up call for organisations to future-proof themselves and address environmental, governance and sustainability issues.In JCorp’s case, the group has a massive RM23bil worth of assets but also has RM14bil in liabilities. JCorp has a diverse set of assets, in industries such as plantations, hospitals, fast food chains, property development and real estate development trusts.It also has stakes in a number of listed companies in other industries. In the past, there had been concerns that JCorp had struggled to repay some of its debt and as a holding company, it was one that could boast of owning prized assets but which had not been able to receive sufficient cash returns from its investments.Among the significant corporate exercises that JCorp had been mulling to do include the re-listing of QSR Brands (M) Holdings Bhd, which has more than 1,300 KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in Malaysia and the region.First talk of its listing was in 2019 prior to the pandemic. It is left to be seen how much its profit numbers have been hit in the last two years and if it can secure a decent valuation going to market now.Earlier in the year, there were reports that JCorp was looking to do a corporate exercise involving KPJ Healthcare Bhd, where it owns 38%. The hospital group runs more than 28 specialist hospitals in Malaysia and also has investments in hospitals in Indonesia, Bangkok and Bangladesh as well as in a retirement resort in Australia.Bloomberg had reported that JCorp was looking bringing in an investor with experience in the sector or a merger with another hospital operator. While there are no updates on the QSR listing or the KPJ merger and acquisition deal, JCorp will be closely watched as indications are that it is beginning its restructuring journey.Just this week JCorp increased its stake in Damansara Holdings Bhd after buying a 49.57% stake in the company for RM78.91mil. JCorp had in fact sold that same stake in the company to a businessman in 2014, only to this week buy it back at the same price. It is left to be seen what JCorp does now with the facilities and project management firm.Reversing a boomTHE suspense of Top Glove Corp Bhd’s financial results was not like what it was before when investors were wondering what the impact of the start of the pandemic was on the rubber glove industry.This time, investors were greeted with a more realistic set of financial results after understanding the shutdowns and the tapering prices of rubber gloves have had on the entire rubber glove industry.Top Glove’s financial results were not what analysts were expecting. The fourth-quarter numbers showed a big contraction that was brought about by the shutdown, falling demand and declining prices.Investors have known about the decline in average selling prices of rubber gloves and that was to be expected. Nothing goes up forever in prices. The fall in demand was surprising, possibly execrated by the US import ban, which now has been lifted.But the steep drop in profitability has to be looked from a number of different perspectives. Firstly, the entire dynamics of the industry will change in the quarters ahead. Expect average selling prices to ease ahead and demand too would follow suit as vaccination rates worldwide rises.Stockpiling will no longer be as prevalent as before, which is a factor that also contributed to the spike in selling prices.Then there is the impact on the broader industry. What transpired during the boom times was a rush by new entrants into the market. That also added to the capacity the industry has that was built up by not only capacity expansion by existing players but also companies that have ventured into the business in search of a profit bump.The next few quarters will be interesting to watch in terms of what will be the knock-on effects within the industry, domestically and abroad.The one obvious thing is that the rubber glove companies will be making more money than before the pandemic started and maybe there will be a re-rating to recognise that in the time ahead.Going its own wayFOR the longest time it was always believed that the private sector knows best. That remains largely true but it also depends on the complexity of the situation.And when the business involves utilising government services, then it might make sense why the government might want to get into that act itself rather than leave the profit from a seemingly straightforward business today in the hands of the private sector.The government has spoken about digitalising its services, and after a tug-of-war and a pandemic, the options are really in the favour of getting things done.The government, through the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC), is inviting public feedback on the development of a National Mobile Application or super app.It said the app would potentially allow the public to pay bills, settle traffic summonses, renew driving licences and road tax, book a doctor’s appointment, access e-healthcare services, and register births and marriages online, among others.The success and willingness of the public to adapt to the MySejahtera app will mean that there should be acceptance for a centralised method of utilising digiatlisation to conduct government services. And it does not need to role of the private sector to grant the public access to a suite of services digitally.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: The government will channel RM500mil of assistance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) through the Prihatin Special Grant (GKP) 4.0 beginning Sept 21, says Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.“With this aid, it is hoped that small businesses such as food stalls, barbers, workshops and cake shops will be able to reduce their burden and help in their cash flow,” he said.Each payment of RM500 will be given out in September and November.The Prime Minister said the grant, which is a component of the Economic Recovery Package (Pemulih), will benefit more than one million recipients.In a statement yesterday, he said the aid would be transferred directly into bank accounts registered with the GKP system.The status of the GKP 4.0 can be checked at gkp.hasil.gov.my.So far, he said RM6.08bil had been channelled to SMEs under the GKP since the pandemic began.“I hope this aid will be able to revive the SME sector, which is the engine of economic growth for the Malaysian family.”The government, he said, would give priority to industry players who were among those most affected during the pandemic.Meanwhile, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz said the status of those who applied and then appealed for the Bantuan Prihatin Rakyat (BPR) can be checked at bpr.hasil.gov.my starting today.This will involve almost 200,000 BPR recipients with an estimated allocation of RM240mil, said Tengku Zafrul, adding that the payments would be credited at the end of this month into accounts registered with the BPR.He said in a statement the payout would also be given to recipients of the third phase of the BPR.Tengku Zafrul said the government had updated the data of the B40 group eligible to receive the BPR after their appeals were submitted from June 15 to June 30.The appeals were verified by the Inland Revenue Board to ensure that the aid would benefit those who qualified for it.“The government hopes that this cash assistance totalling RM17.1bil until the end of the year can assist Malaysian families in managing their expenses,” he said.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: EcoWorld Development Group Bhd (EcoWorld Malaysia) reported robust sales growth in the third quarter ended July 31 (Q3’21), boosted by its success in converting digital leads into purchases during the MCO lockdown period.EcoWorld Malaysia recorded RM2.873bil sales in Q3’21 and by Aug 31, sales had reached RM3.11bil.Sales increased by more than RM1bil since Q2’21 enabling the group to surpass its full year target for FY’2021 of RM2.875bil.President and CEO Datuk Chang Khim Wah attributed the sales outperformance to “agility in pursuing on-line leads aggressively.”He cited the effectiveness of the group’s digitalisation initiatives (from frontline to backroom processes) which enabled systematic follow-through with potential customers and conversion of leads into sales online.But despite the sales jump, the group’s results were impacted by the government imposed lockdown in June and July.Revenue during the third quarter (Q3’21) declined to RM449mil from RM478mil a year ago. Net profit slipped to RM35.2mil compared with RM35.8mil previously.Chang expects construction work to pick up pace as the economy reopens.“Now that 100% of our staff who are medically eligible for vaccination and more than 80% of site workers are fully vaccinated, all of EcoWorld Malaysia’s construction sites are able to operate at full capacity, which will enable us to catch up on work progress,” he said.“We have also been permitted to reopen our sales galleries, and are therefore able to welcome customers to visit us once again to personally view our projects and properties, which is still an important step in the buying process for many,” he added.“This will enable EcoWorld Malaysia to proceed with our plans for the launch of several new phases before the end of the year to build up a strong pipeline of sales for the upcoming year,” he said.Adding overseas sales during the first ten-month up until Aug 31, the total group-wide sales has breached the RM4bil mark.EcoWorld International Bhd reported RM338mil sales in Q3’21, and a further RM81mil in August 2021.This lifted its year-to-date sales to RM1.04bil, plus reserves of RM285mil that added to RM1.33bil as of end of August.EcoWorld Group’s share of future revenue as at Aug 31 remained high at RM4.1bil – RM3.72bil contributed by its Malaysian projects whilst EcoWorld Malaysia’s attributable share of EcoWorld International’s future revenue stands at RM386mil.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: With Astro Malaysia Holdings Bhd bringing in more channels and streamers from Hollywood giants, the group’s content cost-to-TV revenue is likely to remain between 34% to 37%.There has been changes in Astro Malaysia’s channel lineup and also an addition of 15 subscription-based video-on-demand services expected by the end of financial year ending Jan 31, 2023.CGS-CIMB Research said Astro Malaysia has been getting more than it bargained for from the Hollywood studios over the year as its content cost has been stable since its re-listing in October 2012.“It is the international media giants that have more to lose if piracy upends their streaming gambit in Asia.“The video streaming market surfeit and subscriber fatigue are slowing down their growth in the United States, yet they continue to be mounted by high production costs to satisfy subscribers’ demand for content.“With the streaming integration and international media giants’ backing against piracy, we are hopeful that an earnings resurgence is in sight,” added the research house.Astro Malaysia is bringing in 13 new television channels to replace 11 channels owned by The Walt Disney Co, which will go off-air by end of this month.Replacing these channels is part of the media giant’s effort to reduce its exposure to linear broadcasting in international markets.According to CGS-CIMB Research, this is proof to the global media corporations depending on Astro Malaysia to get their direct-to-customer projects to work.As such, the research house is keeping an “add” call on Astro Malaysia with a target price of RM1.51.Currently, Astro Malaysia is trading at a 74.9% discount to the global pay-TV and streaming players’ weighted average enterprise value and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of 23.1 times for calendar year 2021 forecast.The research house believes that Astro Malaysia has decided to “replenish its channel count rather than taking this as an opportunity to cut its content costs further” because of its viewers that like to watch whatever is on television compared to choosing on what to watch.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: AirAsia X Bhd (AAX) has made “substantial progress” in months-long talks with creditors as it aims to convene meetings with them to vote on a restructuring scheme by the end of October, its chief executive said.CEO Benyamin Ismail told Reuters in a telephone interview that negotiations and discussions with lessors, planemaker Airbus SE and service providers have progressed, but declined to detail what had been agreed.The airline, an affiliate of AirAsia Group, has also been talking to potential investors for its recapitalisation, and hopes to complete discussions by the end of the year.“We plan to raise funding in December and get that completed as soon as possible. We’re talking to everybody, we’ll get more colour towards the year-end,” Benyamin said, declining to reveal details about the potential investors but adding that there were more than a handful of them.Benyamin said talks with creditors are in the final stages and all have indicated they want to see the airline proceed with its restructuring.“We’re quite confident that we’ll get this through. The main commercial terms are already out of the way,” he said, referring to negotiations with lessors. There were no objections to a proposal to move engine maker Rolls-Royce Group into the same classification as most other creditors, he added.In a court document filed on Monday, AAX said negotiations are still afoot but “various letters of undertaking have been secured” from creditors.Many lessors have already struck other agreements with South-East Asia airlines to take back planes early or reduce rates, at least temporarily, to help them survive the plunge in air travel caused by coronavirus pandemic.“Drafts of the lock up agreements and term sheets were sent to the lessors on May 18. The lessors are presently in the process of reviewing them,” AAX said.The airline told the court that it has received signed letters of undertaking from three large creditors to support and vote for the scheme, namely Honeywell International, Bridgestone Aircraft Tire Company and Sky High I Leasing Company.AAX proposed last October to restructure RM64.15bil (US$15.4bil) of debt, a plan that drew objections from more than a dozen of creditors, many of whom are lessors.Airbus, the airline’s biggest creditor, filed an affidavit in December saying it stands to lose more than US$5bil (RM21bil) worth of orders if the scheme goes through. It declined to comment on the restructuring process.This week, the court granted AAX an extension to hold its creditors meetings by March next year, when a restraining order preventing creditors from filing fresh lawsuits against the airline expires too. — Reuters\n",

      "THE rising number of Covid-19 cases since early May 2021 resulted in a nationwide movement control order (MCO 3.0) in mid-May, which was followed by a nationwide lockdown in early June.The restrictive measure has paralysed large parts of economic and social activities across the country.As a consequences of the stringent measures, manufacturing activities in several key areas were affected severely, in particular Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. Factories were forced to scale down their operations or shut down to comply with the new measures to address the pandemic.The restrictive measures affected a wide range of industries and suppliers in these regions and this resulted in a crippling impact on the global manufacturing supply chains which struggled with supply capacities and delivery times. It will be tough for them to clear their backlogs of orders swiftly.An important point to note here is that manufacturers and suppliers in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur are varied, including high-value manufacturing industries in the fields of engineering and manufacturing, automotive, healthcare, chemicals and technology and many others.As a result, it also impacted companies outside Selangor and Kuala Lumpur which experienced disruptions as their sub-tier suppliers are located in the two affected regions.Companies that produce capacitors for the automotive and telecommunications industries, and medical device makers were hit by the MCO 3.0 as many of their sub-tier suppliers located in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur were forced to shut down.The impact from MCO 3.0 caused those in the automotive and iron and steel segments to halt their operations until the restrictive measures were relaxed. Several carmakers closed their factories on June 1.And even sectors that were allowed to operate at 60% of their workforce shut down their operations temporarily due to the pandemic outbreak, labour shortages or other operational challenges.For instance, our big players in areas like styrene monomer producer, refined tin maker, semiconductor players, electronic components makers and many more had to stop operations. Meanwhile, factories which were allowed to operate without restrictions under MCO 3.0 experienced a drop in productivity.The Semiconductor Industry Association found that MCO 3.0 had reduced our semiconductor output by 15%-40% and cut inventory levels although semiconductor makers were exempted from the restrictions due to supply issues, labour shortages and rising Covid-19 cases.Major component suppliers who manufacture multi-layer ceramic capacitors and crystal oscillators used in a wide range of electronic products were all affected.The crippling impact from MCO 3.0 was reflected in the headline IHS Markit Malaysia manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI).Data from the PMI suggested that output slipped for the fourth month in a row. It started in May with a reading of 51.3 from 53.9 in April and eventually dipped to 39.9 in June. It has been in the contraction region defined by the “50” threshold since June. In August, the reading came in at 43.4 from 40.1 in July.The PMI data showed that the pace of the reduction remained marked, suggesting a moderation in manufacturing output and broadly stagnant gross domestic product (GDP).This could be attributed to the lack of demand due to poor customer and consumer confidence, shortages of inputs causing companies to reduce production and holding back projects while new export orders did not pick up as Covid-19 cases also rose in key external markets.And there was a renewed drop in employment while input cost climbed for the 15th consecutive month in August due to rising prices for raw materials and logistics.This severe impact from MCO 3.0 should result in a slight contraction in third-quarter GDP as the country will be still reeling from lockdowns and the dissipating base effect.Overall, the economy grew at 7.1% y-o-y in the first half of 2021 from a decline of 8.4% y-o-y during the first half of 2020.The near-term economic outlook remains tilted to the downside amid uncertainties which include a risk of slower recovery should there be a delay in reopening the economy on account of a delayed resolution of the pandemic, outbreaks of new viral variants both internally and externally, prolonged tight containment measures with phase four of the National Recovery Plan starting in 2022, policy uncertainty and a slower recovery in the labour market.On that note, the full-year economic growth for 2021 would likely hover between 3% and 3.5%. And the economic outlook for 2022 should be more promising supported by the reopening of most economic sectors and the positive spillovers from continued improvement in external demand.The overnight policy rate (OPR), which is at a historical low of 1.75%, is expected to stay for the rest of the year. The current monetary settings are sufficiently accommodative to support growth.Lowering the OPR will likely result in banks becoming more cautious in lending, more so following the announcement of a repayment moratorium.For FX enquiries, please contact: ambank-fx-research@ambankgroup.com.

      "MANAGING the health of your finances has become more imperative as the pandemic continues to have an impact on the earnings of many Malaysians.With many facing financial difficulties, spending responsibly is becoming a new normal.Educating the younger generation with financial literacy before they enter the workforce is becoming more important.Even prior to the pandemic, many youths in Malaysia have not shown strong financial discipline. Three years ago, Bank Negara stated that 47% of Malaysian youth had high credit card debt.A global survey by Standard Chartered last year revealed that 74% of millennials in Malaysia found managing their money more difficult since the start of the pandemic.However, the survey showed that around 28% of millennials have started using a money management or budgeting app since the pandemic began, while another 62% plan to do so in the next three years, in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.To help solve these issues, Kiplepay Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of tech firm Green Packet Bhd, recently rolled out the Kiplepay prepaid visa card tied to an e-wallet.Targeting university students, the payment card with money preloaded linked to an e-wallet would soon allow users to track their spending and control their expenses.According to Kiplepay acting chief executive officer Ricky Lew, the new features would enable better financial literacy and financial management among the youth from an early age.“Students would be able to view their weekly top spending in their e-wallet, and can even key in their savings goals. The card will also motivate students with incentives such as cashback to help them achieve their goals,” he tells StarBizWeek.He explains that learning good financial management skills at a young age is not a life skill taught in schools in the country compared to the United States which has included financial literacy as part of their syllabus.“We will be developing even more financial management solutions for these young students to help them be better at managing money,” notes Lew.It is important to note that no transaction fee is charged except for the 1% transaction charged for overseas spending.There are various prepaid cards in the market including AirAsia’s BigPay, Merchantrade Money Visa prepaid card, GoPayz-MAIPk, MRCA Visa prepaid card, eGen Visa prepaid card targeting different segments of the population.For Kiplepay’s Visa prepaid card, Lew says the newly launched service is one of the first e-wallets with a Visa card in the country targeting students.“We will be introducing more specific student services and propositions in the near future – stay tuned” points out Lew.Given its partnership with Visa, students will be able to perform cashless transactions with Visa’s 71 million merchants in over 200 countries.Last month, Kiplepay teamed up with Visa to introduce this first of its kind prepaid card- Kiple Visa prepaid card.It is noteworthy that in countries such as Singapore, these prepaid Visa card models have become popular among the youth.Similar to Kiplepay, the prepaid visa card brand Canvas in the island republic has acted as a teaching tool for the youth to learn how to prioritise allotted pocket money prudently.Meanwhile, Kiplepay has also expanded its payment and e-wallet solution, with a prepaid card for enterprises – the Kiple White Label prepaid card – a solution for businesses looking to create their own e-wallets with payment solutions within a quick four month’s time frame.Lew says the prepaid card for enterprises would allow companies to disburse salaries into the e-wallet with a spending Visa card.“The card will allow employees to manage and control their funds from one location without having to visit a bank and open up a bank account, which can also be a lengthy process,” he adds.In light of the new normal of different operating hours of banks amid the pandemic, Lew says the prepaid card is a more accessible choice for businesses to manage and track their employees salaries and expenses.“Today, foreign and gig workers are left behind in the cashless race as it is challenging for them to open new bank account to receive salaries.“This card linked to the e-wallet will make it more convenient for employers to ensure each employee receives the necessary funds safely,” he explains.In the last two years, Kiplepay has collaborated with state governments to disburse welfare funds to over 50,000 families through its Kiple-enabled Aid Distribution prepaid cards.The Kiple platform also allowed the government to track where and how the welfare funds were spent.The recently launched Kiplepay Visa prepaid card also allows cash withdrawals at bank ATMs, though at a fee of RM2 per withdrawal, which is the same fee other non-bank issued prepaid cards charge.Nonetheless, Lew says the prepaid card’s objective is not to perform as an ATM card but to be used for cashless transactions amid the acceleration in adoption of digital solutions.Since the launch last month, Lew says the company has received around 2,000 sign-ups for the prepaid card.Within a year, he expects to have about 1.5 million customers using the cards.Undoubtedly, Kiplepay Visa prepaid cards with the upcoming features of financial planning would help upskill the youth in financial literacy.“It is important to know where you spend and the kind of expenses you have. This kind of tool will help students to determine the essential items in their budget and have a better control on spending money that will tide us through this crisis.“On a bigger picture, this would help in the digitalisation of financial information on an e-wallet,” adds Yap, who is the founder and managing director of Whitman Independent Advisors Sdn Bhd.\n",

It is the lowest during the pandemic and is indicating the pandemic is under control,\" Luhut told a news conference.Other positive signs included the national hospital bed occupancy rate falling below 15%, while the positivity rate, or the proportion of people tested who are positive, was at less than 5%, he said.Luhut said if the trend today continued \"we are very confident\" that Bali could be reopened by October.South Korea, Japan, Singapore and New Zealand, are among countries the government is considering accepting foreign nationals from first, given the low virus spread in those nations, he said.Indonesia's health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin told Reuters earlier this week that reopening to foreigners also hinged upon 70% of the target population receiving their first COVID-19 shot.More than 21% of the targeted 208 million have been fully vaccinated, while almost 40% have received their first shot, according to health ministry data.Malaysia this week reopened its Langkawi island to domestic visitors, while Thailand has opened Phuket and Samui islands to vaccinated foreign tourists and Vietnam's idyllic Phu Quoc island plans to follow suit.Indonesia has grappled with one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia, recording over 4.1 million cases and 140,000 deaths, although public health experts believe the true figures are likely several times higher.- Reuters\n",

      "NEW YORK: World shares fell on Friday after a week of mixed economic data and fears over the stability of growth and Asian markets put the focus on the U.S. Federal Reserve's timeline for tapering asset purchases.U.S. stocks ended sharply lower in a broad sell-off on Friday. All three major U.S. stock indexes lost ground, with the Nasdaq Composite Index weighed down as rising U.S. Treasury yields pressured market-leading growth stocks.The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield briefly touched 1.3855%, its highest level since July 14, while the dollar hit a three-week high.MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.71%, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index closed down 0.9% for a third-straight week of losses. So far this month, the STOXX is down about 2%.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.29%.Investors hope the Fed's meeting next week will yield more clarity on its plan to slow down asset purchases, and when it might raise interest rates.Shares in embattled property developer China Evergrande , which has two trillion yuan ($310 billion) in liabilities and faces an $80 million bond coupon payment next week, dropped 30% this week.Concerns grew that a potential U.S. corporate tax hike could erode earnings as leading Democrats and President Joe Biden sought to raise the top tax rate on corporations to 26.5% from the current 21%.\"Fear seems to be creeping back into the market, and that can be a healthy dynamic, said Callie Cox, Ally Invest senior investment strategist. \"We wouldn't be surprised to see a pullback here.\"The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 166.44 points, or 0.48%, to 34,584.88; the S&P 500 lost 40.76 points, or 0.91%, at 4,432.99; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 137.96 points, or 0.91%, to 15,043.97.The 10-year Treasury note yield rose 3.9 basis points to 1.3702%.The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the euro zone, was at -0.280% after rising as much as 3.5 basis points to a two-month high of -0.277%, after a Financial Times report suggested the European Central Bank expects to hit its 2% inflation target by 2025.Stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales data on Thursday boosted the dollar, which held steady near the previous day's three-week high against an index of currencies.The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's value against six major currencies, rose 0.387%, its highest since late August.The euro down 0.32% to $1.1726.Spot gold dropped 0.1% to $1,752.48 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.26% to $1,749.40 an ounce.U.S. crude recently fell 64 cents to $71.97 per barrel, and Brent settled at $75.34 a barrel, down 33 cents on the day.- Reuters\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: Sad, shocked and speechless.That summed up national women’s diver Nur Dhabitah Sabri’s (pic)emotions after it was announced that her coach Christian Brooker is set to leave the diving camp soon.Describing the Australian coach as akin to her “own father” in diving, the 22-year-old said Brooker’s departure was indeed a big loss as he was the one who made her fall in love with diving once more after she had endured such a torrid time previously.This, Dhabitah said, was due to the fact that she almost gave up diving more than a year ago.It was Brooker’s “never say die” spirit that made her pick herself up and start again.“Because of him, I started to love diving again. I almost gave up and felt that diving was useless, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic hit worldwide,” she said.“It was really tense to train under the sports bubble concept and the fact that I had to part ways with my family for a while made me feel more sad. But I was glad to have Brooker around as he always encouraged me and boosted my spirit to participate in Japan.”The Kuala Lumpur-born athlete said she would definitely miss the 40-year-old coach as he was easy to communicate with, and she felt at ease sharing her problems with him, be it professional or personal issues.Not only that, Dhabitah, who had been under the tutelage of Brooker since 2018, admitted that she never had a dull moment with him and appreciated the way he infused more joy and fun into their training sessions.“He was very supportive, he was not rough towards us - what’s more he doesn’t say mean words during training. He always gave me and other divers the freedom and was easy to discuss things with on any changes that we feel better suit us as the divers.“I like the way he handled the setback in the Tokyo Olympics recently; he never holds grudges and still offers positive feedback regardless of the outcome,” she added.Despite missing out on winning a medal for the country in her second Olympics in Japan, Dhabitah stole the hearts of Malaysians with her commendable performance and radiant smile to finish fourth at the Tokyo Aquatics Centre last month. — Bernama\n",

      "YOUNGSTERS Emma Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez took the world of tennis by storm last week with their incredible performances in the US Open.At 18, Raducanu became a Grand Slam champion and the first from England to win it in 44 years.She defeated a worthy opponent in 19-year-old Fernandez from Canada - in a match that marked the emergence of future stars who will continue to bring the fans, revenue, and attention to the sport.But young as they may be, their success was not achieved overnight or without any hardships.The duo have many things in common – they are bright, hard-working, and talented; they have come through good junior programmes; they have a good team behind them; they speak confidently, and what they say reflects good sportsmanship and their quality as players.In the US too, two of our Malaysian youngsters gave the country something to cheer about in collegiate golf over the last two weeks when the 20-year-olds Liyana Durisic and Zulaikah Nurziana Nasser emerged as winners at the Wolverine International in Michigan and USA Intercollegiate in Alabama respectively.They too had made many sacrifices, like leaving their families behind, in pursuit of success.While these tennis and golf youngsters are looking ahead to the future with much hope and determination to excel even further, right at home in Malaysia, shuttler Goh Jin Wei – just one year older than the budding golf stars – has turned her back on it all.Jin Wei has chosen to give up the sport that she loves and announced her retirement on Monday, which came as a shock to many.From her junior days, the tiny gem from Penang has been simply outstanding.Shorter than most of her opponents, she would take part in categories with the bigger girls and get huge satisfaction in beating them.She did not let her physical disadvantage stop her from toying with her opponents through intelligent play and gung-ho performances.At 16, she was the country’s national champion.The two-time world junior champion then went on to save the blushes for Malaysia by winning the solitary badminton gold at the 2017 Kuala Lumpur SEA Games – when all other favourites wilted under the pressure at home.I still remember the roar of fans shouting and cheering her on with Jia You! Jin Wei! Jia You! Jin Wei! repeatedly at the almost full Axiata Arena in Bukit Jalil during the semi-finals of the KL Games against the favourite Pornpawee Chochuwong of Thailand.She was touted as a future medallist in the Olympics Games but just before the Tokyo Olympics, injuries and health issues affected her form, fire, and self-belief.She got better just before the start of 2020 but the Covid-19 pandemic delivered a further blow when she was unable to compete – and with her ranking having plummeted from 24 to 128, it became harder.It’s understandable that Jin Wei is going through a hard time. It’s not easy to revive the fire that had once burnt bright.On the one hand, she wants to give her best and on the other, as much as she tries, it’s mentally tiring for her battered mind and body to come out from one’s lowest pit.It’s not that help had not been extended to Jin Wei.The Badminton Association of Malaysia (BAM) had offered to give her the best treatment by sending her overseas to look into her injury and there was also an option of taking a short break and switching to another event.But Jin Wei has to first deal with the tug-of-war in her mind. There will always be factors that one can’t control.It could range from constant changes, selection issues, an unconducive environment, different coaching styles, and even unkind words hurled by others.There could be other challenges too. Only the players know the pressures they face.Physical injuries will heal. Just look at Soniia Cheah – she battled through her injuries to finally make that trip to the Tokyo Olympic Games.It’s our hope that Jin Wei will get the right advice from those who see her talent and care for her.Eventually, with good counsel, she may make a U-turn to give her badminton career another shot – and we believe there are many good years ahead of her.I’m sure the BAM will welcome her back or even give her the blessings to turn pro.But it all depends on where her heart – and her mind – is.If it’s not in the game, we can wish her the best to move on.But if badminton remains her first love, she could yet conquer the world and stand smiling victoriously – as Raducanu did.\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: National junior shuttler Fazriq Razif has finally decided to follow the path taken by his legendary father by focusing on the men’s doubles.And the 17-year-old Fazriq has been given a new partner, Wong Vin Sean, to realise his dream.Their first tournament will be the German Under-19 Inter–national from Oct 13-17 in Mulheim. They will also compete in the Czech Republic International from Oct 21-24 in Brno and the Belgian International from Oct 27-30 in Leuven.This means Fazriq’s partnership with Justin Hoh in the doubles is over as the latter has decided to concentrate only on the singles.In the world junior rankings, the two are the best Malaysian pair, lying at fifth spot.Together with Justin, Fazriq had won the Bangladesh Junior International title, finished runners-up in the Malaysia Junior International and won several other local age-group titles.In their last tournament together this year, the duo went down in the second round of the Austrian Open, which was a senior tournament.Fazriq said he was excited about his new journey in his bid to emulate his father Razif Sidek, who ruled the badminton scene in the doubles with brother Jalani in the 1980s and early 1990s.“I’m still training in both the singles and doubles at the centre but I’ve made up my mind to choose the doubles,” said Fazriq, who is in the national junior squad headed by Datuk Misbun Sidek.“I’ve been asked to play both for the time being in the junior ranks but it will be doubles all the way after this.“As Justin is not keen on the doubles, I’ve started training with Vin Sean, who is also 17. Our first test will be the German juniors and we hope to get off to a good start,” said Fazriq.The junior singles players train under Hazwan Jamaluddin while the doubles players are handled by former international Vountus Indra Mawan.\n",

      "WOLVERHAMPTON, England (Reuters) -Brentford claimed their first away victory in the Premier League with a 2-0 success at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday, keeping a clean sheet despite going down to 10 men midway through the second half.The victory was promoted Brentford's second of the season after beating Arsenal on the opening day and the club's first away win in the top flight in 74 years as Thomas Frank's side provisionally moved up to ninth in the standings.Livewire striker Ivan Toney scored and grabbed an assist in a busy first half in which he also had two goals disallowed, but the visitors were forced to defend for the last half hour when Shandon Baptiste was sent off for a second yellow card.\"We did well (in the) first half and could have scored more, but the second half showed the character we've got in the dressing room,\" Toney said.\"In the Premier League you have to be deadly when you get the opportunity. I think we deserved the three points in the end.\"Brentford earned a first-half penalty when Wolves wingback Marcal grabbed Toney in the box during a set piece and brought him down, with the striker stepping up and sending Jose Sa the wrong way from the spot to give the away side the lead.Toney then turned provider for Bryan Mbeumo, shrugging off a tackle in his run down the left channel before crossing to his strike partner at the far post and the unmarked Frenchman made no mistake with a tap in for his first Premier League goal.Brentford were reduced to 10 when Baptiste received a second booking after losing possession and hauling Trincao down in panic, leaving manager Frank fuming on the sidelines as he was about to make a substitution.But Brentford held on as Bruno Lage's Wolves side, who had numerous shots on goal but not one on target, continue to seek their first home win of the season.\"These players are amazing and they keep... surprising me isn't the word, but impressing me,\" Frank said.\"It was a very impressive, brave performance. In the second half we were down to 10 men but we defended with our heart and soul. We gave only one big chance away and that's very impressive.\"(Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: It will be back to coaches from China as Malaysia look to regain their status in diving.Malaysia Swimming (MS) are likely to engage Chinese coaches to turn their divers into medal winners again at the 2024 Paris Olympics and this will be discussed during a joint committee meeting with the National Sports Council (NSC) next week.MS are on the lookout for a coach as the NSC did not renew the contract of Australian coach Christian Brooker, who has been with the Malaysian diving team for almost four years.His contract ends after this month but Brooker has been on leave since early this week.The 40-year-old, who had worked with the juniors in Australia and England before this, was brought in to assist Zhang Yukun from China after Yang Zhuliang’s contract as the head coach was not renewed in late 2017.Yukun then left after the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and another Chinese coach Li Rui was brought in.Both Li Rui and Brooker were in charge of the preparations for the diving team leading to the Tokyo Olympics last month. In Tokyo, Malaysia failed to win any medals.Andy Low, head of the diving committee for MS, said they would be recommending a new Chinese coach to replace Brooker.“We will try out a different approach. We did not do as well as what we had hoped for at the Tokyo Olympics last month and we need to find ways to improve,” said Andy.“Paris is just three years away and we may have to review our training programme to bring back a medal again.“The synchro events are still our best hope and we have to identify our divers now.“We did not have any male representative in Tokyo and we hope to change that in Paris.”The fate of the other coaches handling the national team will also be reviewed but Li Rui’s position should be safe as Pandelela Rinong took gold at the Diving World Cup in May.The national body will also have to identify new back-up divers to be ready for the Olympics qualification for Paris and find a replacement for the 36-year-old Leong Mun Yee, who competed in her last Olympics in Tokyo.In Tokyo, Nur Dhabitah Sabri was the only bright spark when she finished fourth in the women’s 3m springboard individual final.Pandelela-Mun Yee went to Tokyo as medal contenders but finished eighth in the women’s 10m platform synchro final while Pandelela missed out on a third straight Olympics medal after a nightmare opening dive in the individual event.Pandelela, who won bronze and silver in London 2012 and Rio de Janeiro 2016, was placed last in the field of 12 finalists.\n",

      "THE match against Crystal Palace will test Liverpool’s credentials as the “mentality monsters” Juergen Klopp has made them out to be.Having earned a hard-fought 3-2 win over AC Milan during the UEFA Champions League group stage match, the Reds are facing the Eagles just two days later.With barely enough time to rest, let alone prepare for the match, it will be a tough game for Liverpool.Crystal Palace will be out to wear down the Merseysiders with their high intensity play.They will be soaring high with confidence after demolishing Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 last week.It must be said that under the stewardship of Arsenal legend Patrick Vieira, the Eagles are playing with more urgency now, like how they suppressed Tottenham’s attack, limiting them to only just two shots the entire game.Crystal Palace, meanwhile, had 18 shots and 63% possession.Wilfried Zaha in particular played very well, tormenting the Spurs’ defence with his speed and trickery and will be the threat Liverpool needs to be wary of.Another threat would be new signing from Celtic, Odsonne Edouard who had a dream debut with two goals and could even make the starting line-up in place of former Reds Christian Benteke.It was quite a surprise to see how Klopp kept Virgil van Dijk on the bench against AC Milan, surely with one eye on Palace.The German is not particularly known for rotating his players but perhaps he did so to keep his team fresh as the Netherlands captain now looks certain to start.Players with injury records like Joel Matip and Jordan Henderson should also perhaps be rested now to minimise the risk of injuries.It is fortunate that the Reds are blessed with options at the back and in midfield, with the attack the only concern.In midfield, Fabinho continues to show why he is indispensable and will likely retain his place.Thiago Alcantara also did well and would merit a spot alongside Naby Keita, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Curtis Jones or James Milner.Up front, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Diogo Jota are expected to start again, with Takumi Minamino and Divock Origi acting as back-up.Overall, Liverpool have a good record against Palace — 33 wins, 11 draws and 14 defeats.The Reds have also won the last four home league games and will hope to have enough in their tank to maintain their record and winning streak against the visiting side.\n",

But we recovered really well. We had good structure, made good attacking moves and created many chances.\"Nagelsmann, in his first season at Bayern, is looking to extend their record title run to 10 consecutive league crowns.\"The aim of course is the 10th (straight) league title. I am new here and I want to pick up where my predecessors left off,\" Nagelsmann said. \"The lads are ambitious and always ready to go to the limit.\"Bayern opened their account with their first shot on goal when Leroy Sane curled a free kick over the wall in the 17th minute.He then set up Kimmich for their second goal 10 minutes later with the midfielder latching onto Sane's clever cross into the box before turning on the spot and firing in.Bayern, who beat Barcelona 3-0 in Spain earlier this week in their Champions League group stage opener, made it 3-0 in the 33rd with Serge Gnabry charging through to score.Bochum's first half misery was complete when Vasillis Lampropoulos scored an own goal as he attempted to pass the ball in front of Bayern striker Lewandowski.The Pole did get on the scoresheet in the 61st, tapping in from close range and becoming the first Bundesliga player to score in 13 consecutive home games.Lewandowski, who set a Bundesliga record with 41 league goals last season, has already scored seven times in Bayern's first five league games so far this term.With the home fans conducting Mexican waves in the stands, Bayern kept up the pressure, adding a sixth through Kimmich in the 65th before substitute Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting drilled in number seven in the 79th to complete Bochum's misery.Wolfsburg host Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday when Borussia Dortmund, in fourth on nine points, welcome Union Berlin.(Reporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Ken Ferris and Hugh Lawson)\n",

I was delighted with the way we got through that.\"Lock Tupou Vaa'i grabbed a brace of tries, while Patrick Tuipulotu, scrumhalf TJ Perenara and hooker Samisoni Taukei'aho also scored five-pointers as the All Blacks continued their rampaging form after hammering the Pumas 39-0 on the Gold Coast last Sunday.It could have been much worse for Argentina as Foster's side missed out on three tries in the first half and another in the second.Two early tries were cancelled due to forward passes and a third to Rieko Ioane was ruled out before halftime after the centre lunged over illegally when brought down under the posts.Young scrumhalf Finlay Christie blew the fourth when he fumbled the ball forward a metre out from an undefended line.The injury-hit Pumas slumped to their fourth successive loss after opening defeats away to South Africa, but it was a better performance by Mario Ledesma's side.The All Blacks took a 24-3 lead into the second half but Pumas winger Emiliano Boffelli grabbed a 51st minute try and his conversion shaved the deficit to 16 points.But New Zealand defended strongly in the last quarter before Vaa'i cantered over unmarked three minutes from the siren for his second try as a tired defence surrendered.Foster said the All Blacks would celebrate the win but was unfazed about the world number one ranking.\"It doesn't feel like you're ever going to be at the top until you beat the team that's at the top so let's just wait and see,\" he said.(Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n",

      "(Reuters) - After a trophy-laden two-decade stint overseas, former Liverpool goalkeeper Brad Jones is returning to his native Western Australia to fulfil a career-long ambition when he runs out for Perth Glory.Born and raised in the city's north-eastern suburbs, the 39-year-old has signed for the club he followed as a youth during Perth's first season in professional football in 1995.A circuitous journey that started in 1999 and took him to England, the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia was completed last month when he signed as a free agent for Richard Garcia's side.Now Jones is relishing working under his former Socceroos team mate as Perth prepare to launch their challenge for the A-League title when the competition returns at the end of October.\"It's something that I always wanted to do was to play for Perth,\" said Jones. \"As a kid growing up this was the first step that you looked to.\"I used to come and watch the games from the inaugural season and it was something that when the opportunity came I was interested in taking it.\"I know Richie as well from a long time ago, also being in the national team, so that was good, someone I was familiar with and that I knew I would be happy working with.\"Jones brings trophy-winning experience with him to a Perth side that finished a disappointing ninth in the 12-team A-League set-up last year.He picked up a pair of League Cup winners medals at Middlebrough and Liverpool while serving as understudy to Mark Schwarzer and Pepe Reina respectively before establishing himself as first choice goalkeeper with Feyenoord.The goalkeeer played 32 times for the Rotterdam club as they won the Dutch title in the 2016/17 season before earning a Dutch Cup winners medal a year later.Jones followed that with a move to Saudi Arabia's Al Nassr in 2018, where he helped the Riyadh-based side win the Saudi Professional League title for the first time in four years.\"Over the past few years I've selected where I've gone and I've been fortunate from my time at Liverpool...the club became successful and I wanted more of that,\" he said.\"But I wanted to be out there playing. My time in Holland was very successful and was something that was a massive step for me, to become the first keeper and also to achieve what we achieved.\"And Saudi was the same. I wasn't going there to play for anyone. I did my research and made sure the club was going to be challenging, and fortunately I managed to get some trophies there as well.\"I'm looking for the same thing here. From what I've seen it's positive, but we've got to work and I need to be able to put my experiences to the boys and try to help them as well.\"While the lure of home was strong, Jones insists the move to Perth Glory is not purely a sentimental one.\"I wasn't interested in going just anywhere and working with just anyone,\" he said.\"It had to be the right move for me and this appealed to me. Working with these people and this group was a massive pull.\"(Reporting by Michael Church, Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)\n",

      "SPURS face their toughest test yet when they play Chelsea at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in a London derby this weekend.It is a fixture that can go some way to laying bare just how far Nuno Espirito Santo’s side still has to go before they entertain realistic aspirations of challenging the Big Four — Manchester City, Liverpool, tomorrow’s visitors and Manchester United.Tottenham got off to their best start yet in the Premier League when chalking up three wins on the trot, including the narrow victory over champions City, who appeared wobbly in their opener.But then they came down to earth with a heavy thud last weekend when Crystal Palace registered their first triumph of the new campaign.And against a Chelsea side that is brimming with confidence and spearheaded by the free-scoring Romelu Lukaku, Spurs could find themselves with even greater pain to deal with.Chelsea are locked in a four-way tie at the top of the Premiership after four matches and are second only by virtue of goal difference.They have conceded just once — in the draw with Liverpool — and in the other three games have scored two or more. And therein lies Chelsea’s fortitude.They have a solid rearguard in place, built around goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, and defenders César Azpilicueta, Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rüdiger, with support down the flanks from Reece James and Marcos Alonso.To spice things up or add a different thrust, German manager Thomas Tuchel turns to Thiago Silva and Benjamin Chilwell.But perhaps more importantly, they now also boast a renewed source for goals in Lukaku.The big Belgian centre-forward has established himself as a top class striker in Europe, having illuminated the Serie A last season and carried that prolific form from Inter Milan to Stamford Bridge. For good measure, he has four goals from four starts for the Blues so far in his second coming at Chelsea.In his first stint as a Chelsea player between 2011 and 2014, during which time he was also loaned out to West Bromwich Albion and Everton, Lukaku only made 10 appearances and without a goal to show for it.He has returned as a genuine threat to all whom they play, and how Man United must be licking their lips.Lukaku joined the Red Devils in 2017 before leaving in 2019 after 66 matches and 28 goals — making nowhere near the sort of impact that was expected after he arrived for an initial £75mil and another £15mil in add-ons.Tottenham will not worry too much about all his history as they fix their attention on trying to thwart his advances on their goal. Given Lukaku’s exploits thus far, Spurs’ best efforts look like they will not be able to keep him out.But the home side have a classy striker of their own, who could well make his presence felt. England captain Harry Kane has the pedigree to unsettle Chelsea and with a bit of good fortune, turn the tables on the more fancied side.Last weekend, Spurs’ talisman was starved of the good service needed upfront to get among the goals against Palace.Earlier this week Tottenham were reportedly considering the inclusion of Argentinians Giovani Lo Celso and Cristian Romero, and Columbia’s Davinson Sanchez in the squad to face Chelsea.The trio is only expected to arrive in London today after spending time in Croatia, training on their own. They travelled to their countries during the international break “without the permission” of their club, and to avoid self-isolation on their return to England, they remained in Croatia since.But with Eric Dier a doubt after an injury at Palace and Japhet Tanganga suspended because of his red card in that game, Nuno will be left with few options.Spurs also have injury concerns over South Korean Heung-min Son and Dutchman Steven Bergwijn.Tottenham will no doubt be keen to give a good account of themselves against one of the contenders of the league title.Failure to do so will not only have Nuno and Co. lose face in a big London derby, but they will also concede more ground in their efforts to mix things with big boys and fight for silverware.\n",

      "(Reuters) - Former England captain David Beckham has increased his ownership stake in Inter Miami, the Major League Soccer (MLS) club said on Friday.Inter Miami, who made their MLS debut last year, said in a news release that co-owners Beckham and brothers Jorge and Jose Mas finalised the buyout of Marcelo Claure and Masayoshi Son.\"We are immensely proud of the progress we've made over the past year and a half in Major League Soccer, and we are grateful to have had Marcelo and Masayoshi with us for the first part of our journey,\" said 46-year-old Beckham.\"I am more committed than ever to working with my partners and friends Jorge and Jose to build a lasting legacy, developing youth players from our Academy, competing for championships regularly, and most importantly, rooting ourselves into the DNA of our community and South Florida.\"Beckham, the former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder, had the right to a discounted MLS franchise as part of the deal which brought him to the league as a player in 2007 when he joined the Los Angeles Galaxy.His arrival in Los Angeles put MLS on the map and brought a level of legitimacy and visibility that otherwise may have taken the North American league decades to reach.Inter Miami made the MLS Cup Playoffs last year and, after a poor start to the current campaign, have found form and are one point outside an Eastern Conference post-season spot with a game in hand.(Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Editing by Ken Ferris)\n",

      "PETALING JAYA: Handling poor results as the leader of a football team is never easy.Sabah’s captain Rawilson Batuil not only knows it but he has done the noble thing by owning up for his lacklustre performance in the Super League.While unhappy with his form, the skipper has promised to lead the team to a better showing in the Malaysia Cup starting on Sept 25.Sabah finished ninth with 19 points, just three points shy of the relegation zone.Their poor outing in the league saw the club rest Indonesian Kurniawan Dwi Yulianto and appoint former national Under-23 coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee as the new head coach.Centreback Rawilson said they should forget about their rough time and look to make amends.“I will be honest...it wasn’t great and satisfying at all. I wasn’t happy with my performance and our outing. We have to bounce back in the Malaysia Cup,” said Rawilson, who has been playing for the club since 2013.“We’ve to do extra work in training to fix our flaws and go in strong. We have a new head coach, and the players are looking forward to re-start again under him.“Kim Swee has coached the national sides and has lots of international experience too. I hope we can adapt to his tactics and do something special.”Rawilson started in 19 Super League games but was part of a porous defence that conceded a whopping 38 goals in 22 matches.It’s the third worst defensive record in the Super League behind relegated Perak and UiTM.He revealed that teamwork needed to be better if they wanted to show their true form and concede fewer goals in the Malaysia Cup.“It is not a great feeling to concede that many goals, and we will remedy it. We hope to toughen up the defence under our new coach.“I will also take my own initiative too to work on some of the flaws we’ve shown this season.”Despite the conundrum in the league, Rawilson believes Sabah have what it takes to shock the odds.Sabah are in Group D with Super League champions Johor Darul Ta’zim, Petaling Jaya City and fourth-placed Premier League team.“Our target, we hope, is to get to the semi-finals. Together, with good harmony and chemistry, we can make it all the way to that stage.”\n",

      "(Reuters) -A resurgent Australia upset South Africa for the second time in a week, storming to an impressive bonus-point 30-17 victory in Brisbane on Saturday to help strip the world champions of their number one ranking.The Wallabies' win left the All Blacks needing a 15-point victory over Argentina to grab top spot, and Ian Foster's men duly delivered in a 36-13 defeat of Argentina in the late match of the double-header at Lang Park. [L1N2QK05U]The All Blacks' fourth successive win in the competition knocked out Australia and Argentina, while South Africa will need to capture big bonus-point wins over the New Zealanders in the last two matches to deny them the silverware.Australia and Argentina's remaining clashes will be dead rubbers but Wallabies fans will be pleased with the improvement shown under coach Dave Rennie.\"I’m really proud of our guys because we wanted to back up last week’s performance with another good one,\" he said.\"A lot of courage tonight and pretty clinical when it counted.”RUNNING GAMEHaving upset the Springboks 28-26 on the Gold Coast on Sunday courtesy of a Quade Cooper penalty after the siren, the Wallabies' running game shone in the Lang Park twilight as centre Len Ikitau and winger Marika Koroibete each scored two tries.Koroibete's second put the Australians 13 points clear with 12 minutes left and the home side defended brilliantly to shut down the contest, winning two turnovers in front of their posts.South Africa managed one try, through centre Lukhanyo Am shortly after halftime, but drew two yellow cards in a flat performance.Following back-to-back drubbings by New Zealand, Australia have clicked into gear with inside centre Samu Kerevi transforming their attack after returning from Japan.They have now risen to third in world rankings.South Africa coach Jacques Nienaber apologised to fans, calling it his side's worst performance since a 32-19 loss to Argentina in Mendoza in 2018.\"We were really beaten. We got hands-down beaten in everything - defence, kicking game, attack,\" he told reporters.\"This isn’t a performance that was worthy enough for (the) Springboks.\"Michael Hooper was at his tireless best as the openside flanker notched up a Wallabies record 60th cap as captain, breaking George Gregan's mark.The only sour point for the hosts was a broken arm for fullback Tom Banks sustained in a tackle with South Africa winger Sbu Nkosi.SCRAPPY STARTSouth Africa were scrappy from the start, and scrumhalf Faf de Klerk was yellow-carded early for slowing the ball in a ruck.Ikitau was quick to capitalise with Australia's first try in the 14th minute, taking a cut-out pass from scrumhalf Nic White to burst through two tacklers in a 10-metre dash.Barnstorming prop Taniela Tupou then crashed through to set up Ikitau's second, with a Koroibete off-load putting the centre over at the right corner.Australia flanker Lachie Swinton was yellow-carded for a high tackle on Duane Vermeulen, and South Africa rallied to a 15-12 deficit at halftime after four penalty goals from Handre Pollard.Two minutes after the restart, the Springboks snatched the lead through Am's try after he ran onto a De Klerk grubber kick at the right corner.Cooper regained the advantage for Australia with a penalty before Koroibete took control with a two-try burst in six minutes.Taking an audacious flick pass from Tupou, Koroibete bolted down the left to cross in the 62nd minute.A Reece Hodge turnover followed by a Kerevi off-load to Pete Samu led to Koroibete's second on the same wing before Australia's defence took over to complete the confidence-building win.(Reporting by Ian Ransom in Melbourne; Editing by David Holmes and Ken Ferris)\n",

      "ISLAMABAD (Reuters) -New Zealand's abrupt decision to pull out of their cricket tour of Pakistan has created \"an unfortunate scenario\" but the hosts know how to overcome such crises, the chairman of the country's cricket board Ramiz Raja said on Saturday.New Zealand abandoned the tour on the day of the opening fixture on Friday citing a government security alert, while England are also reconsidering their men's and women's team visits to Pakistan next month.The tour was due to start with the first of three one-dayers in Rawalpindi but New Zealand did not travel to the stadium.\"It's an unfortunate scenario,\" Raja, who took over as Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman on Monday, said in a video posted on the board's Twitter handle.\"But we've faced similar situations in the past and have always overcome them. We've tremendous resilience... it's a setback to staging international cricket in Pakistan but we'll overcome this crisis too.\"Several Pakistan players took to Twitter to vent their anger and frustration at New Zealand's decision. Raja advised them to channel it into improving their performance.\"My message to the team is -- vent your anger and frustration through your performance on the field.\"If you become the best team in the world, others will queue up here to play you in Pakistan.\"SHOCK ENDLocal media reports said New Zealand would return home on a chartered flight via the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after the shock end to their first Pakistan tour in 18 years.PCB chief executive Wasim Khan was not immediately available to elaborate when Reuters contacted him, while a New Zealand team spokesman declined to share travel plans.Top teams have largely shunned Pakistan in the wake of an attack by Islamist militants on the Sri Lanka team bus in Lahore in 2009 that killed six policemen and two civilians, and there are fears New Zealand's decision to leave will keep them away.England are already reconsidering their limited-overs trip to Pakistan next month while Australia, who are scheduled to visit in February-March next year, also appear wary.A Cricket Australia spokesperson said the organisation was monitoring the situation and would \"talk with the relevant authorities once more information becomes known\".The PCB was already staring at \"financial losses in millions\", the Dawn newspaper said after New Zealand's pullout.\"...this is a blow to the efforts the PCB, the government and the security agencies had been making to fully restore international cricket in Pakistan,\" the Dawn quoted an unidentified PCB official as saying.Pakistan may now have to play 'home' matches again in the United Arab Emirates, with current and former players already dreading that prospect.\"NZ just killed Pakistan cricket,\" tweeted former test bowler Shoaib Akhtar.Pace bowler Mohammad Amir also criticised New Zealand in a tweet for abandoning the tour: \"hi new Zealand might b we as a Pakistani will forgive u because we are a loving nation but this act will bite u in future for sure.\"(Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi and Ian Ransom in Melbourne; editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Ken Ferris)\n",

      "HOTELS and restaurants that heavily relied on dine-in and walk-in customers prior to the Covid-19 pandemic have had to restrategise to sell their mooncakes.Since movement restrictions have curtailed the usual way of selling, and with mall events also curbed, food and beverage (F&B) businesses have had to adapt in order to market these festive creations.StarMetro speaks to several established ventures to find out how they have pivoted, ahead of the Mid-Autumn Festival on Sept 21.Adopting dining concierge serviceThe Oriental Group believes that regular communication with customers is key to sustaining its business.“We reach out to customers through our loyalty programme, the Cuisine Club, via electronic messaging services,” said The Oriental Group operations general manager (external affairs) Lyn Siew.“To keep our customers engaged, we churn out new menus and promotional items fortnightly, almost like clockwork.“We also offer something similar to a dining concierge service, whereby customers can contact our outlet managers to tailor orders to their requirements.“We aim to provide customers peace of mind when it comes to food preparation and delivery, which adhere to the highest hygiene and safety standards,” she added.The group also works closely with its mall landlords to leverage on their respective databases in marketing its takeaway promotions.“Whenever movement restrictions were enforced, we pivoted 50% of our takeaway sales to online platforms through our own and other third-party e-commerce platforms,” said Siew.“The remaining 50% is restaurant- based through our in-house teams, as we still prioritise serving our customers directly.“This human touch, despite the pandemic, remains a core principle as we still value direct relationships with our customers,” she said.Despite dine-in restrictions last year, Siew said the group recorded a boost in mooncake sales, as they were generally regarded as takeaway or gifting items.She is optimistic about seeing a similar boost this year.“The Mid-Autumn Festival is observed by the Chinese community annually.“This is the main reason we expanded our mooncake range this year to have new and relevant products so customers have more choices,” she explained.The group added four new flavours this year – including the Custard Durian Snow Skin and Ying Yang Red Bean Snow Skin – to complement its existing range of four popular flavours that includes Yam Paste Teochew Style and Shanghai Style.On the packaging, Siew said the quality of boxes were maintained but the design and colours were “elevated to a modern abstract direction”.“We did not impose any premium pricing this year, taking into consideration the general consumer spending during current economic circumstances.“Consistent flavour and quality remain our priority.“Our mooncakes are freshly prepared in our kitchens with no preservatives,” she stressed.Keeping to only bestsellers and limiting production amountGrand Imperial Group business development manager Maggie Chow said the restaurant decided to only offer its top-selling mooncakes which customers look forward to every year.“Mid-Autumn is an important festival among the Chinese, who buy mooncakes as gifts.“Some even enjoy mooncakes in the month leading up to the festival day.“But since we were not allowed to have booths at malls during earlier lockdowns, this affected our sales.“So we decided to limit our mooncake selections, leaving out snow skin versions as they have a shorter shelf life,” she explained.The group produced four traditional baked mooncake flavours this year – Single Yolk White Lotus Paste, Single Yolk Pandan Lotus Paste, Double Yolk Lotus Paste and Red Bean Paste with Citrus.By limiting the flavours, Chow said the group was able to ensure that only the best of its mooncakes were produced.“We made about 500 mooncakes a day and only made more when those ran out.“So customers were always assured of the freshest products, both low in sugar and using premium quality ingredients,” she said.“If there were a lot of orders, our chefs would adjust production accordingly.“We also retained last year’s classy wooden mooncake box design as it was popular with customers,” she added.Additionally, the group took a fresh approach in reaching out to customers through regular livestreaming sessions, said Chow.“During the livestream, we also update customers on our new products, meals and dim sum packages.”Thanks to support from its customers and the group’s strategic planning, she said its mooncakes for this year were already sold out.Investing in online presence and product made for takeawayVanilla Crepe founder and chief executive officer Nelson Liew said the company had always dedicated significant budget and effort into solidifying its presence online, hence it was not badly affected by dine-in restrictions.“The business has never relied heavily on dine-in or events as our products are mostly take-home treats for the family.“The ‘moon crepe’ (what the company calls its mooncakes) business is also one which is gifted to family and friends and can be delivered, so that is a big help,” he highlighted.He said their “moon crepe” business was also one driven by Internet eyeballs and word of mouth.“We made some minor adjustments in our marketing approach this year by investing more into making sure our products were visible online and beautifully presented.“This included engaging high-end photography and videography services plus investing in online promotions.“The opportunity lost from not having booths at malls was translated into more shoutouts online to garner a similar response from the public,” he added.Vanilla Crepe’s “moon crepe” flavours this year include bestsellers Rainbow and Mango Peach as well as new flavours KitKat and Jobbie Nut Butter, which have been created in collaboration with Nestle and Jobbie.In terms of packaging, there are two types.“The luxury box caters to a slightly higher-income group who is willing to spend for special occasions,” said Liew.“The lite box is a more economical option for those on a budget.”He expects the Mooncake Festival to provide a boost to Vanille Crepe, which has 30 stores in Malaysia.This year, the company’s moon crepes are also available in Sabah and Sarawak as well as Singapore and Hong Kong.Creating meaningful packaging and better delivery optionsSt Regis Kuala Lumpur general manager Renato De Oliveira said the Covid-19 situation challenged his team to deliver the same St Regis experience to guests in their homes.“We did this by creating exceptional takeaway and delivery options, such as using beautiful packaging for our classic afternoon tea set to recreate the elegant three-tier stand.“We also created cooking kits accompanied by QR codes with instructions and personalised videos from our chefs.“There were classic cocktail kits with masterclass sessions as well, so guests could recreate their favourite meals and drinks at home,” he elaborated.De Oliveira shared that online platforms played an important role in ensuring that all of the hotel’s products and experiences were well-communicated and promoted.“We use those platforms to promote our mooncakes and share the story behind the mooncake trunks (packaging),” he said, crediting his marketing team for the e-content that reflects the efforts and passion behind the hotel’s products.“Our faux-leather mooncake trunks take inspiration from the Astor family’s love for travel, and we are thrilled to unveil a new version every year.“This year, we paid homage to our founder John Jacob Astor IV’s exquisite penmanship during his many voyages and his travelling stationery trunk.”On the mooncake flavours, De Oliveira said St Regis Kuala Lumpur took pride in maintaining its traditional flavour – white lotus seed paste – in two sizes.The Mooncake Festival has always brought in very strong demand, and De Oliveira believes this year will be no different.“As current restrictions don’t allow a large-scale celebration, people are choosing to show their love and care by gifting their loved ones with mooncakes,” he said.Focus on domestic market and drive-through convenienceHilton regional general manager (Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam) Jamie A. Mead said the hotel had revised its customer marketing strategy by putting greater focus on the domestic audience and spending more on online media.“Our distribution model has been evolving towards the online space over the past four years.“However, within the Covid-19 period, this has rapidly skewed the percentages towards e-commerce or online dependency, both on owned and third-party channels,” he said.Hilton Kuala Lumpur also had to adopt new processes to promote and sell its mooncakes.“In the past, we would have relied on sales through our own mooncake boutique in the lobby area.“But we have had to evolve our approach by catering to the local market this year.“This was done by embracing delivery services and opening our first drive-through mooncake outlet in the lobby drop-off area of Hilton Kuala Lumpur’s main entrance,” said Mead.On packaging, the hotel continues with its strategy of offering a new premium mooncake box of high quality and finish.This year’s highlight is the Jade Moon gift box, featuring a ceramic tea set and Chynna Restaurant’s signature Eight Treasures Tea with a choice of traditional baked or snow skin mooncakes.“We have retained our bestselling mooncakes from previous years, such as the Heavenly Gold Durian Snow Skin Mooncake,” said Mead.“The signature mooncake this year is the Royal Jade Snow Skin Mooncake, containing a white lotus paste and salted mung bean filling, contrasted with crunchy cashew nut nibs.”He said the Mooncake Festival had always provided a boost in business.“With consumers being more mindful of their spending this year, there appears to be greater demand for products like the mooncake box, which is convenience for both collection and delivery,” he added.\n",

      "Penang House of Music’s (PHoM) efforts to safeguard the musical, artistic and cultural heritage of the state and country have caught the eye of foreign organisations.Besides generating publicity, the recognition also led to invitations for PHoM founder and director Paul Augustin to speak at two major international virtual conferences.He was a panellist in a discussion held as part of Unesco Bangkok’s launch of its ‘Backstage: Managing Creativity and the Arts in Southeast Asia’ report and a book titled ‘Re-imagining Creative Cities in Twenty-First Century Asia’.Held on Aug 14, the event highlighted the challenges faced by creative industry organisations in the Covid-19 pandemic plus the key differentiators that allow some to be successful.Next up, Augustin will be a keynote speaker at the International Association for Sound and Audiovisual Archives 2021 Conference from Sept 27 to 30.He will give a 40-minute presentation on PHoM’s journey and take part in a 20-minute Q&A session.“These invitations are great opportunities not only for the PHoM team and me but also for Penang and Malaysia to be recognised internationally for efforts in preserving intangible heritage like music and the arts.“It is something we’re passionate about and it shows that what we do makes a difference and is appreciated,” Augustin said.Looking back to November 2016 when PHoM first opened, he said it had been a tough journey but also an exciting one filled with discoveries.“People often don’t realise the huge impact that music has on their everyday lives.“Music evokes emotions. When you’re happy, you sing a happy song. When you’re sad, you listen to a sad song and it can make you feel better!“It has the power to influence moods, motivate or inspire. Just imagine a world without music. It would be devoid of life and soul,” Augustin added.\n",

      "DRIVEN by the desire to assist the less privileged, a group of like-minded entrepreneurs and business owners have come together to form the Malaysian Social Entrepreneurs Foundation (MSEF).Established in April 2021, the foundation focuses on three main areas, namely educational support, developing well-rounded social leaders to implement and improve public welfare and helping the disadvantaged.MSEF president Datuk Seri Lee Kar Whatt said the foundation’s efforts and plans actually began about one and a half years before its establishment.“One of our intentions was to influence enterprises to come together to unite our resources and strengths to assist the community and B40 groups through targeted initiatives. All they have to do is set aside a portion of their profits to contribute to the foundation.“We have raised approximately RM30mil so far, where about RM10mil have been used for various initiatives such as free meals distribution, medical equipment contribution to hospitals and educational support for students.“We have a shared responsibility to look out for the community and lend a helping hand to those in need,” he said in an interview.Lee added that the foundation hopes that those who benefitted from their programmes to pay it forward and do some good for the community as well.The foundation’s deputy president, Datuk Chan Wah Kiang, said since starting their free meals distribution programme on July 29, more than one million of mainly halal packs of free food have been given out to the needy.“With the help of about 100 volunteers, the free meals were distributed at 130 locations nationwide for lunch and dinner to ensure that the less privileged, those home quarantined and those who lost their jobs will not go hungry.“When the programme first started, most of the food packs were snapped up within 30 minutes, which led us to increase the quantities to feed more people,” he shared, adding that MSEF plans to continue the food distribution programme nationwide until the end of September.However, for certain identified locations, such as places that still have a low vaccination rate, the free food giveaway programme will continue until the allocated funds have been fully utilised.“Through this initiative, we also came into contact with various old folks’ and children’s homes and realised that they faced financial issues due to the lack of donations during the pandemic.“As such, we decided to channel RM300,000 to 32 charity and welfare homes throughout the country to help them get by,” he added.Besides that, Chan noted that MSEF also contributed RM1.85mil worth of oxygen concentrators, consumables and other medical equipment to 10 hospitals, especially those handling daily Covid-19 cases, throughout the country.Touching on the foundation’s top priorities, MSEF executive director Aki Chong Li Chin said last year, the junior chef programme was introduced in two primary schools in Jementah, Segamat for students to learn new skills through cooking.She explains, “MSEF emphasises the importance of education to build a better future for our children and country, which is why we placed education support at the top of our focus areas.“In the junior chef programme, the students explore new things through food preparation, which makes learning a more fun and enjoyable process.“After the programme, we realised that the students also picked up good values such as gratitude, taking the initiative to help out more at home as well as appreciation for their parents.”Chong added that these positive qualities could change a child’s outlook in life as well, noting that MSEF hopes that the beneficial programme could be introduced to more schools soon to enable students to discover their hidden talents.On the topic of education, she said the foundation also aims to continue offering scholarships and education loans to students in need, as well as assist schools to improve their libraries and their gradual digitisation journey through long-term projects.Meanwhile, the foundation’s vice-president Datuk Nelson Tan said MSEF, along with Eco-Shop Malaysia Sdn Bhd and private equity firm Creador, has donated RM6mil to help 6,000 Chinese independent school students with unpaid school fees.He pointed out that the pandemic has impacted many families, with parents facing pay cuts and job losses, which affected their ability to pay for their children’s school fees.“At the same time, schools were also struggling to pay the teachers’ salaries and administrative expenses.“In order to assist them, we decided to jointly channel RM6mil so RM1,000 will be allocated to each of the 6,000 students,” he said.Tan said the foundation also thanked Eco-Shop, whose managing director is also MSEF president, as well as Creador founder Brahmal Vasudevan for their generosity.MSEF encourages more enterprises and business owners to join them in their efforts to spread positivity and assist needy communities.For more information, visit msef.com.my or fb.com/my.msef, get in touch with them via email at my.msef@gmail.com or call 011-5880 5897, or scan the QR code.\n",

      "SELANGOR folk planning an outing to riversides and waterfalls in forest reserve areas should cancel their plans as authorities in the state have warned that such places are currently off limits.State Forestry Department director Datuk Ahmad Fadzil Abd Majid said the police would issue compounds to errant individuals found engaging in leisure activities at such places.“The issue is not about needing a permit or being fully vaccinated, as all recreational venues in forest reserves are currently closed.“Members of the public who are found in such areas will be asked to leave immediately.“This directive will remain in effect until further notice,” he told StarMetro.Earlier this week, photos and videos on social media showed crowds of people bathing without minding physical distancing rules at Sungai Pisang located within the Gombak Forest Reserve.Many sightseers have been visiting riversides to picnic and enjoy recreation time with family and friends ever since Klang Valley entered Phase Two of the National Recovery Plan recently.A guideline, released on Sept 9 by National Security Council for states under Phase Two, says picnicking is allowed for fully-vaccinated individuals. They can also bring along children under 17, albeit with strict compliance with the usual standard operating procedures.Central Selangor district forestry officer Khairul Nizam Mohamed told a news portal that the guideline did not include areas in forest reserves.The police, alongside officers from the Forestry Department, Selayang Municipal Council (MPS) and district health office conducted an operation at Sungai Pisang last Thursday.They found 50 visitors there, some of whom had pitched a tent to rest after partaking in outdoor activities.Ahmad Fadzil said further checks found that all the visitors were fully vaccinated, but they were told to leave. No compound was issued.MPS Corporate Department deputy director Ahmad Fauzi Ishak said the council only assisted in the operation, and that the authority to issue compounds was with the police and Health Department.Meanwhile, netizens raised concerns about visitors who had discarded their plastic waste and paper wrappings in the area, including in the river itself.Fadzil Akmar commented on Facebook that visitors should take their rubbish home to be disposed of properly, and that people should behave responsibly to ensure public places were kept clean, especially sites near water sources.Nur Anisah Abdullah said poor hygiene attitudes revealed the mentality of the litterbugs, and urged authorities to be stern by issuing fines.\n",

      "THE southwest district of Penang where tourists would usually visit to get up close with nature and the local community is not drawing in visitors despite homestays now allowed to open.Teluk Bahang Homestay manager Rozita Omar, who oversees 11 homestay units near the Penang National Park, said since reopening two weeks ago, there had been no bookings.“We are offering a 20% discount off the usual rates and each stay comes with free breakfast.“Four of our units are private rooms with their own entrance while seven other units are within the same house.“Although some tourist attractions here are still closed, visitors can relax within the quiet neighbourhood next to the beach.“Villagers here are ready to assist in all their needs and for them to learn more about us,” she said.Rozita said stricter standard operating procedures (SOP) for the homestays were introduced to instil confidence among guests such as frequent sanitising of the rooms and limiting the number of guests to each room.“No more crowding is allowed and the number of guests allowed for each room is according to its size and number of beds,” she said.Despite poor response from visitors, she was grateful to be allowed to reopen.“Our guests are usually made up of 40% foreign tourists and 60% locals from other states.“Hopefully locals living here would support us as their stay would mean added income for villagers.“Many of us here who help out to clean and manage the homestays are housewives whose husbands are low-income earners such as fishermen,” she said.Over at Pulau Betong, Desa Lestari Homestay Pulau Betong chairman Amir Yusoff said the homestay operators there decided to remain closed until Covid-19 tapers off.“All 11 homestay units sharing with families and 10 homestay units of individual houses have remained closed since March last year.“The high number of Covid-19 cases is the main concern for us to remain closed although it is a big burden to maintain the properties after almost two years.“The surroundings need to be cleaned frequently and buildings need to be kept in good order as they’re part of the village we live in,” he said.Amir said to prevent further losses, some owners temporarily turned their homestay units into rented houses.“We used to charge guests RM90 per person which includes a welcoming ceremony and at least four meals daily.“They get to experience our lifestyle and we would receive an average of nine days of occupancy every month before the movement control order (MCO) came into effect.“Private houses are rented at a charge of between RM150 and RM450 per night.“Without this income during the pandemic, owners suffer a huge loss of income,” he said.The community however plans to revive the homestay business once the pandemic eases.“We will offer durian season promotions as the village is surrounded by durian orchards.“Events such as cycling and traditional bazaars will be held to attract urbanites seeking relief away from the hustle and bustle of city life,” he said.Among the homestay operators who chose to remain closed is retired teacher Rosle Othman, 59, who had spent RM60,000 to build a twin homestay unit behind his house.“Many customers have called to book but I am reluctant.“As this is a bonus income for me, safety of other villagers and my family is of utmost priority at the moment.“Without the income, we just have to spend wisely.“When I reopen, we will filter our guests and interview them before approving their bookings,” he said.The Government had announced that tourism activities involving homestays and hotels within the same state for those fully vaccinated is allowed for states under Phase Two and beyond of the National Recovery Plan.\n",

      "MOTORISTS who commute regularly along Jalan Sungai Kapar Indah in Klang have to endure nerve-racking drives as they attempt to evade crater-like potholes on the badly damaged asphalt road.This perilous 230m stretch is after the turn-off from Lorong Sungai Puloh, up until the junction outside Jalan Wawasan 3/Ku7.For almost 10 months now, road users have to proceed with extreme caution over this stretch as they negotiate the multiple potholes, which can measure from 3.2m to 4.1m in width.Such hazards scrape the front bumper of vehicles, as car wheels dip into the ever-widening holes.Motorcyclists have been exposed to serious danger, with some falling off their machines.The affected motorists and residents said complaints to Klang Municipal Council (MPK) had fallen on deaf ears.Osman Jalil, 58, drives his 15-year-old vehicle on Jalan Sungai Kapar Indah daily to work at a light industrial plant.Driving on the affected stretch has taken a chunk out of his wallet in repairs for damaged rims and the steering.“I dread going on that stretch of the road.“I see many motorists trying to avoid the potholes and driving at an extremely slow pace to avoid damaging their cars, but this itself causes the risk of an accident with vehicles behind them,” he said.Osman, a father of five, added that he had seen motorcyclists flung off their machines after hitting a pothole, with some having to be admitted to hospital.Another motorist, Mok Soon Chet said the badly damaged part of Jalan Sungai Kapar Indah must be fixed urgently.“It is perilous as cars run into the crater-like potholes that at times are not obvious because they are filled with rainwater.“Some cars have had their side skirting or bumpers fall off after going through the potholes.“Other cars’ alignment and suspensions are affected. Those also negatively impact on their tyres’ wear and tear,” he said.Mok said road users were deeply disappointed with MPK for dragging its feet in addressing the pothole problem.“It is an important and busy stretch because there are numerous businesses in the area.“People want to get to their workplace safely,” he added.Accountant Kamariah Daud urged MPK to solve the problem soon.“Our workers are frustrated over this menace,” she said, noting that whatever method the council used in repairing the road before was ineffective.“MPK needs to reconstruct the road with high quality materials to withstand the weight of hundreds of heavy vehicles that use Jalan Sungai Kapar Indah daily,” she said.Kamariah added that the large potholes along Jalan Wawasan 3/Ku7 must also be addressed.On another issue, Human Resources manager Haslinah Mahmud wants MPK’s Environmental Services Department to desilt the 1.5m-wide drains at Jalan Wawasan 3/Ku7 and along the stretch of Jalan Sungai Kapar Indah that are choked with mud, litter and grass.“We also want MPK to clean up the illegal dumpsite across Jalan Wawasan 3/Ku7,” she said.\n",

Penang youth and sports committee chairman Soon Lip Chee said he hoped gyms would be able to operate again by the end of the year.\n",

      "Metro\n",
      "RSN MURALI: CITYCISM\n",
      "THERE has been an increase in the number of feral cats in Melaka city in recent months.Some may ask why I have chosen the word “feral” and not “stray”.Well, strays are defined as domesticated felines that have strayed away from their homes while feral cats are animals with no owners.One animal lover from Banda Hilir shared his thoughts on feral cats after observing them for close to a year.The animal lover, Billy, said stray cats relied on humans for food and shelter while feral felines were independent and capable of surviving on their own.Feral cats, he said, would hunt lizards, frogs and insects and some go to rubbish dumps in search of food.According to Billy, ethologists, too have studied the behaviour of feral cats in an urban area.These cats, he said, had the tendency to shy away when humans approach them but there was also the possibility of them pouncing on strangers.Billy said that feral cats looked healthier and cleaner as they were capable of grooming themselves and are much more resilient compared to strays.However, feral cats tend to have low-life expectancy as they are easily preyed upon by civet cats and dogs.Concerns have been also shared by residents on feral cats transmitting diseases to pets, especially female cats.Melaka agriculture, agro-based, entrepreneur development and cooperative committee chairman Datuk Norhizam Hassan Baktee said the abandonment of domesticated cats as well as strays has led to an increase in their population.“We don’t have any facts on feral or stray felines as a study has not been done on them.“Besides, it’s difficult to distinguish between a stray and a feral cat, but I will ask the state Veterinary Services Department to identify locations where these cats are found,” he said, adding that this could be an interesting subject to explore.Norhizam said that so far, there were no reports of people being attacked or hurt by strays or feral cats in Melaka.He said that people should be kinder to these animals and that trapping them was not a good idea.Strays and feral cats, he said, could warm up to people if they knew they would not be harmed.He also voiced concern that these cats could die from consuming sharp and indigestible items from food waste in rubbish bins.Feral cats are a common sight in Ujong Pasir, Bukit Beruang, Cheng and as far as Tanjung Minyak, especially at night as they are nocturnal creatures.The presence of these cats was especially noticeable during lockdown periods as people spent more time at home.Sadly, some feral cats have had the same fate as displaced macaques and wild boars.In fact, the welfare of feral cats as well as other wild animals should be looked into.We should take a leaf from Istanbul, Turkey which hosts a sizeable number of feral cats that are cared for by the community as they are regarded as communally-owned pets.Efforts are also made by various parties to get street cats sterilised.Animal rights is of significance in Turkey and lawmakers there are looking into stricter punishment to deal with animal cruelty.Perhaps, we can learn a thing or two from Turkey, where people treat animals as living beings instead of looking at them as a nuisance.By doing so, we can help street cats survive.\n",

      "First, she was a survivor: #MeToo’s Tarana Burke tells her story\n",
      "Lifestyle\n",
      "AGENCY\n",
      "“Maybe it won’t catch on.”That’s what Tarana Burke was thinking — indeed, hoping — when she first found out the phrase “MeToo” was suddenly circulating online in October 2017, in the wake of shocking revelations about Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.It was a phrase she had come up with over years of working with survivors of sexual violence. And she worried that it would be co-opted or misused, turned into a mere hashtag for a brief moment of social media frenzy and ruining the hard work she had done.As it turned out, it did catch on. Actor Alyssa Milano had asked victims of sexual assault or harassment to share their stories or simply say #MeToo, and hundreds of thousands had done so on the very first day. But Burke’s fears did not materialise, and her movement has taken off in a way she’d never dreamed.“I wasn’t even dreaming this big,” she said in an interview. “I thought I had big, lofty goals and I didn’t dream nearly big enough.”Now, as the #MeToo movement — the social reckoning that began in 2017 — approaches its fourth anniversary, Burke, 48, has come out with a highly personal, often raw memoir of her childhood in the Bronx in New York City, her journey into activism, and the beginnings of #MeToo. She also provides a vivid account of how she herself was raped when she was only seven years old — an event that shaped her future in profound ways.Q: Why was it time for this memoir?Burke: People will think this is a book about, you know, going to the Golden Globes and meeting a bunch of celebrities, and a bunch of powerful men whose lives were impacted by #MeToo. I want to tell a different story. My story is ordinary and also extraordinary: It’s so many other little black girls’ stories, so many young women’s stories. We don’t pay attention to the nuances of what survival looks like or what sexual violence feels like and how it impacts our lives. So it just felt important. This is a story that’s been growing inside me for more than 40 years. It was time to give it a home outside of my body.What message do you hope to send other women and girls who, like you, experienced rape or sexual assault?That their experiences aren’t singular, and they aren’t alone. It feels really isolating, particularly if you’re dealing with sexual violence. I really want to convey the message that you are not alone. YOU are normal and the things that happened to you are NOT normal. It doesn’t make something wrong with you.You write about how you felt both guilt deep shame about what happened to you.Shame is insidious. It’s all-consuming. It can get into all the nooks and crannies and cracks and crevices of your life. There’s not enough messages that say, ‘This is not your shame to carry. This is not your burden to bear.’A key issue moving forward is the intersection of #MeToo and race. Have we moved forward as a society in that regard?We haven’t moved nearly enough. It became even more evident during the racial reckoning the country found itself in the last year or so. People cannot connect the two. Really, this is about advancing humanity. All of it is about liberation. And so Black lives have to matter. Women, people, have to have bodily autonomy. We need to live in a world that thinks about the environment and the actual space that we live in. All of those things are related to how we coexist as human beings. And we have to recognise that these systems of oppression we all live under affect us differently. I am Black and I am a woman and I am a survivor. And all those things exist at the same time.A very raw part of this book explores how when you were young, you felt ugly. You had to navigate those feelings. Did this experience help you to parent your own child?I was very worried about Kaia’s self-esteem. But then Kaia turned out to be this beautiful child, a physically beautiful child. And still in middle school she came to me and said, ‘I want Hannah Montana’s nose,’ and things like, kids were bothering them because they thought they were ugly. And I was just like, wow, it doesn’t matter what you physically look like. People will find ways to to tear you down. If they see the vulnerability and and parts of you that shine, they’ll take the lowest hanging fruit and try to take that from you.You describe how when #MeToo exploded in 2017, you were so afraid your movement, the work you’d done, would be co-opted. How did you get over that concern?Over time it became clear to me that whatever I’m supposed to do, whatever this assignment is that I’ve been given, it’s clearly an assignment for ME. And so if you take away how the world or the media describes #MeToo, what I built hasn’t really changed. I say this in the book: little Black girls in Selma and white women in Hollywood really need the same things. And I realised, nobody can take that away from me. I just became really comfortable. It may not ever look like it looked in October 2017. But that’s OK, because what happened in October 2017 was a phenomenal moment that we shouldn’t be trying to duplicate. We should be trying to build on that and do other things. So I don’t have that fear anymore. And it’s been an incredible journey of learning. — AP\n",

      "It is not easy to parent a child with learning disabilities as a lot of patience and forbearance may be needed.Developmental and behavioural paediatrician Dr Cindy Chan offers some tips for parents with such children:> Be mindful of your languageHold it in and avoid negative words (e.g. lazy, stupid, etc.) when discussing her performance or attitude.A learning disability means difficulties in grasping conventional academic approaches.To cope, she often needs a different approach to teaching and should be given more time to practice and master the skills taught.> Know your child’s limitationsFocus on his strengths, while finding specific ways to enable him to input and output his learning.For example, children with dysgraphia have trouble writing.Seek to provide appropriate support like occupational therapy to improve eye-hand coordination and requesting permission from the school for your child to use a laptop to type notes in class.> Temper your expectationsAs parents, always remember that every child is different.Some children handle frustration and setbacks better than others, so tailor your expectations and responses according to her learning profile and abilities.Set the bar just high enough to challenge her, but not too high that it becomes unattainable.Knowing and understanding her personality makes it easier for you to motivate her to do her best.> Involve your child in some decision-makingThis is a shared journey that requires two-way conversations with your child.Encourage him to also come up with ideas or strategies he may want to try.This is an important aspect of learning: making mistakes and learning what works for himself.> Remember that the process is more important than the outcomeGive honest and specific praise whenever she puts in good effort and perseveres.Don’t just look at exam results; be supportive of interests outside academics.Apart from music, arts or sports, think about providing opportunities and experiences that may shape ideas for innovative employment opportunities for your child in the future, such as a passion for environmental sustainability, animal care and digital content creation, to name a few.> Manage unwanted behaviourLearn appropriate strategies to manage negative behaviours.Having good communication with your child will enable you to adjust his learning environment to be more effective and less stressful.This article is courtesy of the Malaysian Paediatric Association’s Positive Parenting programme in collaboration with expert partners.

      "If anyone doesn't need reminding that banknotes are just worthless pieces of paper, it is Zimbabweans: more than a decade ago, they watched as hyperinflation obliterated their currency and led to the printing of a 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollar note.Zim dollars were abandoned in 2009, after inflation caused by rampant money printing under the late President Robert Mugabe erased everyone's savings and pushed millions into poverty.Most bills ended up in the trash, but Zimbabwean visual artist Prudence Chimutuwah has found value in the unloved old bank notes - by using them to make art.Chimutuwah wants Zimbabweans to look beyond the ugly history of the inflation - considered by the International Monetary Fund as the worst of any peacetime country - to see something beautiful in the bills. And, in the process, perhaps recover from the trauma of that time.\"A lot of people, when they see the old bank notes, their reaction most of the time (is to) get angry,\" said Chimutuwah.\"I am trying... for people to see the beauty of these old bank notes. So, when someone looks at this artwork they go like 'whoa' and then they forget the pain this thing has caused.\"Her paintings capture the daily lives of women, shown dancing, cooking or in bright and elegant dress, with the old Zim dollar notes stuck on with glue to form part of the image.Her figures are mostly blue, which she described as \"a symbol of strength and dominance\".In one painting, a woman pours a liquid from a calabash, which is made up of pieces of brown 1,000 and 50 billion Zimbabwe dollar notes. In another, a woman wears a mask and blouse made from purple 500 million Zimbabwe dollar notes. - Reuters\n",

      "If you love to hunt, chances are you’ve hunted with dogs before and have perhaps considered investing in your own as well. This is especially true if you love hunting waterfowl, wildboar, or squirrel. But you probably don’t want to have a dog that has to be kennelled at all times and is at high risk for running off on their own. Rather, you want a dog that makes a good pet as well, and is a constant companion.Most dog breeds have hunting in their bloodline somewhere but not all dogs make good hunting dogs, and not all hunting dogs make good companion dogs. You want to look for a breed that is both loyal and willing to follow directions, as well as have a prey drive for usefulness in the field. Take a look below at some of the best breeds for this purpose.What to look for in a hunting dogWhen you are looking for a dog that you can use as both a great hunting dog and as a good house pet, you want to think about the purpose of a hunting dog first, and then look for those traits that provide the loyalty and love you are seeking in a pet.First off, you need to provide professional training to your pet. The dog needs to know how to listen well and follow commands to help overcome their high prey and hunting skill drive. This training will also make them a calmer, more conducive pet for the home.Most hunting dogs fall into one of four types of categories: scent hounds, pointers and setters, flushing dogs, and retrievers. All can make excellent pets as well as become expert at their jobs in the field. Your responsibility is to provide consistency through training to make it happen.Hunting dog historyHumans have been fascinated with dogs for approximately 20,000 years, and have used them as domesticated companions for hunting and protection in a manner that has benefited both species. Today, there are more than 30 recognized hunting breeds out of almost 200 breeds overall, making up a huge part of why people still pick hunting dogs today.A good dog can serve as a guard animal, pack animal, companion, and provide hunting benefits. With selective breeding spanning back 9,000 years, it isn’t odd to assume that humans quickly learned to watch for specific traits for specific needs.Hunting dogs today can: Track and hunt animals; find wounded game; scent and flush (the dog searches your surrounding area, and is able to quickly get any animal, like birds, out of hiding and up into the air); and retrieve downed game from a variety of situations.We’ve compiled the top seven hunting dog breeds that are also considered beloved house pets as well. These pups do require time and care for them to reach their full potential, but all are amazing companions.1. Labrador RetrieverBred for water retrieving, the Labrador Retriever has become a favourite household breed that exhibits a gentle, protective nature with children and showcases a high intelligence. Still popular in hunting trials, the Lab is a loyal option that will work by your side both day and night.2. GoldendoodleThis crossbred, designed breed brings the best of the Standard Poodle and Golden Retriever together to create a hypoallergenic, non-shedding dog that excels both in the home with children and in the field working as a hunting dog. Incredibly affectionate, they are easy to train and make a great companion.3. Golden RetrieverIt’s quite possible there are more Golden Retrievers getting fat as family dogs than being hunted with, but this docile, gentle breed is incredibly loyal, intelligent, and bred for competitive retrieving. Because of this, they are an amazing choice for families with children.4. German Shorthaired PointerPopular as a family pet, the German Shorthaired Pointer is an intelligent and playful breed that will work all day pointing and flushing, and curl up and protect your family all night. Their high energy is part of their genetics to help them keep going in the field, but it also allows them to be a wonderful running and walking companion.5. Brittany SpanielEager to please, the Brittany Spaniel is known for their excellent bird-hunting skills and is widely used in highly competitive shooting trials. This loyalty pays off in other arenas as well, and helps them be an amazing companion animal that is highly intelligent and always looking for ways to please their families. Just be aware they have a lot of energy and want to be by your side at all times.6. WeimaranerLoyal, friendly, and great with children, this sleek, shorthaired dog is known for its goofy personality and silver grey coat. Perfect for all around hunting options, they are amazingly intelligent and have a ton of energy that you can focus through consistent training.7. Jack Russell TerrierFriendly, playful, and pint-sized, the Jack Russell Terrier is easy to train and work with, but does have a lot of energy that needs to be directed towards a purpose. Incredibly intelligent, they learn fast and are great for both tracking and varmint-hunting, and have made their mark in fox-hunting as well.ConclusionChoosing a dog breed for both hunting purposes and as a companion is not too hard to do when such awesome breeds exist. These are only a few of the best, but they are excellent companions and make amazing family dogs.Curtis Lawson makes his home in Florida, the United States. Along with shooting sports, he and his family also participate in other outdoor activities, such as boating and fishing.\n",

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "CHESTER CHIN\n",
      "The Langkawi tourism bubble will surely provide a much needed respite for Malaysians who are keen to pursue their wanderlust again after months of travel restrictions.One such person is K. Aruna who immediately looked up travel booking platforms after it was announced that the tourism pilot project has been given the green light.“Before the pandemic, I would take two weeks off in a year to travel to some place new. Now, I’m grateful if I get to travel anywhere at all, even if it’s a domestic destination that I have been to before,” she said, adding that her last trip to Langkawi was in 2017.The sales executive said she has been keeping a close tab on the tourism bubble news since it was first mentioned last month. She is glad the government decided to go ahead with the initiative.ALSO READ: Time to focus on Malaysian healthcare travellers amid the pandemicWhile Aruna is excited to travel again, she only plans to go to Langkawi in either November or December.“I’m waiting for the hype to die down first. I’m sure many people will be visiting the island in the first few months and many places (of attraction) would be packed,” she said.It’s worth noting that tourists who are planning to travel by land would need to to use the services of travel agencies.“They will need to at least use the transport services provided by travel agencies from their respective starting destination to the jetty in Langkawi,” said Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri during a press conference.She added that travel agencies will help tourists to apply for permit from the police to travel to Langkawi.Meanwhile, Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin recently clarified that tourists flying into Langkawi will not need a police permit.“For the Langkawi pilot tourism programme ‘travel bubble’, a letter from the police was only for the purpose of interstate travel and roadblocks if they are travelling by land,” he tweeted.On social media, Twitter user Freyr hopes the tourism bubble will breathe new life to Langkawi’s ecotourism attractions.“Saw that a lot of people are planning to go to Langkawi. Please visit ecotourism places like Kilim Geoforest Park, Machinchang Cambrian Geoforest Park and the Dayang Bunting Marble Geoforest Park.“By going to these places, you would be supporting conservation and communities,” he tweeted.That being said, the Langkawi tourism bubble has also courted some mixed reactions on social media.“I can’t visit my parents in Negri Sembilan but I can go holiday in Langkawi? Is this a joke? Make it make sense,” said Sharifah Hani Yasmin on Twitter.She subsequently suggested that she might just book a trip to Langkawi for her parents so that the family could reunite there.Some travel stakeholders have admitted that the tourism bubble will not be a foolproof plan. The project is not meant to guarantee zero Covid-19 cases, said Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) chief executive officer Yap Lip Seng.“We have learnt from other similar initiatives such as the Phuket Sandbox (in Thailand), and it is crucial to understand that the initiative is not meant to be foolproof – it is not meant to be perfect.“It will not guarantee zero Covid-19 cases (whether in or out), but what it is, instead, is an exit plan to live with Covid-19, having understood that it will not go away,” said Yap in an interview.Meanwhile, housewife Mary Kwan is less than thrilled about the tourism bubble in Langkawi.“A holiday is the last thing on my family’s mind now. We are still seeing so many cases reported daily,” she said.According to Kwan, she would rather not take any chances. Besides, she believes that the island resort will be packed with tourists in the first few months following the implementation of the pilot project.“Let the other tourists have all the fun first. For now, I am still more comfortable staying at home and away from crowded places,” she concluded.\n",

      "Lifestyle\n",
      "AGENCY\n",
      "Visual artist Lui Cheng Thak picked a mouth-watering theme for his first online art exhibition.He wanted to capture that feel of excitement and discovery when people hop from stall to stall, sampling street food, both sweet and savoury, that have stood the test of time and remained firm favourites among the young and old.In Colour Of Taste, he decided to illustrate his love of hawker food with a series of incredibly detailed sketches and paintings.On canvas, Lui offers a tour of his favourite food haunts around the Klang Valley.\"When I walk around the streets of a city, there is 'taste' that is unchanged among things that are overlooked by most of us. During the pandemic, many people miss dining in and travelling interstate for food hunts. Some homesick Malaysians who are stranded overseas miss the taste of authentic street food too. So I use colours to record the varieties of cuisine, feelings to describe time, lines to evoke appetite and taste. All these are used to describe the memory of taste,\" says Lui, 54.Known for his paintings of historical buildings, culture and heritage, the Negri Sembilan-born artist plays with the colours of street food in his 11th solo exhibition, Colour Of Taste, at Kuala Lumpur-based Pinkguy Gallery.It features a series of 12 oil on linen works, which can be viewed here.\"There are 12 different scenes of 'taste' here, with each painting named after colours such as Blue, Turquoise, Yellow Ochre and Cobalt Violet. These paintings capture our favourite Malaysian street food: claypot chicken rice, bak kut teh, char kuey teow, lemang, nasi lemak and many more,\" he says.What is special about these paintings is that they have different visual effects depending on the lighting.\"Some people think I just paint heritage buildings, scenes and people but that’s not it; the important thing is I am painting time, taste and feel. I use the contrast of colours and light because, for me, the atmosphere of a painting depends on the feeling and the taste, just like how the light and shadows on paintings have different effects. So although the painting is the same, the meanings are abstract as it changes as seen at different times by different people,” he says.Lui shares that the idea for this series came about at the end of 2020 when the country was dealing with movement control order (MCO) restrictions, a muddle of standard operating procedures (SOPs) and a spike in Covid-19 cases.\"As a photography enthusiast, I captured the scenes using my camera while taking away food or walking amid the food stalls. Then I sketched and painted using my colours and other elements to describe my feeling and taste for each of the cuisine and street food,\" he says.He describes Malaysian food as intriguing, a melting pot of flavours, ingredients and techniques.\"There are Chinese and Indian influences as well as Malay, and it can be confusing, at least initially. That is what makes Malaysia unique; not only its culture and heritage but also its multi-ethnic cuisine that is known to people across the globe. That's how I express my love towards Malaysian food through paintings,\" he says.Lui's artistic journey started in 1987 when he pursued his diploma in art and design at the Kuala Lumpur College of Art.His artworks mainly focus on architecture buildings from historical states like Penang, Melaka as well as Kuala Lumpur, which highlight the need to preserve historical landscapes in the midst of a rapidly urbanising city.He often spends about two to three weeks working on each painting.\"For example when I draw buildings, I need to know the history behind the building such as when it was built and what its function was. In visiting these heritage buildings, I get to discover their beauty and add some of my own element in my artwork,\" he adds.The online exhibition, which also marks Lui's latest attempt in creating smaller art pieces, will run till Sept 29. – Bernama\n",

Other celebrities joining the show include Oh Sang Wook, the Korean fencer who recently won a gold medal for his country in the Tokyo Olympics and 14-year-old actor Jung Dong-won. More celebrities will be recruited by the station soon.The variety show revolves around the challenge of learning how to play badminton. And it is not just fun and games. The participants will have to take the sport seriously as they will eventually participate in a national competition.Seungkwan may have an edge over his co-stars as he recently revealed in an interview that he was really into badminton these days. \"I joined a badminton club without revealing my identity,\" he said.

      "AGENCY\n",
      "Winemakers in northern Greece are diving into the unknown by plunging hundreds of bottles of their wine into the depths of the local river.Far from the sea or any lakes, producers in the town of Naoussa have decided to age some of their wine in the cool running waters of the Arapitsa river.As a band ceremoniously played traditional Greek songs, a crane lowered a large metal crate holding around 500 bottles of wine from off the riverbank.Around 22 makers of Xinomavro, a wine made from a dark-skinned grape variety, proudly watched, hoping the water cellar will broaden the varieties of the products.\"The bottles are placed at a 12m (about 40ft) depth and we aim to keep them there for at least 12 years,\" George Fountoulis, president of the Vaeni Naoussa wine cooperative which represents half of the region's wine production, told AFP.Tests will be done on an annual basis to check how the process evolves, he added.'Burgundy of Greece'It's part of a trend in recent years by winemakers to test the benefits of a deep soak – including in the ocean – on the wine ageing process.Some scientists say one year underwater is equivalent to three years in a cellar.Naoussa's vineyards are located on the slopes of Mount Vermio and mostly produce Xinomavro, whose name translates roughly as \"acid black\" or \"sour black\".Some 5,500 tonnes of Xinomavro wine are produced here annually. The wine is also exported to more than 45 countries.\"Naoussa is the city of wine, the Burgundy of Greece as we call it here,\" said Naoussa mayor Nikolas Karanikolas.\"This is an experiment and we will wait to see how the identity of the wine will evolve in these conditions. Our winemakers are well-organised, extroverted and always innovative.\"Oenologists do not know what the outcome will be but are excited by the whole process.\"We know that oxygen is insoluble in water, the average temperature of which we estimate will be 16°C,\" oenologist George Diamantakos said.\"The hygienic condition of the water is excellent and we want to see how the sun and the natural environment of the river will affect the wine.\"Impact of heat and droughtThe Naoussa area mainly has small family wineries with limited production. In the past, nearly every house had its own vineyard.\"We call Xinomavro 'the Barolo of the poor' but we are very proud of our products,\" said Petros Karydas, referring to Italy's sought-after wine.Karydas runs a small vineyard that produces about 12,000 bottles of wine a year, some of which are exported to Britain and the United States.But other challenges posed by the effects of a warming climate are more of a concern for wine industry professional Nana Chrysochoou than the results of the experiment.The winery set up by her father produces the only white wine placed in the water cellar and is from a local grape variety that he revived in his vineyards.\"Year after year, we see climate change having an even greater negative impact on vineyards,\" she told AFP.\"Especially this year, our plants went into a big shock due to the prolonged heatwave and drought. I do not know if the crop will last in 20 years' time, if the same climatic conditions continue.\" – AFP Relaxnews\n",

      "Disability remains a taboo subject in the music industry. This is the unfortunate finding of a new British consultation funded by the Arts Council England.The phenomenon is such that some professionals in the sector refuse to talk about their health condition or impairment for fear of reprisals.The study is based on the testimonies of several hundred artists and other professionals in the music industry. More than 70% of them identified as suffering from a disability (motor, neurological, sensory or cognitive) or a long-term health condition that is non-visible.Although this term covers a wide range of realities, most of the people concerned \"sometimes\" or \"never\" disclose their health condition to their colleagues.While two-thirds of the survey respondents believe that this information is not relevant in a professional context, many are worried about appearing less competent or facing discrimination.What's even more concerning is that one in four respondents worry about missing out on job opportunities because of their disability.\"Some employers tried to make the accommodations I needed. One employer told me it was not their job. Another told me that I was lying and wanted to get disability (benefits),\" explains one respondent.Feeling like a burdenThe study also found that professionals with invisible disabilities put their health at risk by choosing not to disclose their health concerns in the workplace. Three-quarters of those surveyed reported this unfortunate experience.\"I am getting better at asking for my needs, but in the past I often did not want to ask for too much and feel like a burden. As years have gone by and I have gotten more comfortable, this pattern has decreased,\" said one respondent.The vast majority of respondents, however, agreed on the need to give more prominence to people with disabilities in music.A previous report from the Arts Council England, dating from 2018, had already warned about their under-representation in all areas of the industry. At the time, the organisation found that only 1.8% of professionals in the sector had a disability.Ben Price, founder of Harbourside Artist Management, is one such professional. He himself has an invisible health condition, which helped motivate him to oversee this industry consultation.\"With my own lived experiences, I was keen to embark on this research. I myself have a disability that I didn't feel able to disclose, and I wanted to explore the perspectives of others in a similar position, as well as solutions of what can be done to improve disabled representation in the music industry.\"This aim is not necessarily to ask more people to disclose their disabilities, but to encourage an environment where those conversations are normalised and more people with a disability or long-term health condition can be welcomed into the industry – at all levels – without barriers.\" – AFP Relaxnews\n",

Authorities have particularly called for minors to be better protected from online dangers including \"blind\" and \"chaotic\" worship of internet celebrities.Popular social messaging app WeChat, owned by Tencent, also has a \"youth mode\", which when turned on, limits young users' access to some games and functionalities such as payments or the ability to find nearby friends.(Reporting by Ryan Woo; editing by Richard Pullin)\n",

For one things, the vast majority of cars don't have webcams, while dispaying video footage on a screen for the driver is banned in many places.The new car feature is limited to Apple users for now, however.

      "Electric scooters have taken over the streets of many a city, adding to the numbers of ways that people can cover short distances quickly. If you're in the market to buy one, instead of having to search out one to rent, there are a few factors to keep in mind.Who should buy one?\"The purchase is worthwhile, for example, for commuters who want to use the e-scooter for the last mile,\" says Marcel Muehlich of Auto Club Europa (ACE). It's also good for running quick errands or other regular trips, such as going to the gym or going out for cigarettes.Lars Zemke, the chairman of the German Federal Association of Small Electric Vehicles, says that he uses his e-scooter for the last 2 kilometres of his commute and has actually saved time by doing so.The local rules on owning and riding your e-scooter should also be taken into account. In some countries, you may have to register your e-scooter or get a permit for it, not to mention insurance.What to do before buying?Muehlich lists just a few of the things potential buyers should keep in mind: \"A test ride is obligatory; well-functioning brakes are the be-all and end-all; and a model with the largest possible wheels minimises the risk of accidents due to potholes.\"According to Zemke, some models now even offer turn signals.\"The driver then no longer has to give a hand signal when turning, so the danger of losing balance is eliminated,\" he explains.Practicality should also not be forgotten as a factor in deciding on an e-scooter. The scooter's weight and ability to be folded play a fundamental role in how easy it's going to be to schlepp it around.If you want to use the e-scooter as part of your commute, every kilo is important if you're taking it on public transport or the train.And don't forget that the battery factors into the overall load.An e-scooter with an integrated charger means it doesn't have to be taken along separately, and a removeable battery is easy to replace, according to Muehlich.He also advises air tyres instead of solid tyres if you want a comfortable ride: \"They provide a better driving experience because they absorb vibrations better on uneven ground.\"How much should it cost?\"While inexpensive models can be bought at discounters for as little as 200 euros (RM982), \"You have to dig much deeper into your wallet for high-quality e-scooters equipped with pneumatic tyres, wide handlebars and a powerful battery, for example,\" says Zemke.That kind of model runs closer to 2,000 euros (RM9,822), according to Muehlich.However, he also advises against a cheap model. Keep an eye out for cheap-looking components, he says, and if the e-scooter feels at all wobbly, it's a good reason to refrain from buying that model. — dpa\n",

      "Hundreds of Android smartphone owners have been venting their anger at Google after the tech giant's Clock app failed to activate its alarms following an update in late August.The Clock app, among the world's most widely used alarm apps with more than a billion downloads, is thought to have left many of its users snoozing in recent weeks due to a bug that sees the app remain silent and instead show a notification of a \"missed\" alarm.Google has since solved the problem with a Sept 7 update to the Clock app, according to the Google news website Androidpolice.com.\"The alarm didn't do anything. No vibration, no sound. Missed the alarm. Now I need a new job,\" reads one of hundreds of angry reviews on the Google Play Store since the start of September. \"Thanks for making me miss classes,\" says another.The problem occurred when users set the streaming service Spotify as their alarm sound in the Clock app. In most cases described by users, the app failed to begin streaming music or start any alarm, only showing a silent notification instead.Owners of Google's Pixel smartphones had been particularly affected by the problem, because Clock is installed there as the default alarm clock.Countless Clock app users appear to have now lost their trust the app, which has since been flooded with one-star reviews on the Google Play Store, while hundreds more have taken to Reddit to look for solutions.\"My wife and I [...] noticed our morning alarms [..] weren't showing as upcoming or going off at all,\" one user wrote on Reddit. \"After the alarm was set to go off it would simply show as 'missed'. Nothing happened at all.\"Google has now reportedly installed a backup alarm so that if Spotify does not start, a default alarm tone is used instead.Clock app users are strongly advised to head to the app's page of the Google Play Store on your smartphone to check if version 6.4.1 of the app is installed.Anyone affected by this who has now lost their trust in Google after it failed in the simple task of activating an alarm can may want to try the free, open-source alarm clock Simple Clock from the developer Mobile Simple Tools. – dpa\n",

      "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Google abused the dominant position of its Android operating system in India, using its \"huge financial muscle\" to illegally hurt competitors, the country's antitrust authority found in a report on its two-year probe seen by Reuters.Alphabet Inc's Google reduced \"the ability and incentive of device manufacturers to develop and sell devices operating on alternative versions of Android,\" says the June report by the Competition Commission of India's (CCI) investigations unit.The U.S. tech giant told Reuters in a statement it looks forward to working with the CCI to \"demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less.\"Google has not received the investigation report, a person with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.The CCI did not respond to a request for comment on the report. Senior CCI members will review the report and give Google another chance to defend itself, before issuing a final order, which could include penalties, said another person familiar with the case.Google would be able to appeal any order in India's courts.Its findings are the latest antitrust setback for Google in India, where it faces several probes in the payments app https://reut.rs/2B9ODC5 and smart television https://reut.rs/30JTioa markets. The company has been investigated in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. This week, South Korea's antitrust regulator fined Google https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorean-antitrust-agency-fines-google-177-mln-abusing-market-dominance-2021-09-14 $180 million for blocking customised versions of Android.'VAGUE, BIASED AND ARBITRARY'Google submitted at least 24 responses during the probe, defending itself and arguing it was not hurting competition, the report says.Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, as well as smartphone makers like Samsung and Xiaomi, were among 62 entities that responded to CCI questions during its Google investigation, the report says.Android powers 98% of India's 520 million smartphones, according to Counterpoint Research.When the CCI ordered the probe https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-india-antitrust-exclusive/exclusive-google-appears-to-have-leveraged-android-dominance-india-watchdog-idUSKCN1TT1Q2 in 2019, it said Google appeared to have leveraged its dominance to reduce device makers' ability to opt for alternate versions of its mobile operating system and force them to pre-install Google apps.The 750-page report finds the mandatory pre-installation of apps \"amounts to imposition of unfair condition on the device manufacturers\" in violation of India's competition law, while the company leveraged the position of its Play Store app store to protect its dominance.Play Store policies were \"one-sided, ambiguous, vague, biased and arbitrary\", while Android has been \"enjoying its dominant position\" in licensable operating systems for smartphones and tablets since 2011, the report says.The probe was triggered in 2019 after two Indian junior antitrust research associates and a law student filed a complaint https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-india-antitrust-idUSKCN1U40DY, Reuters reported.India remains a key growth market for Google. It said last year it would spend $10 billion https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-india-idINKCN24E0YL in the country over five to seven years through equity investments and tie-ups, its biggest commitment to a key growth market.(Reporting by Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Editing by William Mallard)\n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co Chief Executive Mary Barra said Friday the largest U.S. automaker plans to make changes in its supply chain as it works to address the continuing semiconductor chip crisis that has forced significant production cuts.\"We're going to make some pretty substantial shifts in our supply chain,\" Barra said in an online interview. \"We're already working much deeper into the tiered supply base because generally General Motors doesn't buy chips (directly) but (our suppliers do). But now we're building direct relationships with the manufacturers.\"A GM spokesman declined to comment further on how the company might shift its supply chain.Next week, the White House and the U.S. Commerce Department plan a meeting on the chip crisis, which has caused production cuts by automakers around the world.On Thursday, GM said it was cutting production at six North American assembly plants due to the shortage.Earlier this month, the company was forced to temporarily halt production at most North American assembly plants because of the shortage.Chrysler parent Stellantis NV said this week it was cutting additional production at three plants in the United States and Canada because of the shortage.Barra said Friday the issue is a \"solvable problem, but it's going to be here a little longer.\"The GM CEO, interviewed by Delta Air Lines chief Ed Bastian as part of a series of discussions with fellow CEOs, said some newer GM vehicles have up to 30% more chips than other vehicles.\"As customer needs are shifting, we need more and more semiconductors,\" Barra said, saying GM was looking for short-, medium- and long-term solutions to the shortage.Last week, GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson reaffirmed the automaker's 2021 profit outlook and said the company expects a \"more stable year\" in 2022 for semiconductor supplies.Jacobson cautioned GM's third-quarter wholesale deliveries could be down by 200,000 vehicles because of chip shortages and because GM shifted production into the second quarter as it managed semiconductor supplies.(Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n",

      "(Reuters) - Verizon Communications said on Friday it is increasing its subsidies on offer for Apple Inc's newly launched iPhone 13, in a bid to attract more customers to the U.S. carrier's network.Verizon said it would now offer trade-in subsidies of up to $1000, matching rival AT&T Inc, from $700 previously. The biggest subsidies will be given to customers who turn in the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 models.Apple's new range of iPhones come at an unchanged price, but carriers are using aggressive subsidies as a way to hold on to existing customers and attract new ones.The phones will also have custom 5G antennas and radio components for faster speeds. This push towards expanding 5G connectivity comes as telecom firms in the United States race to bolster their 5G infrastructure.The iPhone 13, starting at $699, promises better display, longer battery life and a Cinematic mode for automatically changing focus while taking videos. It will come with a new A15 Bionic chip that enables features like automatically translating text. All models will be available from Sept. 24.(Reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)\n",

Both roles have their charm and each faces their own challenges. It’s a co-op game, but you don’t get to share a screen with your co-player.Instead the agent player and the hacker player can sit at home in front of their own console or PC. Each player only sees their part of the game, so communication via headset is vital.As you might expect of a hacker, Alistar stays at his computer to work on high-tech tricks. He can see Angel on surveillance cameras and help her to penetrate secure areas.Angel, on the other hand, is out in the world, searching for clues and tracking down codes. The adventure can only succeed if both characters work well together.Another special feature of the game is that the roles of hacker and agent can be swapped around at any time.The game is available for PCs and the Playstation 5, and costs around US$15 (RM63). – dpa\n",

It has not been demonstrated to the DPC and Garante that comprehensive testing in the field was done by Facebook or Ray-Ban to ensure the indicator LED light is an effective means of giving notice.\"The Irish regulator said it shares the concerns of the Italian Data Protection Regulator, the Garante, which asked Facebook for clarifications on Sept. 10 to assess the smart glasses for compliance with privacy laws.

      "Swiss watchmaker brings back disco with its retro-aesthetic timepieces.LUXURY watchmaker Tissot has a long history of sharing its craft through stories. Since its beginning in 1853, it has woven the evolution of its era into its timepieces.A throwback to the 1970s, Tissot’s upgraded PRX Automatic reintroduces a sophisticated and young-at-heart piece with on-trend retro-aesthetics.This essential timepiece has an integrated case and bracelet, which is made remarkable by its slim, timeless and solid design – an ideal watch for those with a passion for design and an eye for ingenuity.The upgraded PRX Automatic – that subtly incorporates the style and design of the 70s – comes with a Powermatic 80 movement and an even edgier touch of style than its quartz predecessor.Deeply rooted in today’s design cues of the elegant sportswatch, this nod to the disco era is perfect for the man who wants to have fun with class and uses essentials of remarkable design to express his distinctive identity.Innovation by traditionInspired by its first design in 1978, the PRX 40 205 leaves a lasting impression and still makes the ritual of preparation as cool as the destination.The brand remembers the 1970s fondly, in particular the later years of the decade with radio airwaves buzzing with sultry soul voices over electronic beats and when the world was absorbed in the joyful, free-spirited style of disco mania, while the funky basslines of hip hop, house music and then techno were subtly building a head of steam.A time to escape from the shadow of the mainstream and topics of conversations on nailing the right outfit for Friday disco nights were shared throughout the entire week.Recalling a changing world, men’s fashion was following suit and had never been so glamorous, flamboyant and exciting.A time to show off signature style was part of the whole experience that required accuracy and attention to sophisticated detail.Modern retro twistFast-forward to the present, Tissot aims for its upgraded timepiece slender silhouette to fit perfectly under a shirt cuff or a jacket sleeve, essentially fitting seamlessly with most outfits.Not stealing the limelight but adding to a cool and sophisticated look, the embossed chequered pattern dials are available in blue and black with a silver bezel as well as silver with rose gold trimmings.Besides that, the collection is a timeless piece of design with a tapered case coupled with solid yet wearable satin-finish integrated bracelet that is also scratch-resistant with sapphire crystal and antireflective coating.The sapphire crystal offers extra protection against bumps and can take different forms to give the watch a variety of looks – flat, domed, concave or ground.Plus, its water-resistant feature of up to 100m adds to its everyday functionality for an active lifestyle. This is further embodied with its wrist movement which enables the mechanism to run.An automatic watch that is powered by the energy of the person who wears it, the Powermatic 80 movement boasts 80 hours of power reserve, which is enough to continue telling time accurately even if the watch is not worn for some three days.For more information on Tissot PRX Powermatic 80, visit https://www.tissotwatches.com/en-my/tissot-prx.html or its website and follow them on Facebook.\n",

      "TO be a family means its members support and uplift one another through thick and thin, which in multicultural Malaysia goes beyond ethnicity, religion and culture.This was the merry spirit of Keluarga Malaysia (Malaysian Family) – emphasising unity, consensus and togetherness – that infused the recent Malaysia Day 2021 celebration held at the Sabah International Convention Centre in Kota Kinabalu, despite the small scale of the event due to current Covid-19 situation.The event adhered to tight standard operating procedures, including two complete vaccination doses for event organisers and staff, as well as the 62 invited guests.Although the public was not allowed to physically attend the celebration, they were nevertheless able to access live viewing through their television screens and the social media pages of the Malaysian Information Department, in its capacity as the media and publicity committee for the National and Malaysia Day 2021 Celebrations.Graced by Yang Dipertua Negeri Sabah Tun Juhar Mahiruddin, the event was also attended by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Hajiji Noor and Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Amar Awang Tengah Ali Hasan as the representative of Sarawak Chief Minister, Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Tun Openg, among other honoured guests.The event, which saw Malaysians bearing witness to the special Malaysia Day Celebration book-signing ceremony that commemorates the 1963 formation of Malaysia, also heard speeches from the nation’s top leaders, with the common message of the Malaysian Family coming together to protect their families and Malaysia from the invisible enemy of Covid-19.“As a large Malaysian Family, we must be tolerant in all things, be respectful of one another and maintain unity across political ideology for the Malaysia that we love.“Apart from cross-culture national integration, the unity of the rakyat with diverse races, religions and ethnicities is one of the foundations of our strength as a successful country,” said Ismail Sabri in his speech, a rallying call for Malaysians to do their part to unite in the continued fight against Covid-19.Hajiji highlighted the value and importance of Malaysia Day as a cornerstone to creating a glorious future for Malaysia moving forward. He added, “The prerequisites for success against all tribulations are unity, togetherness and being united in the interests of our tanah air.“We welcome the inclusive Malaysian Family concept that cuts across race and religion as one that wisely coincides with the principles we hold in driving the nation-building agenda and community development for the future.“At the same time, it has the potential of fostering these prerequisites amongst the rakyat in combating the Covid-19 pandemic.”“We pray for the well-being and safety of Malaysia and the rakyat in strengthening their resolve in making Malaysia Day a success with high patriotic spirit. Together, let’s move towards achieving the aspiration of creating the Malaysian Family that is united in harmony, excellence and diversity,” said Communications and Multimedia Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa in his welcoming speech, which was followed by a message given by Sabah Deputy Chief Minister I Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin as the co-chairman of the main committee for the Malaysia Day 2021 Celebration.In line with this year’s theme of Malaysia Prihatin in celebrating patriotism, unity and love for the country, the night’s festivities featured an exciting array of cultural dances and patriotic song performances, as well as the Malaysia Prihatin video montage.What attracted the most attention, however, were Merdeka Negaraku, Jalur Perpaduan, Kita Perwira, Warna Warni Malaysia and Malaysia Prihatin. Involving an 18-minute stage performance by cultural artists from the Sabah Cultural Board, the performance acted as a symbol of unity reflecting combined values across ethnicities, religion, culture in Malaysian society.\n",
